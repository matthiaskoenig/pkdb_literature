Pharmacokinetic parameters following intravenous (i.v.)  administration of STZ (20 mg kg-1 body wt.) were measured in both STZ-treated  (control) and STZ plus probenecid-treated (treatment) groups. In order to assess  the renal clearance of STZ, bolus doses of STZ and inulin (40 mg kg-1 body wt.)  were injected i.v. either in the presence or absence of probenecid (40 mg kg-1  body wt.). The blood and urine concentrations of STZ were determined by capillary  gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the probenecid treatment group,  the area under the plasma disappearance and urinary excretion curves (AUC) of STZ  were significantly decreased (P < 0.01) and the volume of distribution (Vd) and  total clearance (CLt) were significantly increased statistically (P < 0.05 and P  < 0.01, respectively). No remarkable differences in the urine flow rate, urine pH  values, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or renal clearance were observed in the  treatment group. However, the clearance ratio in the treatment group was  significantly increased from 11.72 to 17.27. From these results, it is suggested  that the significant decrease of AUC, i.e. increase of disappearance of STZ in  plasma by co-administration with probenecid, is due to the increase of the  clearance ratio.","1992-12","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","385-391","","6","12","","J Appl Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1452971","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Half-Life; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism; Probenecid/*pharmacology; Stanozolol/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pharmacokinetic analysis by use of  noncompartmental methods showed an overall half-life of rhSOD to be about 4 hours  for doses from 3 mg/kg to 45 mg/kg. The peak concentrations ranged from 24 to 837  mg/L, and urinary excretion increased from 3% to 57% of total dose after single  intravenous bolus administrations of the drug from 1 mg/kg to 45 mg/kg. The mean  renal clearance of rhSOD initially increased with dose then plateaued at the  highest dose, whereas the nonrenal clearance decreased with dose to a plateau;  total clearance remained essentially constant. The progressive increase in renal  clearance may be explained by saturation of the tubular reabsorption and  degradation of the protein, a mechanism previously described in animal models.","1991-12","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:02","","713-720","","6","50","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1752116","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Reference Values; Single-Blind Method; Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; Inulin/metabolism; Cardiovascular System/drug effects; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Superoxide Dismutase/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because total plasma C12,  which results from the sum of both free and albumin binding fractions, was  measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, an in vitro experimental  session was carried out to determine the binding curve of C12 in rat plasma.  These data were then used to calculate the plasma C12 free fraction in in vivo  experiments. The best fit obtained for the experimental data of albumin binding  was obtained with the equation of reversible, saturable binding to one, two, or  three classes of noninteracting equivalent sites. Only a single binding site was  clearly identified with a dissociation constant of 147 mumol/L and a maximal  predicted binding of 1.57 mol/mol albumin. The urinary excretion of C12 was 3.90  +/- 1.62% of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by  one-compartment model with linear transfer to the tissues, taking into account  simultaneously both plasma concentration and urine excretion data.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity of this formula  for Japanese patients with cancer and modify it for this population. The GFR was  measured on the basis of inulin clearance, which is considered to reflect the  accurate GFR. Inulin clearance was measured in 28 patients with cancer. The  adjusted 24-h creatinine clearance (24-h Ccr) was unbiased (mean prediction error  [MPE] ± SE = -2.3 ± 4.5%) and acceptably precise (root mean squared error =  23.7%) for GFR assessment. The pharmacokinetics of carboplatin were analyzed in  21 patients with a GFR of 17.2-91.4 mL/min. The original Calvert formula  overestimated carboplatin clearance, resulting in an MPE of 14.3%. When we  revised the Calvert formula for Japanese patients by substituting a non-renal  clearance of 15 for 25, that is, dose = target AUC × (GFR + 15), the MPE  decreased to -0.1% (P < 0.001).

We did parallel studies on  cyclosporine pharmacokinetics and renal function in patients who had a recent  kidney transplant and were given cyclosporine as a part of their  immunosuppressive therapy. Seven consecutive renal transplant patients were  studied at the end of a month of treatment while on different oral cyclosporine  doses (5, 3.5, 2.5, or 1.5 mg/kg, twice a day, respectively). Cyclosporine  pharmacokinetics profiles and renal function parameters (GFR and renal plasma  flow [RPF], as inulin and p-amino hippurate clearances, respectively) were  determined before and over a 12-hr period after each single dose of cyclosporine.  Plasma levels and urinary excretion rate of endothelin were also studied before  and after the highest cyclosporine dose (5 mg/kg). Mean trough levels, area under  the curve values, and maximum concentration of blood cyclosporine were comparable  after 5 and 3.5 mg/kg cyclosporine and decreased in a dose-dependent manner after  the lower doses (2.5 and 1.5 mg/kg). In the same patients GFR declined on average  63%, 53%, 35%, and 18%, 2-4 hr after maximum cyclosporine concentration was  reached. As blood levels of cyclosporine returned to trough, GFR progressively  increased to baseline. Similar results were found for RPF; 5 mg/kg cyclosporine  did not modify endothelin plasma levels. By contrast, urinary excretion of the  peptide increased significantly (P less than 0.01) in the 6 hr that followed  cyclosporine administration and returned within the normal range in the  subsequent 6 hr. Following each oral administration of cyclosporine, 2-4 hr after  peak blood concentration was reached, patients showed renal hypoperfusion,  transient and rapidly reversible. This was associated with an increased urinary  endothelin excretion rate that was also transient. It is speculated that an  excessive renal synthesis of endothelin is the cause of the daily renal  hypoperfusion observed in patients with renal transplants given cyclosporine.","1992-07","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:59:11","","56-60","","1","54","","Transplantation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1631945","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; *Kidney Transplantation; Endothelins/blood; Cyclosporine/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Renal Circulation/*drug effects; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study compared the  pharmacokinetics and experimental nephrotoxicity of chronic CSA in both the  genetically-hyperlipidemic rat model and the lean litter-mate. Once daily dosing  (25 mg/kg via gavage) was either at the start of the active (1900) or inactive  (0700) cycle (Nov 1987 to Jan 1988). Serial serum samples following the final  dose were assayed by both polyclonal (nonspecific) and monoclonal (specific for  parent CSA) RIA. Renal toxicity was assessed by 24-hr creatinine clearances,  fractional clearances of sodium and potassium, and inulin clearances (CIN).  Despite a greater than 2-fold increase in serum CSA concentrations, there were no  changes in renal function in obese rats dosed at the start of the active period  compared to the inactive period. Furthermore, mean CIN of the lean group  administered drug at the start of the active period was not significantly  different from time-matched placebo-treated lean rats. However, there was an 80%  drop in CIN in rats treated with CSA at the start of the inactive period compared  to control group. There were no differences in electrolyte handling. Insulin  concentrations, independent of time of dosing, were markedly elevated in obese  rats dosed CSA compared to placebo-treated obese or both lean groups. Serum  triglyceride levels were significantly correlated with pharmacokinetic parameters  of total but not parent CSA. In summary, significant differences in toxicity were  observed due to time of dosing and lipid profiles. Although the mechanism of this  action remains unclear, it appears that increased non-fasting serum triglyceride  levels following the active period most likely reduced CSA distribution into  kidney tissue preventing the dose-limiting nephrotoxicity.","1988","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","353-362","","4","5","","Chronobiol Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3069229","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Cyclosporins/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Insulin/blood; Triglycerides/blood; *Circadian Rhythm; Rats, Zucker; Organ Size/drug effects; Creatinine/metabolism; Inulin; Kidney/drug effects/pathology; Potassium/urine; Sodium/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The active metabolite of benazepril, benazeprilat, is  eliminated principally ( approximately 85%) via biliary excretion in cats. A  total of 20 control animals and 32 cats with moderate renal insufficiency induced  by partial nephrectomy were used. Assessments were made at steady state after  treatment with placebo or benazepril (0.25-2 mg/kg) once daily for a minimum of  10 days. The PK endpoint was the AUC (0-->24 h) of total plasma benazeprilat. The  PD endpoints were systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures (respectively SBP,  DBP and MBP) measured by telemetry, and plasma ACE activity, assessed by an ex  vivo assay. Renal function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate (GFR),  measured by inulin clearance, and plasma creatinine concentrations (1/PCr). As  compared with control animals, the renal insufficient cats had a 78% reduction in  GFR (0.57 +/- 0.41 mL/min kg), increased plasma creatinine (2.7 +/- 1.0 mg/dL),  urea (44.0 +/- 11.9 mg/dL) and ACE activity, and moderately increased blood  pressure (SBP 171.8 +/- 5.1 mmHg) (all parameters P < 0.05). Renal insufficient  cats receiving benazepril had significantly (P < 0.05) lower SBP, DBP, MBP and  ACE, and higher GFR values as compared with placebo-treated animals. There were  no significant differences in SBP, DBP, MBP, benazeprilat or ACE values according  to the degree of renal insufficiency in cats receiving benazepril.

Hyperbilirubinemia in EHBRs had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and  renal handling of unbound enprofylline.

Different to other low-molecular weight  heparins (LMWHs), certoparin does not accumulate in maintenance dialysis patients  for unknown reasons. The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact  of the dialysis procedure on the removal of certoparin. In a subgroup of the  MEMBRANE study consisting of 12 patients, the pharmacokinetics of certoparin  during hemodialysis was determined by means of the anti-Xa activity. In addition,  the elimination of certoparin into continuously collected dialysate was assessed.  Further, in vitro experiments with human blood-simulating high-flux hemodialysis  and hemofiltration were performed to quantify the elimination and the sieving  coefficients SK of the two LMWHs certoparin and enoxaparin compared with  unfractionated heparin (UFH). The surrogate marker middle molecules inulin and  myoglobin served as reference solutes during the experiments. Finally, the  adsorption of (125) iodine-radiolabeled certoparin onto the synthetic dialysis  membrane was quantified. The clinical study reconfirmed the absence of  bioaccumulation of certoparin with anti-Xa activities between <0.01 and  0.02 IU/mL after 24 h. A short plasma half-life time of 2.0 ± 0.7 h was  determined during hemodialysis. Of the total certoparin dose injected  intravenously prior to hemodialysis, only 2.7% was eliminated into dialysate. The  in vitro experiments further revealed only 6% of certoparin to be adsorbed onto  the dialysis membrane. The anti-Xa activities of certoparin and enoxaparin slowly  declined during in vitro hemofiltration to 87.3 ± 5.5 and 82.5 ± 9.4% of  baseline, respectively, while inulin and myoglobin concentrations rapidly  decreased. The anti-Xa activity of UFH remained unchanged. The SK of both LMWH  and UFH was very low in hemofiltration and particularly in hemodialysis with  values ≤0.1. The elimination kinetics during hemodialysis suggests strong  protein-binding of certoparin. Different from LMWH significantly cleared by the  kidneys, the relatively short half-life time of certoparin of only 2 h during  hemodialysis allows a more reliable control of the anti-coagulatory effects and  decreases the risk of bleeding complications. Dialytic removal does not  significantly contribute to the clearance of certoparin in maintenance dialysis  patients.","2015-11","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:00:18","","951-959","","11","39","","Artif Organs","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25900127","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; In Vitro Techniques; *Renal Dialysis; End-stage renal disease; Unfractionated heparin; Hemodialysis; Anticoagulants/*pharmacokinetics; Bioaccumulation; Enoxaparin/pharmacokinetics; Hemofiltration; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/*pharmacokinetics; Heparin/pharmacokinetics; Low-molecular weight heparin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lipopolysaccharide delayed the disappearance of  tobramycin from plasma in a dose-dependent manner. A dose-dependent decrease in  systemic clearance of tobramycin was observed, although the elimination rate  constant and fraction of urinary recovery of unchanged drug were not  significantly different in any group. Lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased  the central compartment volume of distribution of tobramycin, but did not  influence the steady-state volume of distribution. A dose-related increase in the  ratio of the rate constant of transfer to the peripheral compartment to the rate  constant of transfer from peripheral compartment to central compartment was  observed. The glomerular filtration rate was significantly decreased by  pretreatment with 250 micrograms kg-1 lipopolysaccharide and the clearance ratio  was decreased by 20%, indicating that lipopolysaccharide increases the tubular  reabsorption of tobramycin.

The main  metabolic organs of reteplase are the kidneys, liver, and blood, whereas human  tissue-type plasminogen activator is predominantly cleared by the liver. Recent  studies showed that reteplase plasma concentrations were significantly increased  in severe acute renal failure. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate  whether the degree of renal failure influences the pharmacokinetic properties of  reteplase. Subacute renal failure in rats was induced by bilateral 1-hr clamping  of the renal arteries and recovery for 3 or 6 days. Acute renal failure was  induced by bilateral surgical nephrectomy. Renal function was assessed by inulin  clearance. The plasma concentration of functionally active reteplase was measured  by an indirect spectrophotometric assay. Reteplase was administered as a  double-bolus intravenous injection of 140 + 140 kU/kg, 30 min apart.

To elucidate the mechanism of this diuretic  resistance, we measured para-aminohippurate and inulin clearances and urinary  excretion of electrolytes, prostaglandin E2, and furosemide after intravenous  administration of 80 mg of furosemide in 26 patients. The natriuretic response  was variable (3.3-172 mEq/h) and was unrelated to basal sodium excretion, renal  clearances, or urinary prostaglandin E2. Natriuresis correlated negatively with  plasma aldosterone (r = -0.54, p less than 0.01), and strongly with urinary  furosemide (range 5.5-76 mg/h, r = 0.71, p less than 0.001). As urinary  furosemide excretion reflects the amount of furosemide reaching the active site  on the luminal side of the tubule, the data demonstrate markedly reduced amounts  of furosemide at its primary site of action in patients with diuretic resistance.  Plasma furosemide was higher in patients with reduced furosemide excretion and  impaired natriuresis, suggesting that the defect was an impairment of furosemide  transport into the tubule. Thus, a major factor in diuretic resistance is altered  furosemide pharmacokinetics.","1987-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:59:10","","294-298","","2","92","","Gastroenterology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3466836","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Drug Resistance; p-Aminohippuric Acid; Dinoprostone; Inulin; Furosemide/*metabolism/therapeutic use; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic/*drug therapy; Natriuresis/*drug effects; Prostaglandins E/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of the four drugs, ACNU  was tolerated best and at doses of 0.2 to 0.8 mg/week for 8 consecutive weeks. We  found that the average half-time for CSF elimination of ACNU was 18 min (range,  12 to 38 min). This value exceeded the known rate of ACNU decomposition in  aqueous solution (28 to 29 min), implying that the disappearance of ACNU from CSF  was due to hydrolytic decomposition and cellular entry and/or transcapillary loss  across central nervous system capillaries. The drug exposure integral (C X t) of  ACNU in the CSF after a ""toxic dose low"" of 0.8 mg in the dogs would achieve the  equivalent of in vitro cell kills in excess of 3 logs for rat 9L and human glioma  126 cells. As a potential therapeutic agent for meningeal neoplasia, the major  limiting factor may be that the CSF elimination of ACNU is rapid compared to its  equilibration time from ventricle to spinal- and cerebral convexity-subarachnoid  space.

In the pharmacokinetic  experiments, one group of animals received an i.v. dose of SA (1.5 or 3 mg/kg),  the second group received an intravesical dose of 30 mg/kg (approximately 0.3 ml)  and the third group received concomitantly an i.v. tracer dose of [14C] SA and an  intravesical dose of unlabeled SA (30 mg/kg). The intravesical dose was removed  after 90 min. The intravesical administration of SA produced maximal blood  concentrations of 10.8 +/- 5.6 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D., n = 10) at 90 to 100  min. The fraction of the intravesical dose recovered after 90 min was between 45  and 75%, which indicates an upper limit of 25 to 55% loss by processes including  absorption. The bioavailability of the intravesical dose, calculated from the  blood data and the clearance of the i.v. doses, was between 4 and 23% and  averaged about 13%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1991-07-01","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","357-364","","1","258","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2072307","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Injections, Intravenous; Biological Availability; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Absorption; Rats, Inbred F344; Inulin/metabolism; Sodium Salicylate/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Urinary Bladder/*metabolism/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LPS (50 and 250 micrograms/kg) was infused for 20 to  30 min 2 hr before an intravenous administration of enprofylline (2.5 mg/kg). LPS  induced a decrease in the systemic clearance and an increase in the volume of  distribution at the steady state of enprofylline without any histological changes  in the kidneys. No changes in the protein-binding parameters of enprofylline were  observed between the control and LPS-pretreated groups, although LPS slightly  decreased the albumin concentration in plasma. LPS caused decreases in the  apparent maximum capacity of transport (Vmax) from 71.24 to 15.02 micrograms/min,  in the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) from 3.04 to 1.42 micrograms/ml, and in the  glomerular filtration rate as estimated for inulin clearance from 3.10 to 1.87  ml/min. These results indicate that LPS decreases both the affinity and capacity  of the tubular transport system, and in turn decreases the tubular secretory  intrinsic clearance of enprofylline as shown by Vmax/KM. The mechanism for  inducing changes in the pharmacokinetic behavior and renal handling of  enprofylline by LPS may be related to the effects of LPS on tubular secretion of  enprofylline and its distribution in the organs and peripheral tissues.","1993-08","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","611-616","","4","21","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8104119","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Drug Interactions; Rats, Wistar; Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology; Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism; Bronchodilator Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Klebsiella pneumoniae/metabolism; Xanthines/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have previously reported a close association between  diabetes and increased oxygen usage, partly due to increased tubular electrolyte  transport secondary to glomerular hyperfiltration during the early onset of  diabetes. Several studies have shown that acute administration of C-peptide to  diabetic rats with glomerular hyperfiltration results in normalized glomerular  filtration rate (GFR). In this study, we validated a novel method for precise and  repetitive GFR measurements in conscious rats and used C-peptide injection in  diabetic rats for evaluation. First, GFR was determined in normoglycemic control  rats before and after C-peptide administration. Thereafter, all rats were made  diabetic by an i.v. streptozotocin injection. Fourteen days later, GFR was again  determined before and after C-peptide administration. GFR was estimated from  plasma clearance curves using a single bolus injection of FITC-inulin, followed  by serial blood sampling over 155 min. FITC-inulin clearance was calculated using  non-compartmental pharmacokinetic data analysis. Baseline GFR in normoglycemic  controls was 2.10 +/- 0.18 ml/min, and was unaffected by C-peptide (2.23 +/- 0.14  ml/min). Diabetic rats had elevated GFR (3.06 +/- .034 ml/min), which was  normalized by C-peptide (2.35 +/- 0.30 ml/min). In conclusion, the used method  for estimation of GFR in conscious animals result in values that are in good  agreement with those obtained from traditional GFR measurements on anaesthetized  rats. However, multiple measurements from the same conscious subject can be  obtained using this method. Furthermore, as previously shown on anaesthetized  rats, C-peptide also normalizes GFR in hyperfiltrating conscious diabetic rats.","2009","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","219-225","","","645","","Adv Exp Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19227475","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects; C-Peptide/*therapeutic use; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*drug therapy/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We previously showed that AGEs produce an  increase in vascular permeability and generated an oxidant stress after binding  to the receptor (RAGE) present on endothelium. RAGE, a 35-kDa protein that  belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been cloned from a rat lung cDNA  library, and recombinant rat soluble RAGE (rR-RAGE) has been produced in insect  cells. The sequence of RAGE is highly conserved between human and rat. We studied  the biological effect of rR-RAGE and pharmacokinetics of 125I-rR-RAGE after  intravenous or intraperitoneal administration in normal and  streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. rR-RAGE prevented albumin or inulin  transfer through a bovine aortic endothelial cell monolayer, restored the  hyperpermeability observed in diabetic rats or induced in normal rats by diabetic  rat red blood cells, and corrected the reactive oxygen intermediate production  after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration. After intravenous injection  of 125I-rR-RAGE, the distribution half-life was longer (p < or = 0.01) in  diabetic (0.15 and 4.01 hr) than in normal (0.02 and 0.21 hr) rats, as was the  case for the elimination half-lives (diabetic, 57.17 hr; normal, 26.02 hr; p < or  = 0.01). Distribution volume was higher in diabetic than in normal rats (6.94 and  3.24 liter/kg, respectively; p = 0.049).

PROCEDURES: 9 plasma samples were  obtained from each dog at 5 minutes to 6 hours after IV bolus injection of  iohexol and inulin.

Results for 3 limited-sample strategies for determination  of plasma clearance of iohexol and inulin were compared with results for the  reference method. RESULTS: Mean clearance of inulin and iohexol for the reference  method was 2.72 and 2.48 mL/min/kg, respectively. The mean difference between  clearance of these 2 markers for the reference method was 0.24 mL/min/kg. In  general, use of the limited-sample strategies yielded clearance values similar to  those for the reference method.

The average CLRcz (mean +/- SD) was  higher in cystic fibrosis patients (125 +/- 20 ml/min/1.73 m2) than in healthy  controls (100 +/- 9 ml/min/1.73 m2) [p less than 0.005].

The  mean renal clearance ratios of ceftazidime to inulin were close to unity after  both the single dose and low and high dose steady-state infusions both in cystic  fibrosis patients and in controls. These findings suggest that the glomerular  filtration rate is the principal determinant of the elimination rate of  ceftazidime. However, in all cystic fibrosis patients with a CL inul exceeding  125 ml/min/1.73 m2 the clearance ratio was below unity, indicating tubular  reabsorption of ceftazidime occurs in these individuals. The results demonstrate  a higher but also more variable GFR in cystic fibrosis patients (74 to 174  ml/min/1.73 m2), resulting in increased and accordingly variable ability to  eliminate ceftazidime in cystic fibrosis.

The present study  investigated the coadministration of CSA with a unique hemorheologic agent,  pentoxifylline (PTX), in the murine model. A total of 48 rats were orally dosed  with CSA 25 mg/kg for 10 days with either PTX 45 mg/kg i.p. or saline every 12  hr. Posttreatment renal function, assessed by creatinine (CCR) and inulin (CIN)  clearances and renal electrolyte handling, was compared with baseline data and  between groups. In an attempt to assess prostaglandin-mediated changes in enteral  absorption, oral CSA pharmacokinetics with and without PTX were compared to the  pharmacokinetics of similar groups (N = 8) administered i.v. CSA. Mean CIN of  rats coadministered CSA and PTX (942 +/- 214 microliters/min/g KW) was similar to  control rats 884 +/- 185 microliters/min/g KW); both were significantly greater  than CSA alone (537 +/- 211 microliters/min/g KW; p less than .01). Likewise,  percent of baseline CCR was significantly reduced in rats treated CSA (61 +/-  24%) compared to controls 113 +/- 41%) and rats coadministered PTX (117 +/- 75%;  p less than .05). No differences in percent change from baseline electrolyte  handling were observed among groups. Further, no differences in CSA  pharmacokinetics with or without PTX were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1989","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","97-104","","2-3","11","","Ren Fail","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2516344","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Disease Models, Animal; Biological Availability; Random Allocation; Kidney/drug effects; Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced/metabolism/*prevention & control; Cyclosporins/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Epoprostenol/biosynthesis; Pentoxifylline/*therapeutic use; Theobromine/*analogs & derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Female conscious  dogs were given an intravenous infusion of p-aminohippuric acid and inulin, and,  after a 90-min control period, the infusion was either continued or AVP was added  to the infusate to produce doses of 0, 40, 100, and 200 microU.kg-1.min-1 for the  last 90 min of the experiment. The resulting PAVP levels were 1.2, 8.2, 11.4, and  21.6 microU/ml, respectively. The urinary clearance rate of AVP nearly doubled  between the infusion rates of 0 and 100 microU.kg-1.min-1. Likewise, the  nonurinary plasma clearance rate of AVP also nearly doubled between the infusion  rates of 40 and 100 microU.kg-1.min-1. However, at the rate of infusion of 200  microU.kg-1.min-1, both the urinary and nonurinary clearance rates were unchanged  compared with the 100-microU.kg-1.min-1 rate. The largest incremental rise in  PAVP was observed between the doses of 100 and 200 microU.kg-1.min-1, when the  clearance rates were apparently plateaued. The urinary excretion rate of AVP was  linearly correlated with PAVP (R = 0.91) under the conditions of this study. The  results suggest that the measurement of the urinary excretion rate of AVP is a  reliable method of assessing PAVP and that the clearance of AVP increases when  PAVP is elevated.","1989-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:26","","R291-298","","2 Pt 2","256","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2916692","","","","Female; Animals; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Dogs; Blood Pressure; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Heart Rate; Renal Circulation; Potassium/urine; Sodium/urine; Arginine Vasopressin/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear binding was found for penicillin G, methicillin, dicloxacillin,  and ampicillin; however, nonlinear binding was observed for penicillin V and  cefazolin. After intravenous bolus dosing, cefazolin was recovered almost  completely in urine and bile, while for the penicillins, penicilloic acid was  found to be the major metabolite. Biliary excretion of cefazolin followed  Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and no significant inhibition of urinary secretion was  observed after probenecid administration. The renal clearance of unbound drug was  0.82 ml/min with a reabsorption ratio (R) of 0.22.

Erythrocyte uptake, serum protein  binding, and tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient (Kp) were measured.  Theoretical Kp values were calculated and found to be in good agreement with the  Kp values for three of the antibiotics. Plasma and tissue concentrations (lung,  heart, muscle, skin, gut, bone, liver, and kidney) were measured as a function of  time at various doses for inulin and cefazolin in rats after an intravenous bolus  dose, and were found to be in reasonable agreement with concentrations predicted  by the model.

Then a kinetic model  for the degradation of liposomes in blood was developed, assuming that the  degradation follows the first order rate process for each dose. The model fitted  the observed time courses of excreted 3H-inulin well, and dose dependency could  be observed in the rate constants for liposome degradation, which are more  sensitive than urinary excretion of 3H-inulin. The degradation rate constant  correlated well with the uptake rate constant, which suggests the same underlying  mechanism for both uptake and degradation.

Distribution of both L-DXR and L-INU into the liver was parallel  and extensive, while in the heart, the pattern of distribution differed between  L-DXR and L-INU after peak concentration. Time courses of tissue concentration  were explained well by dividing tissue into a shallow compartment with efflux and  a deep compartment without efflux. In the liver, pharmacokinetic parameters of  L-DXR and L-INU were similar, and the two kinetically different compartments may  correspond to different uptake processes in hepatic endocytosis. In the heart,  the shallow compartment was considered to correspond to the cardiac vascular  space, and the intercompartmental rate constant (k3) for L-DXR was much larger  than that for L-INU. The estimated half-life for this process was 20 min. The  half-life for the degradation of liposomes in blood circulation was also  estimated at 20 min from data on the urinary excretion of released 3H-inulin.

The glomerular filtration rate (inulin  clearance) and urine osmolality remained nearly unchanged, whereas renal plasma  flow (PAH clearance) increased on ibopamine administration. Urinary sodium and  potassium excretion were slightly but insignificantly elevated. Pharmacokinetic  parameters of ibopamine were unaltered in impaired renal function, both on the  first and seventh treatment day. Maximum plasma levels of the active metabolite  epinine were achieved after 45 min and were higher on the first as compared with  the seventh treatment day in both groups. In conclusion, ibopamine caused a  relevant increase in stroke volume and cardiac output associated with a rise in  renal perfusion and urine output in patients with normal and with impaired renal  function. Ibopamine is an orally active derivative of dopamine and is used for  treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, who frequently have an  impaired renal function. Therefore, in the present study, the hemodynamic effects  and kinetic behavior of ibopamine should be investigated in patients with  different degrees of renal function.","1995-07","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:28","","469-477","","7","2","","Am J Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11850693","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: After an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of  the markers, the decay curves of their plasma concentrations were monitored for  29 hr by 16 plasma samples. The area under the curve (AUC; concentration of  marker versus time) was calculated according to one- and three-compartment  kinetics. The extrarenal clearance was calculated by dividing the dose of marker  by the AUC. RESULTS: In the three-compartment model, the median of the extrarenal  clearances of iohexol, 51Cr-EDTA, and inulin were 0.87 ml.min-1.10 kg-1 (range =  0.62-1.26 ml.min-1.10 kg-1), 0.79 ml.min-1.10 kg-1 (range = 0.61-1.04 ml.min-1.10  kg-1), and 0.83 ml.min-1.10 kg-1 (range = 0.65-1.17 ml.min-1.10 kg-1). The  extrarenal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA was slightly lower than that of iohexol and  inulin when measured with the three-compartment model (p = .015). There was no  statistically significant difference between the two models of kinetics in  calculating clearance of the same marker. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that  subtracting the median values of the extrarenal clearance of the markers from the  total plasma clearance will provide GFR values closer to the ""true"" GFR. This  technique might prove useful in GFR calculations in patients with a very low GFR  (e.g., residual GFR in patients on dialysis).","1996-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:01:17","","145-153","","2","3","","Acad Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8796655","","","","Animals; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Swine; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Contrast Media/pharmacokinetics; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Iohexol/*pharmacokinetics; *Nephrectomy; Chromium Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics; Edetic Acid/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With increasing dose, nonlinear  kinetics were observed in the tubular secretion, which appeared to show dose and  time dependence. The disposition of nitrofurantoin after intravenous injection is  well described by a one-compartment model with simultaneous first-order nonrenal  elimination and renal elimination, which consists of glomerular filtration,  active tubular secretion conforming to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and  reabsorption clearance by nonionic diffusion. Plasma and urinary excretion data  after intravenous injection of nitrofurantoin were fitted to this model. When the  Michaelis constant was loosely restricted at a constant value, the maximum  velocity decreased with increasing dose of nitrofurantoin. However, the Michaelis  constant apparently increased with increasing dose when the maximum velocity was  loosely restricted at a constant value. Although the results of this fitting  suggested that the former case may occur in the active tubular secretory system,  the latter case could not be completely eliminated because of limited data. The  implications of these results are discussed on the basis of the available  published data.","1985-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:57:43","","165-170","","2","74","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3989686","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rabbits; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Blood Proteins/metabolism; Absorption; Kidney Tubules/*metabolism; Protein Binding/drug effects; Inulin/urine; Nitrofurantoin/blood/*metabolism/urine; Probenecid/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model assumes that the  distribution of 125I-beta-EP is restricted only within the blood and the tissue  interstitial fluid, and that a diffusional barrier across the capillary membrane  exists in each tissue except the liver. The tissue-to-blood partition  coefficients were estimated from the ratios of the concentration in tissues to  that in arterial plasma at the terminal (pseudoequilibrium) phase. The total body  plasma clearance (9.0 ml/min/kg) was appropriately assigned to the liver and  kidney. The transcapillary diffusion clearances of 125I-beta-EP were also  estimated and shown to correlate linearly with that of inulin in several tissues.  Numerically solving the mass-balance differential equations as to plasma and each  tissue simultaneously, simulated concentration curves of 125I-beta-EP  corresponded well with the observed data.

Peak concentration  was achieved within 20 min except for inulin, for which absorption was still  ongoing at 120 min. For YAGFM, the apparent absorption rate was slower than the  elimination rate, thus obeying ""flip-flop"" pharmacokinetics. Based on the area  under the plasma concentration curve from zero to 120 min, the percent of dose  systemically absorbed was 36.1 +/- 4.4% for YAGFM, at least 3.3 +/- 0.2% for  inulin, and 58.5 +/- 4.4% for epinephrine. This suggests that loss of drug to the  systemic circulation is a more important factor in reducing the ocular absorption  of YAGFM than for inulin. The conjunctival mucosa played as important a role as  the nasal mucosa in the systemic absorption of YAGFM, while playing a secondary  role in the case of inulin. Unlike nonpeptide drugs, the systemic absorption of  ocularly administered YAGFM and inulin was not adversely affected by  incorporation in 5% polyvinyl alcohol. Overall, the contact time of the instilled  dose with the conjunctival and the nasal mucosae, their intrinsic permeability,  and the extent of dilution of the instilled dose are key factors determining the  vehicle effects on the extent of systemic absorption of ocularly applied  peptides.","1988-10","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:08","","838-842","","10","77","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3236225","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Intestinal Absorption; Biological Availability; Administration, Intranasal; Pharmaceutical Vehicles; Administration, Topical; Inulin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Conjunctiva; Enkephalin, Methionine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Ophthalmic Solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The simultaneous  dispositions of these markers were characterized in four halothane-anesthetized  dogs. After injection of ICG, [14C]-inulin, and antipyrine into the right atrium,  femoral arterial blood samples were collected every 3 sec for 1 min and less  frequently to 20 min for ICG and to 360 min for inulin and antipyrine.

The marker concentration histories were characterized completely by fully  identifiable recirculatory compartmental models. Because neither ICG nor inulin  distribute beyond intravascular space before recirculation, their first-pass data  were modelled simultaneously to improve confidence in central circulation model  parameters. This central circulation model included an estimate of cardiac output  that was retained in the recirculatory models of all markers. Three tissue  compartments were identified for antipyrine, a lipid soluble marker that  equilibrates with tissue (including the lung) and estimates total body water and  tissue blood flow. The hydrophilic marker, inulin, diffuses into interstitial  fluid so slowly that only two extravascular compartments were identified. These  models may be used to determine how cardiac output and its distribution,  pulmonary drug uptake, and nondistributive blood flow contribute to variability  in patient response to drugs with a rapid onset of effect.","1996-09","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:00:20","","1050-1057","","3","278","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8819485","","","","Animals; Models, Biological; Area Under Curve; Dogs; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; *Antipyrine/pharmacokinetics; *Body Water; *Extracellular Space; *Indocyanine Green/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Probenecid also reduced the renal clearance of  para-aminohippurate and inulin to 67% and 75% of control.

The ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy, defined as the  methylation potential (MP), indicates the flow of methyl groups within the cells.  Chronic elevations of total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma correlate with  increased AdoHcy concentrations, decreased MP, and impaired DNA methylation.  However, the influence of acute hyperhomocysteinemia on MP is unknown. We induced  acute hyperhomocysteinemia in 14 healthy volunteers by oral administration of  l-homocysteine (65.1 micromol/kg body wt) in an open, randomized,  placebo-controlled two-period crossover study. The kinetics of tHcy in blood and  urine, MP in blood, and global DNA methylation in lymphocytes were studied  systematically during 48 h. Plasma tHcy concentrations reached a peak at 34 +/-  11 min after an oral load with l-homocysteine and decreased with a half-life of  257 +/- 41 min (means +/- SD). Only 2.3% of the homocysteine dose were recovered  in urine. AdoHcy concentrations and MP in whole blood and erythrocytes were not  affected by the oral homocysteine load. Furthermore, global DNA methylation in  lymphocytes did not change under these conditions. We found no difference between  the genotypes of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in response to the  homocysteine load. However, AdoMet content in erythrocytes was significantly  higher in the C677T carriers (CT; n = 7) compared with the CC genotype (n = 7).

The plasma clearance of  inulin following administration of an i.m. solution (0.928 +/- 0.173 mL/min/100  gm, n = 9) was in close agreement to the value observed following administration  of an i.v. solution.

METHODS: In conscious mice, a bolus of  [(3)H]methoxy-inulin and [(14)C]para-amino-hippuric (PAH) was injected in the  tail vein whereupon eight blood samples were taken during the following 75min.  Plasma concentrations were determined by liquid scintillation and clearances of  the injected markers were calculated by non-compartmental pharmacokinetic data  analysis of the plasma disappearance curves. In anaesthetized mice, the renal  extraction ratio of PAH was determined by infusion of PAH and subsequent analysis  of blood taken from the carotid artery and the renal vein. The acquired value  (0.70±0.02) was used for all subsequent calculations of RPF. To evaluate the  protocol, a crossover study was performed where either the vehicle or the  angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan was given prior to the  clearance measurements. RESULTS: Baseline values of GFR and RPF were in line with  those earlier reported in mice. Administration of candesartan increased RPF and  reduced the filtration fraction, whereas GFR was unaltered. These changes are  supported by earlier findings and demonstrate that GFR and RPF can be determined  independently. Furthermore, modelling experiments demonstrated that acceptable  results are obtained even if the number of blood samples is reduced to four which  is a way to further simplify the procedure. DISCUSSION: The method provides an  effective way for repeated measurements of GFR and RPF in mice without  potentially confounding effects of anaesthesia.","2013-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","187-193","","3","67","","J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We measured simultaneous  urinary and plasma clearance of iothalamate using high-performance liquid  chromatography in 30 patients with CKD after a continuous subcutaneous infusion  of iothalamate at a rate of 125 microL/h for a 24-hour period. To ascertain  whether a steady state was achieved with a 24-hour infusion, in 20 additional  patients, we infused iothalamate continuously for 48 hours and measured GFR after  24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: Plasma iothalamate levels and urinary excretion rates  obtained after 24- and 48-hour infusions were similar. GFR estimated by plasma  clearance (44.4 mL/min; 95% confidence interval [CI], 37.0 to 53.3) was similar  to urinary clearance (41.6 mL/min; 95% CI, 34.7 to 50.0) and without bias  (average difference, 7%; 95% CI, +18% to -38%; P = 0.866). There also was  acceptable agreement between plasma and urinary clearance of iothalamate  (coefficient of variation [CV], 19.6% between techniques). Reproducibility of  day-to-day plasma continuous infusion clearance technique was less than 12%.  There was good agreement (CV, 19.9%) between inulin and renal iothalamate  clearances. CONCLUSION: These data show that ambulatory infusion of iothalamate  can be used to measure GFR in adults with CKD without the need for urine  collections with acceptable precision and without exposure to radioactivity.","2003-04","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:02:58","","752-759","","4","41","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12666061","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Half-Life; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Aged, 80 and over; Comorbidity; Chronic Disease; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Infusion Pumps, Implantable; Infusions, Parenteral; Ambulatory Care; *Iothalamic Acid/administration & dosage/analysis/pharmacokinetics; Inulin/analysis/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endothelial dysfunction has been closely linked to  reduced activity in the NO system. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential  cofactor of all NO synthase isoforms. METHODS: We examined the effects of BH4 on  the NO system assessed by measurement of serum cGMP levels and NO breakdown  products (NOx) in 12 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Application of a total of 19  mg/kg BH4 intravenously (i.v.) over 3 hours led to a dose-dependent increase in  serum cGMP concentrations from a median 3.3 nM (interquartile range [IQR]  1.1-5.6) to 5.7 nM (IQR 2.4-13.3, p=0.008) and NOx from a median 49.3 microM (IQR  39.8-56.6) to 59.7 microM (39.6-85.5) (p=0.058).

In a second study, oral BH4  given over 3 days (800 mg/day) similarly increased serum cGMP and ameliorated the  depressive effects of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (1.5 mg/kg i.v.) on the  glomerular filtration rate. CONCLUSIONS: Application of BH4 in high doses is safe  and enhances formation of cGMP, pointing to increased bioavailability of NO.","2008-12","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:02:54","","850-860","","6","21","","J Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 19034869","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Reference Values; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Infusions, Intravenous; Nitric Oxide/*metabolism; Biopterin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Cyclic GMP/blood; Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects/physiology; NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Renal Circulation/*drug effects/physiology; Renal Plasma Flow/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endogenous creatinine clearance was computed after  analyzing plasma and urine for creatinine by use of 2 methods, PAP and kinetic  Jaffe. For 20-minute clearance procedures, [14C]inulin clearance was measured  simultaneously with endogenous creatinine clearance. For 111 twenty-minute  clearance procedures performed on 24 dogs, [14C]inulin clearance was highly  correlated with creatinine clearance for both methods of creatinine analysis (R2  = 0.979 for [14C]inulin-PAP; R2 = 0.943 for [14C]inulin-Jaffe). The absolute  values for PAP and [14C]inulin clearance were nearly the same (PAP-to-[14C]inulin  clearance ratio = 1.03 +/- 0.08), but those for Jaffe clearance were  substantially less than those for [14C]inulin clearance (Jaffe-to-[14C]inulin  clearance ratio = 0.88 +/- 0.10). The Jaffe-to-[14C]inulin clearance ratio was  inversely correlated with degree of renal function (R2 = 0.464), whereas the  PAP-to-[14C]inulin clearance ratio was not correlated with degree of renal  function (R2 = 0.060). Thus, Jaffe-determined creatinine clearance varied, in  relation to [14C]inulin clearance, depending on degree of renal function. In 4  clinically normal dogs, 20-minute and 24-hour sample collections analyzed by use  of the PAP method gave clearance values significantly greater, for both periods,  than did Jaffe analyses.

To optimize this procedure in children, we analyzed 117 serum inulin time-decay  curves in 59 children (age range 1.3-15.2 years)with renal disease. It was found  that the two-compartment model fitted statistically better to the disappearance  curves of serum inulin than the one-compartment model. The sampling frequency  could be reduced from 12 to a minimum of seven data points (t=0, 10, 20, 30, 65,  120 and 240 min) in 4 h without a relevant change in the fit of the  two-compartment model to the date or in the calculated clearance of serum inulin.  We conclude that, by using a standardized 'seven-sample schedule', followed by a  two-compartment analysis, the single-injection serum clearance of inulin is a  suitable compromise between practical convenience and clinical accuracy for the  determination of the GFR in children.","2000-01","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:06","","60-66","","","37 ( Pt 1)","","Ann Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10672374","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Clinical Laboratory Techniques/standards; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Inulin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Laboratories, Hospital/standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.","The effect of probenecid on the renal elimination of cimetidine.","Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics","","0009-9236","10.1038/clpt.1989.53","","It is generally assumed that the systems involved in the transport of organic cations and organic anions in the renal proximal tubule are substrate selective  (i.e., organic anions do not inhibit organic cation transport and vice versa).  However, recent data obtained in vitro have suggested that the organic anion  probenecid inhibits the renal transport of the organic cation cimetidine. We  addressed the question of whether this interaction is biologically relevant in  human beings. The study involved a two-treatment, randomized crossover design.  Six healthy male subjects were given an intravenous infusion of 300 mg cimetidine  alone as one treatment and, as the other treatment, received multiple oral doses  of probenecid before receiving the cimetidine infusion. The renal clearance of  cimetidine and inulin was determined in each period. There were no significant  differences between treatments in cimetidine plasma concentrations, apparent  volume of distribution, systemic clearance, half-life, amount of drug excreted  unchanged in the urine, or nonrenal clearance. Probenecid significantly decreased  the renal clearance of cimetidine by decreasing both the filtration clearance and  the net secretory clearance. These effects were most evident in the first 1/2 to  1 hour after cimetidine administration, when probenecid levels in plasma and  renal tissue would have been the highest. Because there was no effect of  probenecid on cimetidine plasma concentrations, this interaction is not  clinically relevant to the therapeutic use of these two compounds. However, the  study demonstrates that renal interactions between organic cations and organic  anions can occur in human beings. The mechanism of this interaction and the  implications to other drug combinations are being explored.","1989-04","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:01:10","","444-452","","4","45","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2702802","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Half-Life; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Probenecid/*pharmacology; Inulin/blood/urine; Cimetidine/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously reported studies have not achieved steady-state conditions with constant vancomycin concentrations. We  measured systemic vancomycin clearance simultaneously with the renal clearances  of vancomycin, creatinine, inulin, and para-aminohippurate in nine healthy  subjects at steady-state serum vancomycin concentrations of 7 and 14 mg/L. For  all steady-state observations the renal clearance of vancomycin was 89 +/- 11  ml/min (mean +/- SE), the clearance of inulin 105 +/- 9 ml/min, the clearance of  creatinine 117 +/- 9 ml/min, and the clearance of para-aminohippuric acid 496 +/-  41 ml/min. The systemic clearance of vancomycin was 131 +/- 7 ml/min. The  clearances of creatinine, inulin, and para-aminohippuric acid and the renal  clearance of vancomycin were not statistically different at both steady-state  vancomycin concentrations. The ratio of the renal clearance of vancomycin to the  clearance of inulin was 0.89 +/- 0.06 and to creatinine clearance 0.79 +/- 0.05.  Both ratios were independent of vancomycin concentration, urine flow rate, and  filtration fraction. The systemic clearance of vancomycin was 10% greater at  serum vancomycin concentrations of 14 mg/L than at 7 mg/L (p less than 0.05)  because of an increase in the nonrenal clearance. Therefore in healthy subjects,  30% of the systemic vancomycin clearance is by nonrenal mechanisms and this  nonrenal clearance is concentration dependent. Assuming protein binding to be  between 10% and 20%, renal vancomycin excretion is predominantly by glomerular  filtration. Small amounts of tubular vancomycin transport cannot be excluded by  these techniques.","1988-05","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:01:07","","565-570","","5","43","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3365918","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Kidney/*metabolism; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Vancomycin/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were  restructured to a common base and reanalyzed using a two-compartment open-system  kinetic model with an outlet from plasma to urinary excretion or from  interstitial fluid to deposition in tissues. This was used to obtain transfer  rates, distribution volumes, renal clearance, tracer content of interstitial  fluid, and cumulative urinary excretion. The validity of the approach was  demonstrated by good agreement of the calculated distribution volumes and renal  clearances of the selected tracers with published values obtained by other  analytical methods. The values of the parameters of the plasma curves and the  transfer rates for EDTA and DTPA in the animals were combined with physiological  data to evaluate the kinetic parameters of those substances in man. The human  kinetic parameters of the ligands predicted from rat or dog data differed, on the  average, from the values calculated from human data by +/- 13 and +/- 38%,  respectively. The effective concentration of EDTA or DTPA in body fluids from  time of injection to complete excretion and the mean concentration for the first  360 min after injection was calculated to be about four times greater in man than  in rats and 3.5 times greater than in dogs for equimolar amounts injected. Based  on the pharmacokinetics of DTPA, chelation therapy immediately after an actinide  accident involving inhalation or extensive skin damage will be more efficient and  more effective if a fraction of the standard clinical ZnNa3-DTPA dosage is  administered every few hours instead of as a single daily injection.","1989","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","165-173; discussion 174","","","57 Suppl 1","","Health Phys","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2514156","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Models, Biological; Species Specificity; Dogs; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Chelating Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Pentetic Acid/pharmacokinetics; Bromine Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics; Edetic Acid/pharmacokinetics; Sodium Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study included two  groups of animals. The first group involved two subgroups, both receiving an  infusion of 0.9% NaCl-5% glucose (50-50, v:v) at the rate of 24 ml/hr to  adequately hydrate the rabbits, but one received 2.5 ng/min/kg of AVP with the  infusion; 120 min later, a bolus of inulin was injected to assess the  distribution in the extracellular water. The rabbits of the second group were  divided into 3 subgroups, receiving a 0.9% NaCl-5% glucose (50-50, v:v) infusion,  at the rate of 6 ml/min; two subgroups received AVP, at the rate of 2.5 or 5  ng/min/kg; 40 minutes later, all animals received a bolus of inulin. In  adequately hydrated rabbits, the infusion of AVP generated plasma levels of 35  +/- 7 pg/ml; the VE decreased from 204 +/- 23 to 111 +/- 10 ml/kg (p < 0.01)  because of a decrease in plasma (VP) and interstitial volumes (VI). In the same  group, natriuresis and osmolal clearance increased and free water clearance  decreased. In rabbits deficiently hydrated, AVP reached plasma levels of 47 +/-  18 and 86 +/- 12 pg/ml following the 2.5 and 5 ng/min/kg infusions, respectively.  In these animals, high plasma levels of AVP did not diminish VE but decreased the  diuresis and osmolal clearance. It is concluded that in adequately hydrated  rabbits, pathophysiological plasma levels of AVP shift the water from the VE to  the intracellular space and increase the natriuresis, but in partially hydrated  rabbits, the infusion of AVP maintains plasma volume constant because of an  antidiuretic effect.","1993-05","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:02:51","","131-141","","2","80","","Res Commun Chem Pathol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8321918","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Infusions, Intravenous; Osmolar Concentration; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Dehydration/*metabolism; Sodium/metabolism; Water-Electrolyte Balance/drug effects; Arginine Vasopressin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systemic vascular  resistance was more than doubled by phenylephrine and was decreased more than 50%  by both isoproterenol and nitroprusside. Dye (ICG) dilution cardiac output (CO)  was decreased nearly one-third by phenylephrine, was more than doubled by  isoproterenol, and was largely unaffected by nitroprusside. Although  phenylephrine reduced CO, the fraction of CO represented by nondistributive blood  flow nearly doubled at the expense of blood flow to rapidly equilibrating  tissues. The area under the blood antipyrine concentration versus time  relationship for 3 min after administration (AUC(0-3 min)) during the  phenylephrine infusion was nearly 75% larger than control due to both increased  first-pass AUC and an increased fraction of CO represented by nondistributive  blood flow. The large increase in CO produced by isoproterenol increased blood  flow to rapidly equilibrating tissues and relatively decreased blood flow to  slowly equilibrating tissues, because some appeared to equilibrate rapidly.  Antipyrine AUC(0-3 min) during the isoproterenol infusion decreased more than  30%, due to decreased first-pass AUC. Nitroprusside changed antipyrine  intercompartmental clearances in proportion to CO and, hence, had little effect  on antipyrine AUC(0-3 min). These data provide further evidence that changes in  antipyrine (a lipophilic drug surrogate) blood flow-dependent distribution after  rapid i.v. administration are not proportional to changes in CO but depend on  both CO and its distribution.","2001-03","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:00:19","","922-930","","3","296","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11181925","","","","Male; Animals; Area Under Curve; Dogs; Antipyrine/blood; Biomarkers/blood; Hemodynamics; Regional Blood Flow; Carbon Monoxide/metabolism; Indocyanine Green/metabolism; Inulin/blood; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Adrenergic beta-Agonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Blood Volume/drug effects; Body Water/*drug effects; Extracellular Space/*drug effects; Isoproterenol/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Phenylephrine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study has investigated the effects of LPS on the  pharmacokinetics and renal handling of famotidine, an organic cation drug  excreted primarily by an active tubular secretion mechanism in rats. The role of  adenosine in the LPS-induced renal failure was also investigated using  theophylline, an adenosine antagonist. Pretreatment with LPS (250 micrograms/kg)  significantly decreased the steady-state volume of distribution, systemic  clearance, and renal clearance (CLr) of famotidine, but not nonrenal clearance.  No significant differences in total urinary recovery of unchanged famotidine were  observed between treatments. Pretreatment with LPS significantly decreased the  glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated as inulin clearance. LPS increased  the clearance ratio of famotidine (CLr/GFR), but not the net tubular secretion,  indicating that LPS has little or no effect on the active tubular cation  secretory system. Theophylline (10 mg/kg) improved LPS-induced decrease in GFR  without causing any changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of famotidine.  These findings provide further evidence that LPS produces different effects on  the distribution and the active tubular secretory systems of anion and cation  drugs, and that adenosine may play an important role in the induction of renal  failure by LPS.","1994-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","8-13","","1","22","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8149895","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Rats, Wistar; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/metabolism; Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology; Theophylline/*pharmacology; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Famotidine/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rabbit  serum was activated with inulin in vitro to generate SC5b-9, and the activated  serum was applied intravenously in normal and C6-deficient rabbits. Elimination  of SC5b-9 in normal rabbits was rapid, half-life in the range of 30-50 min. No  differences were noted between the clearance of homologous rabbit and  heterologous human SC5b-9, SC5b-9 concentrations returned to basal levels 2-3 h  after application. Plasma of C6-deficient rabbits contained no SC5b-9 and these  animals displayed an even more effective clearance capacity for the complex.  Quantitative considerations indicated that basal plasma SC5b-9 levels in healthy  animals result from a spontaneous turnover rate of approximately 0.2% of C5-C9  components per h. When multiple doses of SC5b-9 were injected in sequence, the  same half-life and total elimination time were found as with single-dose  experiments. The results demonstrate the existence of an effective clearance  mechanism for SC5b-9, consistent with recent findings that SC5b-9 plasma levels  are very low not only in healthy adults, but also in the majority of patients  with complement-consuming diseases.","1989-07","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:00:42","","112-116","","1","77","","Clin Exp Immunol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2766574  PMCID: PMC1541916","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Half-Life; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Complement System Proteins/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the rats were  subdivided into groups according to their level of renal function (Cin greater  than 1.5 mL/min; Cin 0.5 to 1.49 mL/min; Cin 0.02 to 0.49 mL/min), excellent  correlations between Cin and Ccr were still observed (r = .93, .97, and .97,  respectively). We concluded that exogenous Ccr accurately reflects GFR in the rat  over the entire range of renal function and in a wide variety of experimental  nephropathies. Given the simple methodology, exogenous Ccr could have substantial  research application for assessing degrees of excretory function in experimental  renal disease.","1987-12","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","427-430","","6","10","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3687935","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Nephrectomy; Inulin/metabolism; *Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Creatinine/*metabolism; Kidney Diseases/*physiopathology/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tc-99m-DTPA is distributed in the  extracellular space in the same way as inulin.

The continuous measurement of  pulse rates and the use of a UFR-controller (A2008) allow an exact tracking of CP  vs. time, the estimation of CP (QB), CP(UFR) and of the sieving coefficient.

Plasma clearance of nonradioactive  iodine contrast media (i.e., iohexol or iopromide) has been suggested as a  reliable alternative to the renal clearance of inulin for estimating glomerular  filtration rate (GFR). The accuracy of this method when used with critically ill  patients displaying different levels of renal function in an intensive care unit  (ICU) has not, until now, been examined. DESIGN: The accuracy of double- and  multiple-point iohexol or iopromide plasma clearances was compared with that of  already established techniques for measuring GFR (creatinine clearance, formula  clearance by Cockcroft and Gault) and with that of inulin clearance, which is  regarded as the gold standard for the measurement of GFR. PATIENTS: Values were  obtained from 31 ICU patients who exhibited a wide range of renal function (serum  creatinine: 0.6-6.7 mg/dL). MEASUREMENTS: Inulin clearance was performed using  the constant-infusion technique. Creatinine clearance was determined from 24-hr  urine samples. The clearance formula was calculated according to Cockcroft and  Gault's formula. Iohexol or iopromide were applied as a single intravenous dose,  and blood samples were taken up to 6 hrs after the injection. Iodine  concentrations were determined by radiographic fluorescence. RESULTS: Plasma  clearance of iohexol/iopromide measured after the single injection of contrast  media and that of the conventional inulin clearance was almost identical (y =  0.971x + 7.65, r2 =.96; n = 31). Two-point clearance of iohexol/iopromide (double  sampling technique) was as reliable as the three-point clearance  (three-slope-intercept method, y = 0.995x + 0.62, r2 =.999; n = 18). With respect  to inulin clearance, GFR measurements determined by creatinine clearance or  according to the formula given by Cockcroft and Gault revealed errors that  increased proportionally (y = 1.03x, r2 =.88; n = 27; and y = 0.93x, r2 =.62; n =  31, respectively). It could also be shown that the accuracy of GFR measurements  involving plasma clearance of iohexol was not greatly affected by the degree of  renal insufficiency or the route by which contrast media were applied.  CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the determination of plasma clearance of  iohexol/iopromide is a simple, rapid, and accurate method that can indeed be used  for estimating GFR in ICU patients with normal renal function or even different  degrees of renal insufficiency.","2001-08","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:01:38","","1544-1550","","8","29","","Crit Care Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11505124","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Linear Models; Intensive Care Units; Creatinine/*urine; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Contrast Media/*pharmacokinetics; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Iohexol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed at elucidation of the  mechanism by which AAT isozymes are cleared from blood. Intravenous injection  into rats of m-AAT and c-AAT purified from rat liver exhibited a biphasic  clearance curve with an overall half-life of 42 min and 4.7 hr, respectively. The  tissue distribution of the radioactivity following intravenous administration of  125I-labeled isozymes revealed that the liver is a major organ involved in plasma  clearance of these isozymes. This conclusion was also supported by the  significant retardation in plasma clearance of m-AAT in hepatectomized as well as  CCl4-intoxicated rats. Furthermore, clearance rate of each AAT isozyme in an  isolated perfused liver exhibited a single exponential process with the uptake  rate for m-AAT being much faster than that for c-AAT. Separation of hepatocytes  and sinusoidal liver cells from the rat intravenously injected with 125I-labeled  AAT isozymes revealed that sinusoidal cells were responsible for the plasma  clearances. In vitro uptake study showed that both isozymes were exclusively  taken up by sinusoidal liver cells. The uptake rate for m-AAT was considerably  greater than that for c-AAT. Endocytotic index for uptake by sinusoidal cells was  16 times with c-AAT and 34 times with m-AAT as compared with that for inulin or  dextran which are taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis, suggesting involvement of  adsorptive endocytosis in the uptake of the isozymes.","1985-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","367-375","","3","5","","Hepatology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3997068","","","","Male; Animals; Hepatectomy; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Injections, Intravenous; Tissue Distribution; Liver/*metabolism; Mitochondria, Liver/enzymology; Endocytosis; Aspartate Aminotransferases/administration & dosage/*metabolism; Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning/blood; Cytosol/enzymology; Isoenzymes/administration & dosage/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reductions of CDIG and CDIG/CIN were  observed immediately after the spironolactone loading infusion and were  associated with a sudden rise in plasma digoxin. The changes in digoxin handling  with spironolactone appeared to be temporally dissociated from the  antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone.

However, the relative importance of the kidneys in clearance of rFVIIa has not  previously been addressed. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the  importance of the kidneys in the clearance process of rFVIIa after iv  administration to rats using a nephrectomy model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  nephrectomized rat model was established and validated using inulin, a compound  primarily cleared by the kidneys, as a test substance and several physiological  parameters were monitored to ensure viability and robustness of the model. The  model was then used for pharmacokinetic evaluation of renal clearance of rFVIIa.  The pharmacokinetic parameters for rFVIIa were evaluated both by use of standard  non-compartmental methods and by use of mixed effects methods, where a  pharmacokinetic model was used to simultaneously model all data from healthy,  sham operated, and nephrectomized rats. RESULTS: Nephrectomized animals showed  stable rectal temperature, SpO2 and pulse and as expected, clearance of inulin  was essentially abolished compared to control animals (p<0.001). For rFVIIa,  nephrectomy resulted in a clearance and terminal half-life of 34mL/h/kg and 2.8h  compared to 68mL/h/kg and1.9h in rats exposed to sham surgery (p<0.0001 for both  parameters). CONCLUSION: The present data show that about 50% of the total  clearance of rFVIIa from circulation in rats under isoflurane anaesthesia is due  to renal clearance.","2014-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","1124-1129","","6","133","","Thromb Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Under normal physiological  conditions the half-time of the major rapid component of the plasma elimination  curve was estimated at 6.0 +/- 0.5 min, the volume of distribution at 35.7 +/-  3.3 ml kg-1, i.e. the plasma volume and the corresponding plasma clearance at 4  ml min-1 kg-1. After a single intravenous dose, most of the enzyme was  distributed to and eliminated by the two kidneys, whereas the non-renal clearance  was low, 0.5 ml min-1 kg-1. The single nephron filtration of SOD, as assessed  from micropuncture of Bowman's space, was 10.4 +/- 1.0 nl min-1, which was 26 +/-  2% of that for inulin. The total elimination of SOD by glomerular filtration  would thereby be 2.5 ml min-1 kg-1, i.e. the glomerular ultrafiltration process  would account for the largest part of the elimination of SOD from circulating  plasma. After the dosage of 20 mg kg-1, about two-thirds of the injected SOD was  excreted as the intact molecule into the urine, whereas one-third was found to be  reabsorbed and metabolized by the proximal tubular epithelial cells. In animals  suffering from unilateral post-ischaemic acute renal failure, the elimination  half-time was 13 +/- 1.9 min, a value which increased by 55 +/- 5 min after  bilateral functional nephrectomy. By contrast, the distribution volume remained  essentially unchanged.","1988-09","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","65-74","","1","134","","Acta Physiol Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3239424","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Kidney/*metabolism; Molecular Weight; Nephrectomy; Chromatography, Gel; Acute Kidney Injury/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Superoxide Dismutase/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methotrexate is in man renaly  excreted in combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular drug  transport (in a proximal tubule). After intravenous MTX administration, more than  95% of the amount of delivered dose was detected in urine in the form of intact  MTX. To compare glomerular filtration and other ways of renal MTX excretion, the  ratio between MTX clearance and clearance of inuline (which evaluate the rate of  glomerular filtration only) was calculated and analyzed. Renal clearance of MTX  was higher than that of inuline (Cl/Cl = 1.50 (0.095 ml/min.kg). The results  showed a significant correlation between Cl and pH of urine (r = 0.525, r =  0.7243, p < 0.001, figure 1). Similar correlations were found when comparing the  results of Cl and glomerular filtration (r = 0.8589, r = 0.8939, p < 0.00001)  (figure 2). Significant relationship was also evident between Cl and urine pH and  GF together (simultaneously) (r = 0.8677). The renal clearance of MTX varied from  1.36 ml/min.kg (measured at pH 6.0) to 3.2 ml/min.kg (measured at pH 7.0).

A relatively constant  level of 3HMTX was reached in plasma 2 1/2 hours after injection, and about 30%  of the 3HMTX dose was excreted in the urine within 4 hours after injection.  Maximum levels in CNS tissues were obtained by 4 hours after injection, and  average concentrations of 10(-6) M MTX (moles/kg wet weight) were maintained in  CSF for up to 12 hours and in brain for up to 24 hours after injection.  Conversion of MTX to non-MTX products was detected in CSF between 4 and 12 hours,  and in brain tissue between 12 and 24 hours after injection, and the amount of  these products increased with time. Regional distribution studies in the cerebrum  showed a U-shaped distribution curve for 3HMTX up to 12 hours after injection,  which closely followed the 14C inulin distribution. Thus, the levels in deep  cerebral tissue were less than the average level for brain, and this suggests  that treatment of CNS tumors by intraventricular injection may have variable  results, partly due to complex tissue distribution patterns.","1978-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:00:25","","883-894","","6","48","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 96228","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Tissue Distribution; Brain/metabolism; Macaca fascicularis; Haplorhini; Injections, Intraventricular; Ependyma/metabolism; Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biokinetic studies of the new ligands,  CaNa3-DTPA, and Pu(IV) are major components of those investigations. Young adult  female mice were injected intravenously (iv) with 3H-inulin, 14C-CaNa3-DTPA, or  238Pu(IV) citrate to provide baseline data for plasma clearance, tissue uptake,  and excretion rates and to determine the dilution volume (VOD) and renal  clearance rate (RC) of filterable substances. Published plasma clearance data for  iv-injected 14C-CaNa3-DTPA and Pu(IV) citrate in Reference Man, dog, and rat were  collected. Based on combined data for 3H-inulin and 14C-CaNa3-DTPA, VOD = 17% of  body weight and RC = 18 mL kg(-1) min(-1) for mice. Retention of 14C-CaNa3-DTPA  in the four species is proportional to body weight and inversely proportional to  RC: Integrals of the retention of 14C-CaNa3-DTPA from R(t) = 1.0 to R(t) = 0.05  are 108, 43, 28, and 10 DF min, respectively, for Reference Man, dog, rat, and  mouse. Clearances of iv-injected Pu(IV) citrate from plasma are in the same  order: The plasma curve integrals from injection to 1440 min are 840, 640, 280,  and 67 DF min, respectively, for Reference Man, dog, rat, and mouse. In mice, a  large fraction of newly injected Pu(IV) is rapidly transferred to the  interstitial water of bulk soft tissue (excluding liver and kidneys), from which  it is cleared at the same rate as from the plasma. Rapid plasma clearance, escape  into interstitial water (22%ID at 20 min), significant early urinary excretion  (8%ID in 12 h), and prompt deposition in liver and skeleton (complete in 12 h)  are evidence of inefficient binding to plasma protein (mainly transferrin) of  newly injected Pu(IV) in mice. Conversely, slow plasma clearance, little early  urinary excretion, and delayed deposition in liver and skeleton reflect more  efficient binding by transferrin of newly injected Pu(IV) in Reference Man and  dog. Pharmacokinetic parameters (effective dosage, effective concentration) of  CaNa3-DTPA, alone or combined with plasma Pu(IV) integrals, yielded only  qualitative predictions of the relative efficacies of CaNa3-DTPA therapy in four  species. The need for improved models of Pu(IV) and ligand biokinetics and the  suitability of the three animals for predicting chelation therapy outcomes in  humans are discussed.","1997-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","222-235","","2","72","","Health Phys","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9003707","","","","Humans; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Mice; Models, Biological; Species Specificity; Injections, Intravenous; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Dogs; Tissue Distribution; Liver/metabolism; Kidney/metabolism; Carbon Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics; Citric Acid/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Pentetic Acid/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Plutonium/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PTZ was  eliminated with the apparent elimination half-life of 13.0 min after  microinjection into the parietal cortex area 2 region of the rat brain. The  apparent efflux clearance of PTZ across the BBB was 137 microl/min/g brain, which  was calculated from the elimination rate constant (5.35 x 10(-2) min(-1) and the  distribution volume in the brain (2.56 ml/g brain). The efflux transport of PTZ  was decreased in the presence of unlabeled PTZ, suggesting that PTZ is eliminated  by a carrier-mediated transport system across the BBB. To characterize the efflux  transport of PTZ from the brain in vivo, the effects of several compounds on the  efflux transport of PTZ were investigated. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors  (verapamil and quinidine) reduced the PTZ efflux transport. In addition, the  efflux transport of PTZ was inhibited by organic cations such as l-carnitine and  tetraethylammonium (TEA), whereas organic anions such as p-aminohippuric acid,  probenecid and taurocholate did not affect the PTZ efflux transport.

During cimetidine administration the  creatinine/inulin clearance ratio approaches unity in patients with renal  failure. We determined the clearance of lithium (an index of fluid delivery to  the distal nephron), inulin (a measure of the actual GFR) and creatinine during  cimetidine administration to investigate the occurrence of tubular creatinine  secretion in patients with compensated cirrhosis. A total of 12 patients with  Child-Pugh A cirrhosis were studied initially. The subjects consumed a stable  diet containing 100 mmol of sodium. On successive days, 9 h creatinine clearances  were measured, first without and then with the oral administration of cimetidine  (400 mg as a priming dose, followed by 200 mg every 3 h). During the first study  day, 4 h renal lithium clearance was also calculated. A further group of five  patients with fully compensated cirrhosis underwent the measurement (on  successive days) of plasma inulin clearance, first without and then with the oral  administration of cimetidine (same schedule of drug administration). Cimetidine  administration unmasked a marked overestimation of GFR when calculated as  creatinine clearance (baseline, 138+/-20 ml/min; +cimetidine, 89+/-13 ml/min;  P<0.01). Consequently, during cimetidine administration the calculated lithium  fractional excretion (a measure of the fraction of filtered sodium load that is  delivered to the loop of Henle) rose from 21.4+/-13.2% to 32.3+/-18.9% (P<0.05),  and the ratio between absolute distal tubular sodium reabsorption and filtered  sodium load rose from 20.6+/-13.1% to 31.6+/-19.3% (P<0.01). Cimetidine caused no  significant decrease in the actual GFR (i.e. inulin clearance) when administered  to the second group of patients with compensated cirrhosis. Our data demonstrate  significant tubular secretion of creatinine in patients with compensated  cirrhosis and, consequently, a marked overestimation of GFR and filtered sodium  load and an underestimation of the fractional distal tubular sodium reabsorption  when these parameters are calculated by means of the traditional creatinine and  lithium clearance computation.

Due to its very large distribution volume (10 L/kg),  only less than 1% of the body load is available for removal, making hemodialysis  and hemoperfusion ineffective. Until recently it was assumed that most of the  body load of digoxin is eliminated by glomerular filtration. It is now evident  that substantial tubular reabsorption and secretion take place. As for the other  drugs which are reabsorbed by the tubule (eg Aspirin), we wished to assess  whether urine flow rate affect digoxin renal clearance. We studied anesthetized,  ventilated dogs. They were preloaded with 25 micrograms/kg IV digoxin the day  prior to the experiment. The dogs were infused initially with saline and after a  urine collection for digoxin renal clearance 200 ml 10% mannitol were infused  over 30 minutes. Digoxin renal clearance was increased 2-3 folds in all cases  with a small increase in inulin clearance. Based on these results, the ability of  mannitol diuresis to remove significant systemic amounts of digoxin should be  tested in acute toxicity in animals. This may be an adjunct modality to FAB  antibodies and activated charcoal.","1988-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:00:22","","25-27","","1","30","","Vet Hum Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3127989","","","","Animals; Dogs; Creatinine/urine; Digoxin/*pharmacokinetics; Inulin; Diuresis/*drug effects; Mannitol/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During a 3-hr period of water deprivation, the rats  lost water in amounts corresponding to about 10% of body weight. Lithium  clearance fell to about 25% of the level observed in rats which were not water  deprived. During shorter periods of water deprivation, the fall of lithium  clearance was less. The decrease of lithium clearance was partly due to a fall of  inulin clearance and partly due to a fall of fractional excretion of lithium. The  decrease of the two variables contributed to the same extent to the decrease of  lithium clearance. The findings support the suggestion that insufficient intake  of water in patients with lithium-induced polyuria may lead to a rapid lowering  of lithium clearance and, hence, to a rise of the serum lithium concentration and  development of intoxication.","1979-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","327-329","","3","209","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 439008","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Osmolar Concentration; Diet, Sodium-Restricted; *Water Deprivation; Inulin; Lithium/*metabolism/pharmacology/urine; Polyuria/chemically induced/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The brain efflux index value is defined as the relative  amount of test drug effluxed from cerebrum compared with that of a reference  compound, [14C]carboxylinulin, which has limited blood-brain barrier  permeability. Microinjection of 0.2, 0.5 or 1.0 microliter into the parietal  cortex area 2 region was found to be an appropriate procedure for obtaining a  high recovery and for restricting the test drug and reference compound to the  ipsilateral cerebrum. No significant increase in influx clearance of  [14C]carboxylinulin into the brain was observed for the ipsilateral cerebrum  after the sham microinjection compared with the contralateral cerebrum, which  demonstrated that only limited physical damage is caused. Microinjection of  [3H]H2O into the cerebrum devoid of cerebral blood flow yielded no elimination  from the brain. Analysis based on a pharmacokinetic model demonstrated that the  elimination of a highly permeable compound [3H]H2O from the brain was governed by  cerebral blood flow. The apparent elimination rate constant (Kel) of  [3H]3-O-methyl-D-glucose from the brain was determined as 0.129 +/- 0.014 (min-1)  and was reduced significantly by a preinjection of excess cold  3-O-methyl-D-glucose and phloridzin, whereas no significant elimination was  observed for L[3H]glucose. The efflux clearance of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose was  calculated from the Kel value and the compound's distribution volume, the value  being close to that of the influx clearance. These results demonstrate that the  brain efflux index method is a useful technique for analyzing an efflux process  from the brain across the blood-brain barrier involving a carrier-mediated  transport system.","1996-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","1550-1559","","3","277","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8667222","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Brain/*metabolism; Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiology; Microinjections; Inulin/*metabolism; Mannitol/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore the  effect of FK-506 0.1 to 0.8 mg per kg per day was investigated in rats using  clearance methods including lithium clearance. In rats given FK-506 or placebo  during 1 week the nephrotoxicity of FK-506 was characterized by a slight  reduction of inulin clearance. The end proximal delivery as measured by the  lithium clearance was decreased by FK-506. In rats treated for 4 weeks with  FK-506 0.8 mg/kg/day the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) had decreased to 23% of  the GFR found in controls (P < 0.001), while end proximal delivery was only 8% of  normal. Renal histopathological investigation showed a slight but statistically  significant increase of tubular basophilia and atrophy in FK-506-treated rats.  Skin transplantation studies in the same rat strain showed a dose-dependent  immunosuppressive effect of FK-506. FK-506 0.8 mg/kg was significantly more  immunosuppressive than 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg, so it was concluded that the lower doses  of FK-506 did not fully exploit the drug's immunosuppressive potential. Thus in a  dosage inside the therapeutic range defined from skin transplantations, FK-506  generated a number of toxic effects including a considerable nephrotoxic effect.  The FK-506 induced changes in glomerular and tubular function was a close match  to the changes found in cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity. The present study suggests  that FK-506 nephrotoxicity is caused by constriction of preglomerular vessels.","1995","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","334-340","","3","10","","Nephrol Dial Transplant","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 7540737","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Rats, Inbred Lew; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Body Weight/drug effects; Eating/drug effects; Graft Rejection/prevention & control; Urination/drug effects; Drinking/drug effects; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Kidney Glomerulus/drug effects/physiology; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/drug effects/physiology; Kidney/*drug effects/pathology/physiology; Skin Transplantation/pathology; Tacrolimus/therapeutic use/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plasma clearances in BALB/c mice are  similar among the five RNases studied: human pancreatic RNase, angiogenin,  eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, onconase, and bovine seminal RNase. The average  clearance is 0.13 ml/min or 60% of the glomerular filtration rate (measured by  [14C]inulin clearance during continuous infusion from an i.p. implanted osmotic  pump). Angiogenin has a higher volume of distribution and plasma-to-muscle  transport rate than the other RNases, suggestive of binding to endothelial cells.  Organ distribution differs dramatically among these RNases. The RNase most toxic  to tumor cells, onconase, exhibits the longest retention in the kidneys: at 180  min, 50% of the injected dose is found in the kidneys, whereas only 1% or less of  the other RNases is retained in the kidneys. Slower elimination of onconase from  the kidneys may be due to a higher degree of binding in the kidney or a  resistance to proteolytic degradation. To elucidate the molecular determinants  involved in tissue uptake, we examined the biodistribution of recombinant  onconase and two onconasepancreatic RNase chimeric proteins. The tissue retention  property of onconase appears to be located in at least two regions, one of which  is in the NH2-terminal 9-amino acid alpha-helix. The NH2-terminal pyroglutamate  of onconase, a residue essential for ribonucleolytic activity and cytotoxicity,  does not play a role in kidney retention.","1996-09-15","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","4180-4186","","18","56","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8797589","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Animals; Time Factors; Mice; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Tissue Distribution; Cattle; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Infusions, Parenteral; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Ovum/enzymology; Proteins/pharmacokinetics; Rana pipiens; Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/blood/isolation & purification/*pharmacokinetics; Ribonucleases/blood/isolation & purification/*pharmacokinetics; Semen/enzymology; Seminal Vesicles/enzymology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiments were performed on anesthetized  animals divided into normal weight piglets and intrauterine growth restricted  (IUGR) piglets according to birth weights. The ""normal weight"" category included  animals with a birth weight > 40th percentile (piglets heavier than 1220 g); the  IUGR category included animals with a birth weight > 5th and < 10th percentiles  (piglets with a birthweight between 733 g and 853 g). This animal model of  naturally occurring growth restriction in swine gives asymmetric growth with an  increase in the mean ratio of brain weight to liver weight from 1.02 to 2.02 (p <  0.01). There was only a small reduction in brain weight (11%). In contrast, the  reduction in weight of liver (55%) and kidney (41%) was proportional to that in  body weight (48%). Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases, pH  and RPF were similar in normal weight and IUGR piglets. However inulin clearance  and creatinine clearance were significantly lower in the growth restricted  piglets (p < 0.01). Severe hypoxia induced a moderate tachycardia, combined with  pronounced metabolic acidosis and strongly reduced renal plasma flow and renal  excretory function in both groups (p < 0.05). Comparison between inulin and  creatinine clearances in normal weight and IUGR piglets revealed a markedly  higher clearance of creatinine as of inulin at every experimental stages (p <  0.05, p < 0.01). Alterations of renal excretion due to severe hypoxia and early  recovery were similar in both animal groups investigated. Regression analysis  rendered a linear correlation between inulin clearance and creatinine clearance  among the experimental stages for normal weight as well as IUGR piglets (p <  0.001). Thus, endogenous creatinine clearance is suggested to be a reliable  indicator for renal excretory function in newborn piglets. It accurately reflects  proportional effects of long-term alterations of renal function due to  intrauterine growth restriction as well as acute effects of severe oxygen  deprivation. However, using standard methods of plasma and urine creatinine  measurement, quantitative determination of GFR by endogenous creatinine clearance  is not possible.","2000-08","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:02:46","","367-372","","4","52","","Exp Toxicol Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 10987193","","","","Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Sensitivity and Specificity; Swine; Hypoxia; Biomarkers/analysis; Birth Weight; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Animals, Newborn; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics; Fetal Growth Retardation/*physiopathology/veterinary; Kidney Diseases/etiology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pn was recirculated at initial  concentrations varying from 100 to 1000 ng/ml for 90 min. Perfusate and urine  samples were assayed for Pn and prednisone by HPLC. Protein binding of Pn was  measured by using 3H-Pn and equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C. There were no  significant differences in perfusate flow, glomerular filtration rate, urine  flow, or sodium excretion between control and steroid experiments. Partial  metabolism of Pn to prednisone occurred in all studies. The total kidney  clearance (CIT) of Pn ranged from 0.39 to 1.24 ml/min/100 g of rat body weight  with approximately half of the Pn dose unaccountable for as either Pn or  prednisone. The apparent percentage of the Pn dose excreted unchanged in the  urine ranged from 1.9 to 6.4% and was not related to Pn dose. The apparent  urinary clearances of Pn and its metabolite, prednisone, normalized for inulin  clearance (fractional excretion) were variable with means of 0.068 and 0.095,  respectively. The fractional excretions of Pn and prednisone were related to the  fraction of filtered water excreted but not to perfusate concentration. Thus, the  extent of urinary clearance of these corticosteroids is related to glomerular  filtration and passive tubular reabsorption. The perfused rat kidney reflects the  urinary and renal metabolic clearance of Pn without the complication of  dose-dependent disposition.","1981-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","177-182","","3","9","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6113924","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Perfusion; Protein Binding; Biotransformation; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Kidney/*metabolism; Prednisolone/*metabolism/urine; Prednisone/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In group I the saline load caused an increase in urine flow (+92%),  solute excretion (+67%), inulin clearance (CIN) (+24%), PAH clearance (+31%) and  absolute proximal reabsorption rate (+27%). Proximal fractional reabsorption and  filtration fraction (FF) remained unchanged, while plasma oncotic pressure (COP)  decreased by 10%. Plasma renin fell and there was an inverse relationship between  renin concentration and proximal reabsorption rate. In group II urine flow and  solute excretion increased after saline (+85% and 110%, respectively); CIN and  absolute proximal reabsorption rate was lower than in group I and failed to  increase after saline. Proximal fractional reabsorption was also lower and  decreased after saline. COP as well as renin decreased as in group I, but no  relationship between renin concentration and proximal reabsorption rate could be  demonstrated. The data indicate that Inactin depresses both resting proximal  tubular reabsorptive capacity and the tubular response to a physiological volume  expansion. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the  renin-angiotensin system is significantly involved in regulation of proximal  tubular function, while they are incompatible with the idea that peritubular COP  plays any major role in this adjustment.","1975-08","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","472-483","","4","94","","Acta Physiol Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1180088","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Stimulation, Chemical; Natriuresis/drug effects; Depression, Chemical; Kidney/*drug effects; Renin/blood; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Osmotic Pressure; Inulin/metabolism; Diuresis/drug effects; Isotonic Solutions; Kidney Tubules/*drug effects; Sodium Chloride/*pharmacology; Aminohippuric Acids/metabolism; Amobarbital/*pharmacology; Thiobarbiturates/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  model is based on simultaneously measured disposition curves of drug and vascular  marker. Employing residence time distribution theory, a recirculatory model with  two subsystems, the pulmonary and systemic circulation, was constructed. In  addition to intravascular mixing, the axially distributed model of the systemic  circulation accounts for transcapillary transport of solutes, quantified by  permeability-surface area product (PS) and diffusional equilibration time.  Parameters of ICG, inulin, and antipyrine were estimated from disposition data  obtained in awake dogs under control conditions and during an isoproterenol  infusion or moderate hypovolemia. Results suggest that distribution kinetics is  (1) governed by extravascular diffusion and (2) its dependency on cardiac output  decreases with increasing diffusional resistance. Hemorrhage decreased the  effective PS of inulin. In conclusion, this novel mechanistic model effectively  described both the permeability-limited distribution of inulin into interstitial  fluid and the flow-limited distribution of antipyrine into total body water and  might be useful for other drugs.","2007-04","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:57:41","","913-926","","4","96","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17221855","","","","Animals; Models, Biological; Dogs; Biological Transport; Antipyrine/*pharmacokinetics; Cardiac Output; Diffusion; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; *Capillary Permeability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The best way to measure it in clinical practice has  not been established. Ten stable CAPD patients with residual renal function were  investigated to compare the GFR measured as inulin clearance (Cli) with the  creatinine clearance (Clc), the urea clearance (Clu), and with 0.5(Clc + Clu).  Thereafter, an analysis of whether the administration of cimetidine could improve  the accuracy of these clearances was performed. Two clearance periods (CP) of 24  h were investigated. During CP-2, patients received 400 mg cimetidine twice  daily, for a total dose of 1200 mg. Two h before the urine and dialysate  collection period, inulin was administered iv. Calculations were done for each CP  for Cli, Clc, Clu, Clc-Cli, the Clc/Cli ratio, and the tubular secretion of  creatinine (TSc). No differences between CP-1 and CP-2 were present for urinary  excretion of volume and solutes, and clearance rates of inulin and urea. The  median TSc decreased from 0.71 mumol/min (range, -0.24 to 5.90) in CP-1 to 0.30  mumol/min (range, -0.18 to 0.64) in CP-2 (P < 0.05). Therefore, the median ratio  of Clc/Cli decreased from 1.23 (range, 0.87 to 2.20) in CP-1 to 1.11 (range, 0.95  to 1.51) in CP-2 (P < 0.05). The median overestimation of the Cli in CP-1 by the  Clc was 0.90 mL/min (range, -0.28 to 3.80) and by the 0.5(Clc + Clu) was 0.30  (range, -0.67 to 1.52). The median overestimation of Cli during cimetidine  treatment in CP-2 was 0.43 mL/min (range, -0.21 to 1.20). The range, in  differences between Cli and Clc, in CP-2 was smaller than that between Cli and  0.5(Clc + Clu) in CP-1. The difference between the clearance rate of inulin and  creatinine or the combined clearance rate of urea and creatinine was not  influenced by the magnitude of the average GFR. It can be concluded that the  administration of cimetidine improved the accuracy of measuring the GFR with the  Clc in CAPD patients.","1996-05","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:57:50","","745-750","","5","7","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8738810","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Cimetidine/*pharmacology; *Kidney Function Tests; Creatinine/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Urea/metabolism; Inulin; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/metabolism; *Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood/therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P-CL of exogenous creatinine (P-CLcrea) and of inulin were determined in  dogs (n=12, Beagle, 6 months of age) and cats (n=11, Domestic Short Hair, 14  months of age). The marker substances were administered as a bolus injection. In  fasted dogs, P-CLcrea was 84.3 +/- 14.85 ml/min/m2 after a creatinine dose of 2.4  g/m2.

We examined the effects of elevated  acetaldehyde within the gastrointestinal tract on the permeability and  bioavailability of hydrophilic markers and drug molecules of variable molecular  weight and geometry. In vitro permeability was measured unidirectionally in  Caco-2 and MDCKII cell models in the presence of acetaldehyde, ethanol, or  disulfiram, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, which causes acetaldehyde  formation when coadministered with ethanol in vivo. Acetaldehyde significantly  lowered transepithelial resistance in cell monolayers and increased permeability  of the low-molecular-weight markers, mannitol and sucrose; however, permeability  of high-molecular-weight markers, polyethylene glycol and inulin, was not  affected. In vivo permeability was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated  for 6 days with ethanol, disulfiram, or saline alone or in combination.  Bioavailability of naproxen was not affected by any treatment, whereas that of  paclitaxel was increased upon acetaldehyde exposure. Although disulfiram has been  shown to inhibit multidrug resistance-1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro, our data  demonstrate that the known P-gp substrate paclitaxel is not affected by  coadministration of disulfiram. In conclusion, we demonstrate that acetaldehyde  significantly modulates tight junctions and paracellular permeability in vitro as  well as the oral bioavailability of low-molecular-weight hydrophilic probes and  therapeutic molecules in vivo even when these molecules are substrates for efflux  transporters.

DESIGN: A consecutive  sample of all eligible patients. SETTING: An eight-bed medical intensive care  unit in a university-affiliated tertiary-care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Ten  critically ill medical patients receiving gentamicin or tobramycin for presumed  or documented gram-negative bacillary infection were enrolled in the study. The  patients were mechanically ventilated and had underlying organ system  dysfunction. All ten patients completed the study. INTERVENTION: Patients  underwent renal functional assessment by measured inulin (Cl(in)) and 24-hour  urinary creatinine clearance (Clcr). Aminoglycoside serum concentrations were  used to estimate GFR and were compared with the two measured methods and a  creatinine clearance calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault method (ClCG). All  evaluations were performed the same day. RESULTS: Cl(in) averaged 51.6 +/- 35.0  mL/min and serum creatinine ranged from 0.3 to 5.4 mg/dL (26.5 to 477.3 mumol/L).  Steady-state peak and trough aminoglycoside concentrations were 6.1 +/- 1.4 and  1.3 +/- 0.9 micrograms/mL, respectively. There were no statistically significant  differences between the various methods, although the aminoglycoside-calculated  GFR (Cl(amg)) 95 percent confidence intervals were smaller than Clcr and ClCG  compared with Cl(in). Mean absolute errors were smaller with Cl(amg) than with  Clcr and ClCG. Regression results indicated that only Cl(amg) and ClCG  demonstrated agreement with Cl(in) (lines not different from y = x). However, the  Cl(amg) showed closer agreement, with a mean square error almost half that of  ClCG (9.6 vs. 18.1).

The elimination of inulin was highly  concentration-dependent, and in healthy volunteers the renal clearance fell from  103.7 +/- 14.4 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 during the first hour after administration to  49.1 +/- 20.9 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 over the period 6-8 h. In the patients with renal  failure the renal clearance fell correspondingly from 39.7 +/- 16.5 to 26.6 +/-  8.6 ml min-1 1.73 m-2. There were no changes in the simultaneously measured  clearances of creatinine. 3. The values obtained for the total body clearance of  inulin after a single injection depend critically on dose, the number and timing  of blood samples, the choice of pharmacokinetic model, the number of data points  chosen for estimation of the slope of the terminal elimination phase for analysis  by the methods of residuals, and the weighting used for curve fitting by  non-linear regression analysis. 4. With standardized conditions of sampling from  0 to 2 h and weighted non-linear regression analysis of the plasma  concentration-time data, the total body and renal clearances of inulin were  almost identical in subjects with normal renal function at 105.2 +/- 10.2 and  102.9 +/- 13.0 ml min-1 1.73 m-2.

A lower dose of  octanoic acid (500 mg/kg) increased 5-HIAA levels by 29% in the caudate and 20%  in the hypothalamus. However, it did not produce any changes in the concentration  of homovanillic acid in either the caudate or the hypothalamus. Treatment with  octanoic acid also failed to change the level of dopamine, serotonin, and  3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the caudate and the hypothalamus. The role of  carrier-mediated transport in the clearance of 5-HIAA from the rabbit CSF was  also evaluated in vivo by ventriculocisternal perfusion. Steady-state clearance  of 5-HIAA from CSF exceeded that of inulin and was reduced in the presence of  octanoic acid. Because this transport system in the choroid plexus is normally  responsible for the excretion of the serotonin metabolite from the brain to the  plasma, accumulation of endogenously produced organic acids in the brain,  secondary to reduced clearance by the choroid plexus, could be a contributing  factor in the development of encephalopathy in children with medium-chain  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency who have elevated levels of octanoic acid  systematically.","1992-04","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","1499-1503","","4","58","","J Neurochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1372345","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Biological Transport; Brain/*metabolism; Osmolar Concentration; Acids/*metabolism; Anions/metabolism; Biogenic Amines/*metabolism; Caprylates/*pharmacology; Choroid Plexus/*metabolism; Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The radioactive degradation products formed  from labeled proteins are relatively large, hydrophilic, resistant to lysosomal  hydrolases, and accumulate in lysosomes in the cells involved in degradation of  the carrier protein. However, the gradual loss of the catabolites from cells  (t1/2 approximately 2 days) has limited the usefulness of residualizing labels in  studies on longer lived proteins. We describe here a higher molecular weight (Mr  approximately 5000), more efficient residualizing glycoconjugate label,  inulin-125I-tyramine (125I-InTn). Attachment of 125I-InTn had no effect on the  plasma half-life or tissue sites of catabolism of asialofetuin, fetuin, or rat  serum albumin in the rat. The half-life for hepatic retention of degradation  products from 125I-InTn-labeled asialofetuin was 5 days, compared to 2.3 days for  125I-DLT-labeled asialofetuin. The whole body half-lives for radioactivity from  125I-InTn-, 125I-DLT-, and 125I-labeled rat serum albumin were 7.5, 4.3, and 2.2  days, respectively. The tissue distribution of degradation products from  125I-InTn-labeled proteins agreed with results of previous studies using  125I-DLT, except that a greater fraction of total degradation products was  recovered in tissues. Kinetic analyses indicated that the average half-life for  retention of 125I-InTn degradation products in tissues is approximately 5 days  and suggested that in vivo there are both slow and rapid routes for release of  degradation products from cells. Overall, these experiments indicate that  125I-InTn should provide greater sensitivity and more accurate quantitative  information on the sites of catabolism of long-lived circulating proteins in  vivo.","1988-10-05","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","14122-14127","","28","263","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2459117","","","","Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Tritium; Rats, Inbred Strains; Tissue Distribution; Models, Theoretical; Serum Albumin/metabolism; Blood Proteins/*metabolism; alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism; Iodine Radioisotopes; Inulin/*analogs & derivatives/blood/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics; Tyramine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with  results in intact dogs, the surgical procedure removed between 41 and 55% of the  rapidly equilibrating tissues and reduced the permeability coefficient-surface  area products for the rapidly equilibrating inulin and urea compartments  proportionately. This is consistent with the concept that splanchnic organs  equilibrate rapidly with inulin and urea because they are supplied by fenestrated  and discontinuous capillaries that are prominent in the splanchnic vascular bed.  However, splanchnic organs probably do not contain all rapidly equilibrating  tissues, and somatic tissues may contribute as much as 36 and 22%, respectively,  of the rapidly equilibrating inulin and urea compartments.

Since  enalaprilat has two functional acidic groups, it is likely that it may be  secreted via the proximal tubule organic acid system and, thus, its clearances  would exceed that of glomerular filtration rate markers. We therefore examined  the renal clearance of enalaprilat in normal volunteers and compared it with  simultaneously measured inulin and creatinine clearances to explore the  contribution of tubular secretion to the renal elimination of the drug. Twelve  healthy male subjects with an age range of 24 to 58 years (mean +/- SE, 33.1 +/-  2.8) were studied. They had representative height (178.6 +/- 1.99 cm) and weight  (73.3 +/- 2.1 kg) and had normal renal function as judged by blood urea nitrogen  (BUN) (6 +/- 0.3 mmol/L [17 +/- 0.8 mg/dL]), plasma creatinine (88 +/- 3 mumol/L  [1.0 +/- 0.03 mg/dL]), and creatinine clearance determined by a prestudy 24-hour  urine collection (123.2 +/- 6.2 mL/min). Results are as follows: mean creatinine  clearance, 2.12 mL/s (127 mL/min); mean inulin clearance, 119.1 ml/min mean  creatinine clearance/inulin clearance, 1.07 mean enalaprilat protein binding,  37.9% unbound enalaprilat clearance, 222.4 ml/min; and the mean fractional  enalaprilat clearances were: enalaprilat clearance/creatinine clearance, 1.72 (P  less than 0.05, difference from 1.0); enalaprilat clearance/inulin clearance,  1.85, (P less than 0.05, difference from 1.0).

Late proximal  (TF/P)Li was 1.01 after oral Li+, 1.16 after intravenous Li+ (P < 0.01), and 1.00  during osmotic diuresis. It is concluded that proximal Li+ transfer is distinct  from that of Na+, closely parallels proximal water transfer, and involves an  active transport mechanism independent of the PD.

The treatments were 1.5 g KCl/kg  body weight (BW) and 1.5 g Na citrate/kg BW. Inulin and p-aminohippuric acid  (PAH) clearance rates were used as measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), respectively, in control cows on each  treatment day. Creatinine clearance rate was also used as a measure of GFR in all  cows. Magnesium loading (2.4 mg/kg BW) through continuous intrajugular infusion  of MgCl2 facilitated the measurement of changes in Mg clearance rate and  reabsorption due to treatment. Inulin and creatinine clearance rates were not  different as measures of GFR, and there were no differences in ERPF between young  and old cows. Old cows had lower (P less than .05) GFR, creatinine to PAH  clearance ratios and tubular reabsorption of Mg than young cows. Intraruminal  infusion of KCl and Na citrate increased (P less than .05) the GFR.

The total clearance was  calculated from the decay of the serum inulin concentration after injection of  3000 mg/m(2)body surface area using a two-compartment model.

The aim of this study was to determine  whether CTAP can enter the central nervous system (CNS) by crossing either the  blood-brain barrier or the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (CSF) and to  characterize the mechanism of CNS entry. CNS entry of [3H]CTAP was compared with  that of the vascular space marker [14C]inulin and the mu-agonist [3H]morphine. By  using an in situ brain perfusion technique coupled to high-performance liquid  chromatographic analysis, greater amounts of radioactivity were detected in the  brain or CSF at most time points for [3H]CTAP, compared with [14C]inulin.  [3H]CTAP was found to remain predominantly intact in the brain after a 20-min rat  brain perfusion (62.8%). CTAP was also stable in the blood and serum of rats  (T1/2 > 500 min), showing that the structure of this peptide offers enzymatic  resistance. Additionally, [3H]CTAP was found to be extensively protein-bound to  albumin in the perfusion medium (68.2%) and to proteins in rat serum (84.2%).  Entry into the brain and CSF was not inhibited by the addition of unlabeled CTAP  to the perfusion medium, suggesting that passage into the CNS is most likely  through diffusion across the membranes that comprise the blood-brain barrier,  rather than by saturable transport. Also, greater amounts of [3H]morphine entered  both the brain and CSF after a 20-min brain perfusion, compared with [3H]CTAP.  The increased CNS penetration observed for [3H]morphine, compared with [3H]CTAP,  is likely due to the increased lipophilicity of morphine, as shown by its higher  octanol/saline partition coefficient. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile, CTAP  may be a promising mu-selective antagonist that can be used as a treatment for  opiate overdose or addiction and also as a pharmacological tool to further  understand opioid neurobiology.","1997-01","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","402-409","","1","280","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8996221","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Mice; Protein Binding; Biological Availability; Permeability; Solubility; Peptide Fragments; Somatostatin; *Blood-Brain Barrier; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Narcotics/*pharmacokinetics; Peptides/pharmacokinetics; Receptors, Opioid, mu/*antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

T.; Arisz, L.","Discrepancy between circadian rhythms of inulin and creatinine clearance.","The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine","","0022-2143","","","To elucidate the disparity between circadian rhythmicity of inulin and creatinine clearance, we simultaneously measured inulin and creatinine clearances every 3  hours during 1 day in 14 normal subjects and in 8 patients with nephrotic  syndrome. All patients and normal subjects had a circadian rhythm for inulin  clearance with a maximum during daytime and a relative amplitude of 21% +/- 2%.  For creatinine clearance a rhythm was either absent or reduced in relative  amplitude (p less than 0.01). In all subjects the rate of tubular creatinine  secretion was higher at minimum of inulin clearance (night) than at maximum  (day). The fractional clearance (relative to inulin) of creatinine was also  higher during the night: normal subjects, 1.28 +/- 0.02 versus 1.10 +/- 0.02;  patients, 1.78 +/- 0.08 versus 1.45 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.005). This  demonstrates the inaccuracy of creatinine clearance as a measure of glomerular  filtration rate (GFR). By subsequent blocking of the tubular secretion of  creatinine with cimetidine in four normal subjects, creatinine clearance became  similar to inulin clearance during day and night. This confirms that high tubular  secretion of creatinine during the night counteracts the normal rhythmicity of  glomerular filtration of creatinine. As a result, plasma creatinine concentration  is nearly constant during a 24-hour period. In conclusion, tubular creatinine  secretion has a circadian rhythm with a phase opposite to the rhythm of GFR, thus  blunting or causing absence of a circadian rhythm for creatinine clearance.","1992-09","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:00","","400-410","","3","120","","J Lab Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1517687","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Cimetidine/pharmacology; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/*metabolism; Nephrotic Syndrome/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aluminium (as sulphate or  citrate) was administered intravenously to conscious rats at doses ranging from  25 micrograms (0.93 mumol) to 800 micrograms (29.6 mumol) aluminium, and  aluminium excretion was monitored over the following 2 h. Measurements of the  filterability of aluminium from the rat plasma, and the glomerular filtration  rate (inulin clearance), enabled us to calculate the filtered load of aluminium,  and hence determine aluminium reabsorption. At all doses of administered  aluminium, that administered as sulphate was excreted less effectively than that  administered as citrate. This difference was attributable to the much greater  filterability of aluminium administered as citrate. However, for any given  filtered load, the excretion of aluminium administered as citrate was not  significantly different (in either fractional or absolute terms) from the  excretion of aluminium administered as sulphate. It seems likely that, following  aluminium sulphate administration, the filtered aluminium may be an aluminium  citrate form which is then reabsorbed in the same way as aluminium administered  as citrate. It is thus apparent that aluminium removal from the body could be  further enhanced if it were possible to prevent the tubular reabsorption of the  aluminium species which is so effectively filtered following aluminium citrate  administration.","1995-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","494-499","","6","14","","Hum Exp Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8519525","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Structure-Activity Relationship; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Infusions, Intravenous; Kidney/*metabolism; Absorption; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Spectrophotometry, Atomic; Citric Acid; Alum Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Aluminum/blood/*urine; Citrates/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among four batches of [3H]inulin received within 5 mo, two were found  relatively pure, whereas two were partly decomposed to lower-molecular-weight  fragments. The chromatographic profile of pure isotopes was not significantly  affected by redistribution and freeze drying, nor by subsequent storage in the  freeze-dried state at -20 degrees C for up to 5 mo, nor by incubation in aqueous  solution at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Three batches of [3H]inulin with different  grades of decomposition (noninulin percentages 13%, 38%, and 61%, respectively)  were selected for clearance experiments and infused simultaneously with cold and  undecomposed [14C]inulin to conscious rats. [14C]inulin had a significantly  higher clearance than cold inulin (+7.6 +/- 0.6%) and relatively pure [3H]inulin  (+12.4 +/- 0.4%). Decomposed [3H]inulin isotopes progressively underestimated  clearance of cold inulin to an extent related to the degree of decomposition.  Thus at the end of the 5-h clearance experiment, ratios between clearance of  tracer and of cold inulin were 0.92, 0.71, and 0.60 for the three 3H isotopes,  respectively. This study indicates that [3H]inulin delivered from leading  manufacturers may be decomposed to an extent that invalidates its use as a marker  for glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is thus necessary to check the purity  routinely before use. Within the same rat, clearance of undecomposed [3H]inulin  and [14C]inulin may differ by 12%, and for this reason they should not be used  interchangeably as GFR markers.","1991-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","F283-289","","2 Pt 2","260","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1996678","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Carbon Radioisotopes; Chromatography; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Inulin/pharmacokinetics; *Tritium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) responses to captopril and to angiotensin II (Ang II) were  measured as paraminohippuric acid and inulin clearances.

These two exponentials are generally  regarded to represent equilibration of agent throughout the extracellular fluid  (ECF) space and renal clearance, respectively. In seven subjects undergoing  diagnostic arteriography, arterial and antecubital venous plasma samples were  obtained up to 60 min in five and up to 120 min in two following simultaneous  intravenous injection of 99Tcm-diethylene triamine pentaacetate (99Tcm-DTPA) and  inulin. The count rate from 99Tcm was simultaneously recorded over the calf with  a collimated scintillation probe in five subjects up to 60 min post-injection.  The arterial and venous time-concentration curves were interpolated and  subtracted to give a curve of the arterio-venous (A-V) concentration difference,  which was then integrated. Arterial time-concentration curves display three  exponentials, the first of which has the largest amplitude and disappears by  about 20 min. The A-V concentration difference becomes zero at about the same  time. The integral of the A-V concentration difference, which represents activity  in the interstitial space of the forearm, has a time course consistent with the  second compartment of a model of two compartments in series (the first being  plasma) and a time course that is reciprocally similar to the first exponential  of the triexponential arterial plasma curve. The curve externally recorded by  scintillation probe has a shape consistent with a signal that is the composite of  interstitial 99Tcm-DTPA and plasma 99Tcm-DTPA activities. The arterial plasma  clearance curve of GFR agents is triexponential; the first exponential reflects  equilibration of agent between plasma and the interstitial space of carcass  tissue (mainly muscle and skin).

Sodium restriction  alone had no effect on renal clearances but did increase plasma renin activity  and urinary prostaglandin E excretion. The addition of aspirin decreased the  urinary clearance of prostaglandin E but not plasma renin activity, and caused a  significant fall in both endogenous creatinine (from 92.3 +/- 4.1 SE ml/min .  1.73 m2 body surface area to 80.8 +/- 4.4 mL/min . 1.73 m2, p = 0.02) and inulin  (from 95.3 +/- 7.0 mL/min . 1.73 m2 to 80.9 +/- 7.0 mL/min . 1.73 m2, p less than  0.001). The fall in inulin clearance was directly related to the salicylate  level. The clearance of para-aminohippurate showed only a slight, statistically  insignificant decline with aspirin. The results of this study suggest that  aspirin-induced depression of glomerular filtration rate may be independent of  total renal plasma flow.

FPRNa was also estimated from changes in  maximal free water clearance (CH2O). According to the latter method, FPRNa  dropped from 85.7 +/- 2.2 to 81.3 +/- 3.4%, whereas inulin clearance rose from  125 +/- 11 to 149 +/- 15 ml/min. The changes in CLi were surprisingly large, from  40.6 +/- 7.6 to 75.8 +/- 18.4 ml/min. If lithium is a valid marker of Na handling  in the proximal tubule in humans, this change would imply a fall in FPRNa from  67.5 +/- 3.9 to 49.7 +/- 9.0%, suggesting a much larger shift in tubular Na  reabsorption in escape than hitherto suspected. In addition, it would suggest  that the inevitable back diffusion of a part of the solute-free water in the  distal nephron, and thus overestimation of FPRNa by the CH2O method, increases  importantly during escape. Alternately, lithium may not be a good marker of  proximal tubular Na handling. For instance, both lithium reabsorption and escape  may take place beyond the proximal tubule, or lithium may be excreted in the  distal nephron in certain conditions. Present methods do not permit further  analysis of these options in the human model.","1987-03","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:02:37","","F382-386","","3 Pt 2","252","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3826382","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Body Weight; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Blood Pressure; Mathematics; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/metabolism; Sodium/metabolism; Blood Volume; Lithium/*metabolism; Mineralocorticoids/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. PATIENTS:  Thirteen patients with lupus nephritis with mild renal insufficiency (mean serum  creatinine, 230 mumol/L [2.6 mg/dL]; median, 106 mumol/L [1.2 mg/dL]).  INTERVENTIONS: Patients were given placebo or cimetidine tablets, 400 mg four  times daily for 2 days, with ambulatory 24-hour urine collection during the  second 24 hours (""outpatient study""). Simultaneous 4-hour  technetium-99-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Tc99-DTPA) and CCrs were  measured immediately after each 24-hour collection (""simultaneous study"").  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Use of cimetidine improved the accuracy of CCr, as  measured by the CDTPA-to-CCr ratio (1.07 [cimetidine] compared with 1.33  [placebo]; P less than 0.05). Cimetidine use also improved the precision of CCr  (P less than 0.05). In addition, when compared with standard clinical estimators  of GFR, creatinine clearance with cimetidine rendered the most precise estimates  of GFR and explained more of the variation in GFR estimation than did any other  method (R2 = 0.78 compared with R2 = 0.52 to 0.63). These effects were shown  under both simultaneous and outpatient conditions. No side effects due to  cimetidine occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lupus nephritis, the  cimetidine-aided CCr offers a compromise between the precise and accurate but  expensive and inconvenient research techniques (inulin, iothalamate, or DTPA  clearances) and the grossly inaccurate and imprecise but convenient technique  (CCr) for determining GFR.","1990-10-01","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:39","","501-506","","7","113","","Ann Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2393206","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Reproducibility of Results; Random Allocation; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Confidence Intervals; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects; Creatinine/*metabolism; *Cimetidine; Lupus Nephritis/*metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The performance is simple, it needs only a few blood samples,  nor does it need any urine collection, the radiation dose is low and it seems to  be more accurate than the endogenous creatinine clearance.","1982","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:00:39","","237-241","","3","16","","Scand J Urol Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 6761859","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Child, Preschool; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney Function Tests; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate; *Pentetic Acid/administration & dosage/metabolism; *Technetium/administration & dosage/metabolism; Inulin/administration & dosage/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The biliary excretion of seven model substrates  in 96-h sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes was determined by differential  cumulative uptake of substrate in the monolayers preincubated in standard buffer  (intact bile canaliculi) and Ca2+-free buffer (disrupted bile canaliculi).  Biliary excretion in vivo was quantitated in bile duct-cannulated rats. The  biliary excretion index of model substrates, equivalent to the percentage of  retained substrate in the canalicular networks, was consistent with the  percentage of the dose excreted in bile from in vivo experiments. The in vitro  biliary clearance of inulin, salicylate, methotrexate, [D-pen2,5]enkephalin, and  taurocholate, calculated as the ratio of the amount excreted into the bile  canalicular networks and the area under the incubation medium concentration-time  profile ( approximately 0, approximately 0, 4.1 +/- 1.0, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 56. 2  +/- 6.0 ml/min/kg, respectively), correlated with their intrinsic in vivo biliary  clearance (0.04, 0, 17.3, 34.4, and 116.9 ml/min/kg, respectively; r2 = 0.99).  The model compound 264W94 was not excreted in bile either in vivo or in vitro.  The glucuronide conjugate of 2169W94, the O-demethylated metabolite of 264W94,  was excreted into bile in vitro when 2169W94, but not 264W94, was incubated with  the monolayers; 2169W94 glucuronide undergoes extensive biliary excretion after  administration of 264W94 or 2169W94 in vivo. Biliary excretion in long-term  sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes correlates with in vivo biliary excretion. The  study of biliary excretion of metabolites in the hepatocyte monolayers requires  consideration of the status of metabolic activities.","1999-06","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","637-644","","6","27","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10348791","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Area Under Curve; Biotransformation; Rats, Wistar; Cells, Cultured; Bile Canaliculi/metabolism; Bile/chemistry/*metabolism; Liver/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism; Thiazepines/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, it has been shown  that acute volume expansion within 6 h of glycerol administration reverses the  fall in inulin clearance but volume expansion 12-24 h after glycerol fails to  restore that parameter to normal. The current studies were performed to determine  whether chronic volume expansion would prevent the fall in inulin clearance  normally observed 18-20 h after the insult. Inulin clearance was therefore  compared 18-20 h after glycerol in hydropenic rats and in rats undergoing chronic  volume expansion by the constant infusion of Ringer solution at a rate of 5 ml/h  initiated at the time of the glycerol injection. Inulin clearance was well  maintained in the latter group, averaging 1.77 compared with 0.22 ml/min in the  hydropenic group. Renal histology revealed no difference in the degree of tubular  necrosis between groups but did show a marked decrease in cast formation in the  animals undergoing chronic volume expansion. To determine the possible  significance of these casts, micropuncture studies were carried out to measure  proximal tubular pressures. Under hydropenic conditions these pressures were not  different control animals and rats receiving glycerol when studied 18-20 h after  glycerol. Following acute volume expansion, however, glycerol-treated rats  demonstrated significantly higher pressures than control rats. On the other hand,  proximal tubular pressures were comparable in glycerol-treated and control  animals receiving the chronic volume expansion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1986-02","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","F315-321","","2 Pt 2","250","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3946607","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Pressure; Inulin/metabolism; *Glycerol; Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced/*physiopathology; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: Cats that were renal  intact (n = 3) or had renal mass reduced by partial nephrectomy (n = 6).  PROCEDURE: Plasma clearance of inulin (PCln) was taken as the quotient of the  administered dose of inulin (150 mg) divided by the area under the plasma inulin  concentration versus time curve determined by 3 methods (PCln1-PCln3). Results  for PCln were compared with simultaneously obtained values for urinary clearance  of exogenous creatinine (CCr), an accepted method for the estimation of  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in cats. RESULTS: Values for PCln were closely  related (R2 ranged from 0.951 to 0.972, P < 0.0001 in all instances) to CCr.  However, PCln3 provided an estimate of GFR that consistently overestimated CCr.  CONCLUSION: Determination of PCln by use of PCln1 and PCln2 provided a reliable  estimate of GFR in cats of this study. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Determination of PCln  appears to provide a reliable estimate of GFR in cats with early-stage renal  disease and no evidence of derangement of body fluid status. In particular,  PCln2, which requires only 3 determinations of plasma inulin concentration,  should be considered when an estimate of GFR is sought in a cat with suspected  early-stage renal disease.","1996-12","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:02:09","","1702-1705","","12","57","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8950421","","","","Animals; Injections, Intravenous; Regression Analysis; Cats; Nephrectomy; Creatinine/blood/urine; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*veterinary; *Inulin/blood/pharmacokinetics; Cat Diseases; Kidney Diseases/diagnosis/physiopathology/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplement","","0098-6577","","","The transperitoneal movement of solute in children was examined by means of a theoretical consideration of the peritoneal clearance formula and by the  performance of peritoneal solute diffusion curves and measurement of peritoneal  clearances of multiple solutes. Theoretical considerations led to the conclusion  that when dialysis mechanics are held constant, peritoneal clearances scaled for  weight are similar in individuals of widely varying weight when the volume of  infused dialysate is also scaled for weight if peritoneal permeability and  surface area are constant. In one group of studies, solute diffusion curves and  weight-scaled peritoneal clearances of urea, phosphate, creatinine, and urate  were similar in 3 children ages 4 to 18 months compared to 4 children ages 2.5 to  18.5 years. In a second group of studies, weight-scaled peritoneal clearances of  inulin but not urea were shown to be marginally lower in 4 children who had been  dialyzed longer than 6 months compared with 4 children dialyzed less than 1  month. Hypertonic glucose dialysis in these children was shown to enhance urea  clearance but not that of inulin. It is concluded that comparative studies of  peritoneal clearances can characterize the transperitoneal movement of solute in  children of widely varying body size. Such studies are of greatest value when  systematically performed and similar ratios of dialysate volumes to body pools of  solute are used.","1983-11","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 09:01:02","","S95-100","","","15","","Kidney Int Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6584681","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Time Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Biological Transport; Child; Child, Preschool; Blood Urea Nitrogen; Creatinine/metabolism; Uric Acid/metabolism; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism; Peritoneal Dialysis; Urea/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Phosphates/metabolism; Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; Peritoneum/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is designed to discover if the rate-determining step in its  net renal secretion is uptake into the renal tubule. The tissue uptake clearance  of alendronate by the kidney, estimated from an integration plot analysis and  normalized with respect to plasma protein binding, was 4.2 times higher at a  tracer dose than that of inulin, indicating uptake of alendronate by the renal  tubules. The uptake clearance is comparable with the net secretion clearance  obtained from an infusion study, indicating that the rate-determining step in the  net secretion is uptake under the tracer conditions. When the dose was increased,  however, there was no reduction in uptake clearance while the net secretion  clearance fell to almost zero. The urinary excretion clearance defined with  respect to the steady state concentration in the kidney also fell to almost zero.  This result suggests that saturation of the net secretion of alendronate is  caused by saturation of membrane transport through the brush-border membrane.  Thus, it would seem that there is a transport mechanism for alendronate on the  brush-border membrane of kidney epithelial cells.","1999-05","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:39:35","","193-198","","4","20","","Biopharm Drug Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10440794","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Protein Binding; Kidney/*metabolism; Blood Proteins/metabolism; Kidney Tubules/metabolism; Microvilli/metabolism; Secretory Rate/drug effects; Alendronate/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An attempt to accurately measure glomerular filtration].","Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis","","1427-440X","","","Measurement of creatinine concentrations in serum and urine has for many years been a routine method for studying renal function in general and glomerular  filtration in particular. Unfortunately, the method remains inaccurate due to  partial excretion of creatinine by way of active tubular transport. Solutions are  awaited to suppress tubular excretion and thus improve the reliability of  creatinine clearance for the assessment of renal function. This work was designed  to determine whether H2 receptor blockers are capable of suppressing tubular  transport of creatinine. The study group consisted of 76 healthy individuals  randomly assigned to groups which were placed on cimetidine, ranitidine or  famotidine. Creatinine clearance was measured in all participants. Inulin  clearance was determined only in participants receiving the full dose of  cimetidine (3 x 200 mg + 400 mg after 12 h). It was found that the full  cimetidine dose significantly reduced creatinine clearance from 109.46 to 75.62  mL/min. Correlation between inulin and creatinine clearances was stronger after  the full dose, as well as in subjects with initially lower creatinine clearance  values. Administration of a single 400 mg dose of cimetidine, ranitidine 300 mg  or famotidine 40 mg produced an insignificant reduction in creatinine clearance.  The present findings suggest that the full dose of cimetidine is capable of  inhibiting tubular transport of creatinine and thus may improve the accuracy of  creatinine clearance measurements for the study of renal function.","2004","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:59:34","","97-105","","1","50","","Ann Acad Med Stetin","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 16871748","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Aged; Cimetidine/*pharmacology; Histamine H2 Antagonists/*pharmacology; Ranitidine/pharmacology; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Kidney Function Tests; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects; Famotidine/pharmacology; Metabolic Clearance Rate/*drug effects; Creatinine/*blood/*urine; Kidney Tubules, Distal/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: Nine cats  including 6 clinically healthy cats and 3 cats with spontaneous chronic kidney  disease. METHODS: Retrospective study. Inulin was administered as an intravenous  bolus at 50 mg/kg to cats, and blood was collected at 60, 90, and 120 minutes  later for the 3-sample method. Serum inulin concentrations were colorimetrically  determined by an autoanalyzer method. The GFR in the single-blood-sample method  was calculated from the dose injected, serum concentration, sampling time, and  estimated volume of distribution on the basis of the data of the 3-sample method.  RESULTS: An excellent correlation was observed (r = 0.99, P = .0001) between GFR  values estimated by the single-blood-sample and 3-sample methods.

In this study we investigated the effect of conjugation with  oxidized inulin on these properties. Inulin (MW about 25kDa) was oxidized with  periodate and was conjugated to the enzyme at molar ratios of oxidized inulin to  enzyme between 2:1 and 4:1. Modified L-asparaginase synthesized at ratio of 2:1  had activity of 65% of that of native enzyme and was used in subsequent  experiments. The apparent K(m) of glycoconjugate (0.1 x 10(-4)M) was about five  times lower than the K(m) of native enzyme (0.57 x 10(-4)M). Modified  L-asparaginase had longer half life, higher thermostability and more resistance  to trypsin digestion and better reusability after repeated freezing and wider  optimum pH range than that of intact L-asparaginase. The modification of  L-asparaginase with oxidized inulin at molar ratio of 2:1 resulted in decreasing  antibody (IgG) titer and immunogenecity after repeated injection of rabbits with  respect to the native L-asparaginase. Taken together, the results of this study  indicated that L-asparaginase modification by oxidized inulin results in a new  stabilized product with improved biochemical properties which may be employed for  medical purposes.","2009-05-20","2023-07-10 08:39:35","2023-07-10 08:58:04","","189-195","","3-4","141","","J Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19433225","","","","Male; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Rabbits; Protein Binding; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Temperature; Linear Models; Freeze Drying; Inulin/*metabolism; Enzyme Stability; Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/metabolism; Asparaginase/immunology/*metabolism; Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism; Immunoglobulin G/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Our  aim was to review the role of some fructans in the absorption of vitamins and  minerals in children and adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of  the absorption of nutrients with fructans. We collected quantitative data for our  thematic analysis, which was performed using the electronic databases Medline,  Lilacs, Web of Science, and Scopus from January 2000 and January 2019. This  review comprises a total of 10 articles. RESULTS: Few studies were found  regarding the use of prebiotics and nutrient absorption in children. Studies on  calcium, iron, magnesium, and vitamin D were the most prevalent. Some studies  reported that FOS appears to increase calcium uptake in the gut and stimulates  the growth of bifidobacterium in the colon, reducing iron intake by enteric  pathogens, and increasing the absorption of these minerals. Others reported an  improvement in the absorption of vitamin D and E with inulin. CONCLUSION:  Consumption of fructans improves the health of the microbiota, altering the  absorption of some nutrients.","2020-04","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","166-169","","3","27","","Arch Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 French Society of Pediatrics.

This should occur by the stimulation of benign or potentially health promoting  genera but not the harmful groups. Because of their positive attributes  bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are the most frequent target organisms. Both  inulin and oligofructose have been demonstrated to be effective prebiotics. This  has been shown through both in vitro and in vivo assessments in different  laboratories. Because of their recognised prebiotic properties, principally the  selective stimulation of colonic bifidobacteria, both inulin and oligofructose  are increasingly used in new food product developments. Examples include drinks,  yoghurts, biscuits and table spreads. Because of the recognised inhibitory  effects that bifidobacteria can exert against gut pathogens, one of the most  important aspects of prebiotic ingestion is fortification of the gut flora to  resist acute infections.","2002-05","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","S193-197","","","87 Suppl 2","","Br J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12088518","","","","Humans; Intestinal Absorption; Dietary Fiber/*metabolism; Fermentation; Inulin/*metabolism; Bifidobacterium/*metabolism; Colon/*microbiology; Intestinal Diseases/metabolism/prevention & control; Lactobacillus/*metabolism; Oligosaccharides/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ideally, it requires  the measurement of the renal clearance of a filtration marker. Inulin, an  exogenous marker, is the only compound the excretion of which occurs exclusively  by glomerular filtration, with no tubular handling. Therefore, inulin clearance  provides the most accurate method to measure GFR and is considered as the ""gold  standard"", at all ages including very premature neonates. However, inulin  dearance is cumbersome and alternative methods are used in clinical practice. If  urine is available, endogenous creatinine clearance is the most reliable method.  When urine collection is difficult to obtain, GFR can be estimated by the plasma  concentration of endogenous markers mainly eliminated by glomerular filtration,  such as creatinine, or the more recently described cystatin C and beta  2-microglobulin. When the endogenous production of these markers is constant,  their plasma concentration reflects glomerular filtration; it increases with  decreasing renal function. However, in pediatric patients creatinine production  depends on muscle mass, which significantly increases with linear growth, as well  as age and gender. Mathematical formulas taking these parameters into account  have thus been developed. Among these, the so-called ""Schwartz formula"" is often  used and is a reliable estimate of GFR in children. Finally, radionuclide renal  scans can be used to evaluate the separate glomerular function of each kidney.","2002-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","625-630","","12","122","","Rev Med Suisse Romande","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 12611189","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Age Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Sex Characteristics; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Cystatin C; Creatinine/*metabolism; *Inulin/pharmacokinetics; beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism; Biomarkers/blood/*urine; Cystatins/*metabolism; Iohexol/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/*diagnosis/*metabolism; Nephrology/methods; Pediatrics/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten sows were divided into two groups, receiving either a control diet,  or a diet with 3% inulin. The diets were fed from 3 weeks ante partum to 6 weeks  post partum. In the first 2 weeks of life, piglets received only sow's milk.  Irrespective to sex and without castration of males, four piglets (one piglet of  each litter) from each group were selected and sacrificed on day 10 of age. The  gastrointestinal tract of each piglet was removed and segments were immediately  taken from the mid-jejunum and mounted in Ussing chambers. Furthermore, at  weaning (6 weeks old) 8 piglets were randomly selected irrespective to sex and  males were un-castrated (4 animals from sows received control diet and 4 animals  from sows received 3% inulin supplemented diet) and fed for 2 weeks either  control weaning diet or inulin supplemented diet. Thereafter segments of the  mid-jejunum were used to investigate the effect of inulin on the gut  electrophysiology of weaned piglets. The increase in short-circuit current (Isc)  after the addition of glucose is an indicator of higher glucose absorption and  the higher tissue conductance (Gt) of the epithelium suggested a higher  intestinal permeability to paracellular Na(+). In suckling piglets, the addition  of d-glucose on the luminal side of the isolated jejunal mucosa increased  (P<0.001) the Isc in the inulin-supplemented and control groups compared to basal  values. Electrogenic glucose transport (ΔIsc) was similar in suckling piglets  from sows fed inulin or control diet, suggesting that feeding of inulin to the  mother sows had no effect on glucose absorption across the jejunal mucosa of  suckling piglets. However, the dietary inulin supplementation after weaning  increased the ΔIsc (P<0.001) compared with the controls, suggesting that the  inulin supplementation increased the electrogenic transport of glucose across the  jejunal mucosa of weaned piglets indicating higher glucose absorption.  Furthermore, the Gt was higher in the inulin-supplemented weaned piglets than in  control piglets, which could be due to the increased paracellular permeability to  Na(+). In conclusion, dietary inulin increased the glucose transport and altered  the intestinal barrier by increasing the intestinal permeability in the jejunal  mucosa of post-weaned piglets. Furthermore, the results indicated that inulin has  a positive effect on glucose absorption in the piglet small intestine after  weaning and subsequently the dietary inulin offers a promising approach to avoid  post-weaning gastrointestinal tract disorders in pigs.","2013-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","249-254","","1","95","","Res Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In a randomized, double-blinded, crossover design, the  teens received a diet containing either 9 g/d oligofructose-enriched inulin in a  calcium-fortified cereal or the control cereal with no inulin. Both diets  contained ~1500 mg calcium daily. Calcium retention was determined on the third  week of each period. On day 14 of the diet period, fractional calcium absorption  was determined from the enrichment of (44)Ca in 4-day urine collections. RESULTS:  Calcium absorption (67 ± 3 vs. 66 ± 3%) and retention (409 ± 394 vs. 464 ± 241  mg/d) were not significantly different when diets contained 9 g/d  oligofructose-enriched inulin or not in a calcium-fortified cereal. CONCLUSIONS:  Daily consumption of cereal containing a combination of short- and long-chain  fructo-oligosaccharides as part of a controlled diet did not benefit calcium  absorption or retention in adolescent girls. Lack of response to the prebiotic in  this cohort may relate to their already high calcium absorption efficiency.","2010-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","382-386","","4","29","","J Am Coll Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21041813","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Intestinal Absorption; Cross-Over Studies; Child; Edible Grain; Food, Fortified; *Prebiotics; Inulin/*pharmacology; Oligosaccharides/*pharmacology; Calcium Isotopes/pharmacokinetics; Calcium, Dietary/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess the  validity of the model, 3H-morphine and unlabeled morphine (2 mg) were injected  epidurally in ten dogs. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), azygos venous blood,  arterial blood, and lymph were sampled before and 5, 20, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300  and 360 min after injection. During the first 20 min, morphine levels in the  azygos vein were about three and ten times greater than arterial and lymphatic  levels, respectively (n = 3; P less than 0.01). Morphine levels were  significantly greater in the azygos vein (n = 8) and the femoral artery (n = 10)  during the first 20 and 60 min than they were later, respectively (P less than  0.05). In the lymph (n = 5), the levels of morphine at 60 min were statistically  greater (P less than 0.05) than levels at 4, 5, and 6 hr. At no time were the  concurrent arterial and lymph levels different from each other. In the lumbar  CSF, the morphine peak concentration was reached 5-60 min after epidural  injection and ranged between 5 and 93 micrograms/ml. In the CSF, the levels of  morphine were significantly greater during the first 20 min than later (n = 7; P  less than 0.05).

Coronary arteries of the isolated rabbit heart were perfused at  constant pressure with Tris-buffered Ringer's solution (pH = 7.4, 37 degrees C)  with and without drug present in the perfusion fluid. A mixture of [3H]inulin and  [14C]sucrose was injected into the left ventricular wall. From measured clearance  rates, capillary permeability-surface area products (PS) (in milliliters per  minute per 100 g) were computed for both solutes by the method of Gosselin and  Stibitz (Pflügers Arch. 318: 85-98, 1970). Mean control PS values were 60.7 and  14.1 for sucrose and inulin, respectively. This computation required experimental  determination of the myocardial volume of distribution (in milliliters per gram)  for each reference solute. Values of myocardial volume of distribution obtained  in the presence of nitroglycerin, isoproterenol and histamine did not differ  significantly from controls. In paired clearance trials, isoproterenol and  nitroglycerin significantly increased coronary flow, but neither drug influenced  PS-inulin, PS-sucrose or the ratio PS inulin/PS sucrose. In contrast, histamine  caused an apparently irreversible decrease in flow. Furthermore, in the presence  of histamine, PS inulin/PS sucrose increased from 0.28 +/- 0.03 to 0.40 +/- 0.05  (P less than 0.003). This rise is consonant with a widening of diffusion channels  between neighboring endothelial cells in the capillary wall. Thus, histamine (and  presumably substances capable of histamine release) appears to increase  myocardial permeability to microsolutes, in addition to its well known ability to  enhance protein transport across postcapillary venules.","1985-07","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","19-24","","1","234","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3925126","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Myocardium/*metabolism; Heart/drug effects; Inulin/*metabolism; Capillary Permeability/*drug effects; Histamine/*pharmacology; Isoproterenol/*pharmacology; Nitroglycerin/*pharmacology; Sucrose/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The perilymphatic  entry characteristics of 2 neutral molecules, mannitol (182.2 Da) and inulin  (7,000 Da), were studied. A polyethylene catheter was placed in contact with the  guinea pig round window membrane and sealed with cyanoacrylate glue. This  catheter was linked to an osmotic minipump that delivered 100 microl portions of  3H-mannitol or 3H-inulin solutions over a 7-day period at a constant rate (0.5  microl/h). Perilymph in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) and plasma were sampled after 4-7 days of delivery. RESULTS: Despite  the constant rate of infusion, perilymphatic radioactivity varied widely from one  animal to the other, probably as a function of the position of the microcatheter  within the round window niche and/or the permeability of the round window. Even a  large molecule such as inulin entered the perilymphatic space. Seven days after  the beginning of 3H-mannitol administration, the radioactivity was higher in the  perilymph of the scala tympani than in that of the scala vestibuli. The  perilymphatic radioactivity on Day 7 was approximately 50% lower than that  measured on Day 4 (p = NS). Finally, round window membrane delivery did not  preclude distant spread of the molecules into the blood and CSF. CONCLUSIONS:  Using round window membrane delivery, the perilymphatic entry of mannitol and  inulin depended on their molecular weight. Intratympanic delivery induced a high  inter-individual heterogeneity of the drug concentration within the inner ear,  with subsequent variability of the therapeutic effects.","2003-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","199-202","","2","123","","Acta Otolaryngol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12701740","","","","Male; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Biological Availability; Drug Administration Schedule; Sensitivity and Specificity; Probability; Guinea Pigs; Administration, Topical; Inulin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Mannitol/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Perilymph/*drug effects/metabolism; Radioisotopes; Round Window, Ear/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drug loading stabilized the micelles against the acidic hydrolysis.  From transport studies on Caco-2 cells, resulted that INVITESA nanomicelles cross  the cellular monolayer but are actively re-transported in the secretory  (basolateral-apical) direction when loaded in apical side.

The chemical modification leads to a reduction in enzymatic  degradability by inulinase and esterase, enzymes which can be expressed by the  colon microbiota. Acetylated inulin was only hydrolyzed to fructose units up to  DS of 1.3. Microparticles made of native inulin and acetylated inulin (DS 1.8)  were loaded with the colon-specific drug mesalamine by spray drying.

Subsequently, a tablet formulation composed of a  mixture of the solid dispersions, Ac-Di-Sol(®), mannitol, Avicel(®) PH-101 and  sodium stearyl fumarate was optimized concerning drug load in the solid  dispersions and the type of carrier. Tablet weight was kept constant at 75 mg by  adjusting the amount of Avicel(®) PH-101. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)  and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) results indicated the absence of the drug in  the crystalline state, which was confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy  (SEM). These results suggest that tacrolimus incorporated in all of the solid  dispersions was fully amorphous.

In this population, the  most commonly used plasma creatinine (PCr)-based or cystatin C (CystC)-based  GFR-predicting formulas may underperform (e.g., corticosteroids and trimethoprim  may affect PCr concentration, whereas prednisone and calcineurin inhibitors may  affect CystC concentration). This study evaluated the performance of six formulas  in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &  MEASUREMENTS: The study used PCr-based formulas (bedside Schwartz,  Schwartz-Lyon), CystC-based formulas (Hoek, Filler), and combined PCr-CystC-based  formulas (CKD in Children [CKiD] 2012 and Zappitelli). The performance of these  formulas was compared using inulin clearance as reference and assessed according  to CKD stages in a historical cohort that included 73 pediatric kidney transplant  recipients (199 measurements). The ability of the formulas to identify GFRs<60,  <75, and <90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) was assessed. RESULTS: At measured GFR (mGFR)  ≥90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (nine patients; 23 measurements), the Zappitelli formula  had the highest 30% accuracy (P30) (95% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 87% to  100%]) and the bedside Schwartz had the highest 10% accuracy (P10) (56% [95% CI,  32% to 72%]). At mGFR≥60 and <90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (22 patients; 91  measurements), all formulas had P30 values >80%. However, only the CKiD 2012  formula had a P10 value >50%. At mGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (42 patients; 85  measurements), the CKiD 2012 and Schwartz-Lyon formulas had the highest P10 (45%  [95% CI, 34% to 55%] and 43% [95% CI, 33% to 54%]) and P30 (90% [95% CI, 84% to  97%] and 91% [95% CI, 86% to 98%]). All studied equations except Hoek and Filler  had areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves significantly >90%  in discriminating patients with renal dysfunction at various CKD stages (GFR<60,  <75, and <90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric kidney transplant  recipients, the CKiD 2012 formula had the best performance at mGFRs<90 ml/min per  1.73 m(2).

SEM and TEM images clearly revealed the spherical shapes of LNPs and QIn-LNPs,  and QIn covered the LNPs completely. The cumulative release measurements of Cur  and Ptx from CurPtx-QIn-LNPs, along with the kinetic studies, showed a  significant decrease in the release period of drug molecules with the effect of  the coating.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional animal care  and use committee. Inulin clearance was measured in nine pigs (18 kidneys) and  compared with single-kidney GFR assessed from renal time-attenuation curves  (TACs) obtained with EB CT before and after infusion of the vasodilator  acetylcholine. CT-derived GFR was calculated with the original and modified  Patlak methods and with previously validated extended gamma variate modeling of  first-pass cortical TACs. Statistical analysis was performed to assess  correlation between CT methods and inulin clearance for estimation of GFR with  least-squares regression analysis and Bland-Altman graphical representation.  Comparisons within groups were performed with a paired t test. RESULTS: GFR  assessed with the original Patlak method indicated poor correlation with inulin  clearance, whereas GFR assessed with the modified Patlak method (P < .001, r =  0.75) and with gamma variate modeling (P < .001, r = 0.79) correlated  significantly with inulin clearance and indicated an increase in response to  acetylcholine.

METHODS: Ten  male participants classified as at higher risk of cardiovascular disease [mean  (SD) body mass index 30.2 (3) kg m(-2) , mean (SD) waist circumference  106.4 (7) cm, mean (SD) age 39.8 (9) years] were recruited to a randomised,  controlled, cross-over study comparing the consumption of bespoke bread rolls  containing either inulin, wheat germ or refined grain (control) (15 g day(-1) )  for 4 weeks with a 4-week washout period between each regime. At the end of each  regime, participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), measures of  pulse wave velocity (PWV), 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP), plasma lipid  status and markers of glucose control. RESULTS: There was no difference in  measures of glucose control, lipid status, 24-h AMBP or PWV after the  intervention periods and no changes compared to baseline. There was no  significant difference between OGTT glucose and insulin time profiles; however,  there was a significant difference in area under the curves between the wheat  fibre and control interventions when comparing change from baseline (control  +10.2%, inulin +4.3%, wheat fibre -2.5%; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Only limited  differences between the interventions were identified, perhaps as a consequence  of the amount of fibre used and intervention length. The wheat germ intervention  resulted in a significant reduction in glucose area under the curve, suggesting  that this fibre may aid glucose control.","2015-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","476-485","","5","28","","J Hum Nutr Diet","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24919604","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers/blood; humans; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Body Mass Index; *Diet; Lipids/blood; cardiovascular disease; Overweight; Obesity/*blood/complications; arterial stiffness; *Feeding Behavior; Bread; Edible Grain; Dietary Fiber/*pharmacology; inulin; Inulin/*pharmacology; *Triticum; Cardiovascular Diseases/*blood/etiology/prevention & control; dietary intervention; fibre; glucose control; lipid status; wheat germ; whole grain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition","","0148-6071","10.1177/014860710803200163","","BACKGROUND: Chronic pancreatic exocrine insufficiency results in maldigestion. As a result, increased amounts of undigested nutrients reach the colon, providing  more substrate for bacterial fermentation to produce short-chain fatty acids,  which could therefore provide additional energy supplement. METHODS: This study  aimed to assess carbohydrate malabsorption in patients with chronic pancreatic  exocrine insufficiency after ingestion of a standard diet and to calculate energy  salvaged by colonic bacterial metabolism. A 72-hour stool collection was done on  10 adult patients receiving a 3-day standard diet containing 100 g fat, 329 g  carbohydrate, and 154 g protein, and short-chain fatty acids, fat, carbohydrate,  and nitrogen excretion were assessed. A breath hydrogen test after ingestion of  200 g (dry weight) cooked maize meal (test meal) and 10 g oral inulin (standard),  respectively, was subsequently done on the patients and 15 healthy adult  controls. RESULTS: Breath hydrogen production after ingestion of maize meal and  inulin, respectively, and calculated carbohydrate malabsorption were  significantly greater in patients (21.4% +/- 17%) than in controls (10.2 +/-  1.4%; p < .05). Patients malabsorbed 70.4 g/d (281.6 kcal) carbohydrate in the  standard diet. Total carbohydrate loss in stool amounted to 8.1 g/d (2.4%), and  62.3 g/d (19%) was hence salvaged as short-chain fatty acids for energy  provision. Colonic bacterial fermentation therefore converted 88.5% of  malabsorbed carbohydrate to short-chain fatty acids, 92.8% of which was absorbed  and 7.2% excreted. This suggests that 10.2% of energy expenditure/requirement in  these patients is derived from salvage of malabsorbed carbohydrate. CONCLUSIONS:  Colonic bacterial metabolism is a significant source of energy salvage in  patients with pancreatic enzyme deficiency.","2008-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","63-71","","1","32","","JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18165449","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Breath Tests; Chronic Disease; Intestinal Absorption/physiology; Feces/*chemistry; Dietary Carbohydrates/*metabolism; Fermentation; Bacteria, Anaerobic/*metabolism; Colon/*metabolism/*microbiology; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/*metabolism/physiopathology; Fatty Acids, Volatile/biosynthesis; Inulin/pharmacology; Malabsorption Syndromes/metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clearances of  inulin (Cin), para-amino-hippuric acid (CPAH), sodium (CNa), and lithium (CLi)  were measured in four 60-min clearance periods (periods I, II, III and IV) during  isoinsulinaemia with lipid emulsion infusion (study 1), a hyperinsulinaemic  isoglycaemic clamp with Intralipid infusion (study 2), and during time-controlled  isoinsulinaemia (study 3). We found that Cin, CPAH and filtration fraction were  comparable in IDDM and control subjects, whereas CNa was decreased in diabetic  subjects (2.01 +/- 1.11 vs 3.03 +/- 1.32 ml/min; p < 0.05) due to elevations of  proximal tubular fractional and absolute reabsorptions of sodium (p < 0.05).  Insulin infusion did not affect Cin, increased CPAH (p < 0.05) and, consequently,  lowered the filtration fraction (p < 0.01) in both groups. While acute  hyperinsulinaemia resulted in increases in distal tubular fractional and absolute  reabsorptions of sodium (p < 0.01) contributing to a fall in CNa (p < 0.01) in  control subjects, in diabetic subjects the sodium-retaining effect of insulin was  not significant. The lipid emulsion did not alter any of the estimated  parameters. We conclude that IDDM without microalbuminuria is associated with a  tendency to sodium retention which is not aggravated by insulin when compared to  control subjects. Acutely induced hypertriglyceridaemia does not alter renal  haemodynamics or renal sodium handling.","1996-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1074-1082","","9","39","","Diabetologia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8877292","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Reference Values; Infusions, Intravenous; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Glucose Clamp Technique; Triglycerides/blood; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/blood; Blood Glucose/drug effects/metabolism; Hemodynamics/*drug effects; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Renal Circulation/*drug effects; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood/*physiopathology/urine; Fat Emulsions, Intravenous/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Glycated Hemoglobin/analysis; Inulin/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/physiology/physiopathology; Kidney/blood supply/drug effects/*physiopathology; Sodium/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relative to inulin, epinephrine effluxed much more rapidly from  liposomes and disappeared more rapidly from the tear pool. As a result, liposomes  were found to exert opposite effects on the ocular uptake of epinephrine and  inulin. Over a period of 45 minutes, the concentration of epinephrine in the eye  was 1.5 - 3 times lower when presented in liposomes than in aqueous solutions.  This contrasted with the 3 to 15 fold increase in inulin concentration in the eye  from liposomal preparations of the compound. Specifically, much of the increase  in inulin concentration in the cornea can be attributed to an increase seen in  the epithelium. Despite elevated inulin concentrations in the ocular tissues it  bathes, the aqueous humor was devoid of inulin unless the corneal epithelium was  physically removed prior to topical dosing. Collectively, these findings suggest  that both the manner in which an entrapped compound interacts with the  constituents of liposomes and the manner in which liposomes interact with the  absorptive surfaces of the eye can significantly influence its pharmacokinetics  in the eye.","1982","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","377-386","","6","2","","Curr Eye Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 7188304","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Liposomes/*administration & dosage; Cornea/analysis; Epinephrine/*analysis; Eye/*analysis; Inulin/*analysis; Tears/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intestinal segments reabsorb urinary solutes, including urea and  creatinine, complicating these methods of assessing renal function. This study  employs a canine model in which urinary clearances of urea, creatinine and inulin  are determined through a normal renal unit and ureter and compared with the  contralateral renal unit which has had its ureter replaced by a segment of ileum.  Urea, creatinine and inulin are reabsorbed by the ileal segment. Reabsorption of  each of these solutes is dependent on urinary flow. The clearance of these  solutes through the renal unit with the interposed ileal ureter approaches that  of the contralateral renal unit under maximal degrees of diuresis. Creatinine and  inulin clearances obtained during diuretic states give the most accurate  indication of true renal function. These solutes are reabsorbed to a lesser  extent than urea. Diuresis minimizes reabsorption of all these solutes by the  ileal segment. Urine concentration does not reflect distal tubule function since  the ileal segment reabsorbs urinary solutes and is freely permeable to water.","1985-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","517-520","","3","133","","J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3974007","","","","Female; Animals; Intestinal Absorption; Dogs; Osmolar Concentration; Kidney Function Tests; Creatinine/metabolism; Ileum/*metabolism; Urea/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Kidney/*physiology; Urodynamics; Urinary Diversion/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test these hypotheses, techniques for the clearance  of inulin (Cin) and p-aminohippurate (Cpah) were used to assess renal function  and hemodynamic measurements in patients with mild and moderate normal-renin and  low-renin essential hypertension and in age-matched normotensive subjects. In our  study, compared with age-matched control subjects, normal-renin hypertensive  subjects younger than 42 years with basal diastolic BPs less than 100 mm Hg had  normal glomerular filtration (Cin) and effective renal plasma flow (Cpah),  filtration fraction (Cin/Cpah), and renal blood flow (Cpah/1-hematocrit value).  The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal vascular resistance (MAP/renal blood  flow) were increased. In contrast, compared with age-matched control subjects,  normal-renin hypertensive subjects older than 42 years with basal diastolic BPs  less than 100 mm Hg and greater than 100 mm Hg had a decreased Cpah and an  increased filtration fraction. The MAP was increased, the renal blood flow  decreased, and the renal vascular resistance notably increased. Subjects with  low-renin essential hypertension had renal function and hemodynamic patterns  indistinguishable from those of age matched normal-renin hypertensive subjects  with similar basal diastolic BPs. These data suggest that in early normal-renin  essential hypertension, the increase in systemic BP is not caused by renal  circulatory disturbances. Increased renal vascular resistance, however, may lead  to subsequent vascular functional or structural changes, ultimately decreasing  effective renal plasma flow but at a rate disproportionate to the glomerular  filtration rate.","1982-07","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1317-1323","","7","142","","Arch Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7046671","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney/*physiopathology; Hypertension/*physiopathology; Vascular Resistance; p-Aminohippuric Acid/metabolism; Renal Circulation; Aldosterone/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Renin/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AIM: To restore serum Mg(2+) concentrations in PPI-induced  hypomagnesaemia patients by dietary supplementation with inulin fibres. METHODS:  Eleven patients with PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia and 10 controls were treated  with inulin (20 g/day).

RESULTS: Inulin  significantly enhanced serum Mg(2+) levels from 0.60 to 0.68 mmol/L in  PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia patients, and from 0.84 to 0.93 mmol/L in controls.  As a consequence 24 h urinary Mg(2+) excretion was significantly increased in  patients with PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia (0.3-2.2 mmol/day).

Although OX is produced by both mother and fetus, concentrations are higher in umbilical than  maternal blood. In addition, umbilical artery OX concentrations (15-40 pg/ml) are  higher than umbilical vein (4-12 pg/ml) and maternal (1-10 pg/ml) concentrations.  The umbilical A-V difference suggests that placental uptake and transport may be  one path from fetal (F) to maternal (M) circulation. However, this difference may  also reflect placental oxytocinase activity, which is known to metabolize  biologically active peptides such as OX. We have investigated placental transport  of OX from F to M and M to F circulation using in vitro dually perfused isolated  cotyledons from term human placenta. Term human placentae from uncomplicated  pregnancies were obtained immediately after delivery. A single peripheral  cotyledon and corresponding lobule was cannulated and perfused. After  stabilization and demonstration of adequate M to F perfusion-perfusion overlap,  we studied the transport of OX (3H) with 14C-inulin (14C-IN) as permeability  reference in both M to F (n = 8) and F to M (n = 6) directions during 2 h of  perfusion. In addition to the higher tissue uptake observed in M to F than F to M  transport direction as measured by the drop in the concentration of both 3H-OX  and 14C-IN in the circuits in which both compounds were added, the same trend was  found for the transfer rates of both compounds. These transfer rates which  reflect the permeability of placental tissue to OX and IN were 15.17 +/- 2.79  (mean +/- SD) and 6.28 +/- 0.93 microliters/min/g (M to F) and 11.79 +/- 1.77 and  4.91 +/- 0.81 microliters/min/g (F to M). Although the permeability of both  compounds is higher in the M to F than in the F to M transport direction,  comparing these permeability values with respect to their molecular weight (MW)  showed a significant correlation when known permeability values of polar  compounds between MW 60 and 68,000 daltons were included. This correlation  indicates that OX crosses the placenta in both directions by simple diffusion.  High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that there is little  evidence of placental metabolism and degradation of OX over the period of these  experiments. Oxytocin is the main therapeutic drug that is frequently used in  obstetrics for the induction of labor and parturition. Under such circumstances  and with respect to the placental permeability results, oxytocin could reach the  fetal circulation.","1996-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","245-255","","5","5","","J Matern Fetal Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8930795","","","","Humans; Female; Tritium; In Vitro Techniques; Time Factors; Reference Standards; Carbon Radioisotopes; Permeability; Biological Transport; Pregnancy; Molecular Weight; Oxygen/metabolism; Inulin/analysis/pharmacokinetics; Maternal-Fetal Exchange/*physiology; Oxytocin/analysis/*pharmacokinetics; Perfusion/instrumentation/methods; Placenta/*metabolism/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  present work focuses on the synthesis, characterization and potential biomedical  applications of self-assembled polysaccharide-based materials. We demonstrated  that the synthesized amphiphilic inulin self-assembled in aqueous medium into  nanostructures with average size in the range of 146-486nm and encapsulated  hydrophobic therapeutic molecule, ornidazole. Hydrophophic dehydropeptide was  conjugated with inulin via a biocompatible ester linkage. Dehydrophenylalanine,  an unusual amino acid, was incorporated in the peptide to make it stable at a  broader range of pH as well as against proteases. The resulting core-shell type  of nanostructures could encapsulate ornidazole in the hydrophobic core and  released it in a controlled fashion. By taking the advantage of inulin, which  gets degraded in the colon by colonic bacteria, the effect of enzyme, inulinase,  present in the microflora of the large intestine, on inulin-peptide degradation  followed by drug release has been studied.

There was no significant  difference in solubility of the particles, but the wettability was improved on  addition of the polysaccharides. The size of the oligofructose chains favored the  adsorption of water. Prebiotic biopolymers reduced thermal and chemical stability  of the encapsulated oil. Microparticles produced with WPI showed a higher  bioactive compound release rate, mainly due to its structural properties, that  enabled rapid diffusion of oil through the pores.

The aim of this study was to develop  a readily accessible microdialysis (MD) method for antibiotic drug quantification  in PELF of pigs. The fluoroquinolone danofloxacin was administered to  anaesthetized pigs allocated to three groups: intravenous injection, intravenous  infusion and intramuscular injection. MD probes were guided through a  tracheostomy into the distal bronchioles using an insertion tube. Intravenously  administered inulin served as a marker of extracellular fluid contamination of  PELF. Concentrations of free drug in MD fractions were compared to total and  non-protein-bound drug concentrations in plasma. Rising and declining  danofloxacin plasma concentrations were rapidly reflected in PELF, suggesting an  efficient drug transport across the blood bronchial barrier. The AUC FREE DRUG  PELF /AUC FREE DRUG PLASMA ratio was 1.8 (S.D. 0.4, 95% CL 1.4-2.3). Although the  probes were placed without fiberscopic or other special equipment, the  danofloxacin concentrations in PELF were consistent within the different  administration groups. The described MD method for drug quantification in PELF is  easily accessible and provides repeatable results. However, trace amount of  inulin was detected in the MD fractions, suggesting a local tissue reaction  induced by the MD membrane.

Gold-standard  procedures are too complex for routine clinical use. At the moment there are  several formulae to choose from, all said to estimate renal function precisely  enough for clinical purposes. It was the aim of this study to compare the  accuracy of several of these in clinical routine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The  results of inulin clearance were compared with those calculated by the  Cockcroft-Gault formula (CGF), abbreviated diet modification of renal disease  (MDRD) formula, the Mayo formula and the cystatin C-based formula as proposed by  Larsson et al. Included were 189 in-patients (aged 20-87, 40% of them women,  range of inulin clearance 8-244 ml/min/1,73m). In addition, inulin clearance was  compared with creatinine clearance in 142 patients (aged 20-87 years, 42% women.  Inulin clearance 13-244 ml/min/1,73m). Bland-Altman diagrams were drawn and mean  bias and standard deviation of the formulae were compared with inulin clearance,  as were sensitivity and specifity for diagnosing reduced renal function. RESULTS:  All formulae underestimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with CGF and MDRD  formulas giving the best results. These formulae had a mean bias of -16.2 (SD  24.8) and -18.2 (SD 25.6) ml/min/1,73m (2) , respectively. All creatinine-based  formulae showed a high sensitivity and specifity for diagnosing a GFR below 60  ml/min/1,73m (2). CONCLUSION: None of the estimating formulae can replace inulin  clearance with adequate accuracy. In our patients the cystatin C formula of  Larsson et al showed no advantage. But the MDRD formula, which can be calculated  without knowing body weight, is as accurate and precise as CGF.","2007-05-18","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1093-1097","","20","132","","Dtsch Med Wochenschr","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 17492567","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Aged, 80 and over; Mass Screening/methods; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Cystatin C; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/*diagnosis/physiopathology; Creatinine/blood/metabolism; Cystatins/metabolism; Diagnostic Tests, Routine/methods; Kidney Function Tests/methods/*standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the effects of age, cryotherapy,  transscleral diode laser, and surgical thinning on scleral permeability. METHODS:  Scleral tissue from 97 human eye bank eyes was tested individually in a  two-chamber Ussing apparatus with the following hydrophilic radiolabeled  compounds on one side of the chamber: 5-fluorouracil, sucrose, dexamethasone,  methotrexate, inulin, and three separate dextran polymers (MWt = 10,000, 40,000,  and 70,000). Scleral hydration levels were obtained on 20 more scleral specimens.  Additional groups of scleral specimens were treated with either a cryotherapy  probe, a transscleral diode laser retinopexy probe, or partial thickness lamellar  dissection, and specimens were mounted in the Ussing chambers for testing.  Scleral tissue was digested to measure the amount of radioactivity present.  Scleral sections were examined with electron microscopy. RESULTS: Scleral  hydration was maintained during the perfusion. The mean scleral permeability  (cm/second x 10(-6) +/- SD) was established for each of the above compounds. Age,  cryotherapy, or diode laser treatment did not alter permeability or  ultrastructure of the sclera. Surgical thinning significantly increased the  scleral permeability to dexamethasone (P = 0.011) and methotrexate (P = 0.037).  CONCLUSION: This study establishes baseline human scleral permeability to a  series of hydrophilic compounds with various molecular weights.

Cylindrical  discs of poly(bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-propane:sebacic acid) copolymer in a 20:80  formulation were made containing [3H]-inulin or [3H]-BCNU labeled in the  methylene hydrogens of the chloroethyl groups. These were implanted in the brains  of 56 New Zealand White rabbits. The animals were sacrificed 3, 7, 14, or 21 days  later and the brains were rapidly removed, frozen, and prepared for quantitative  autoradiography. Autoradiographs from coronal sections bisecting the polymer were  analyzed to determine both the proportion of the brain section exposed to the  tracer and the local drug concentrations as a function of distance from the  polymer. Tritiated BCNU was also injected directly into the brains of eight  additional rabbits, and local brain concentrations were studied over time. The  results of this study demonstrate that approximately 50% of the area of the brain  sections was exposed to radiolabeled compound 3 days after BCNU-polymer  implantation, 15% at 7 days, and less than 10% at 14 and 21 days. Polymer discs  containing 600 micrograms BCNU generated 6 mM concentrations of BCNU in brain  tissue 10 mm from the polymer at 3 and 7 days. Pharmacological studies  demonstrated that approximately 25% of the tritium label was associated with  intact BCNU 3 days following polymer implantation. Radiolabeled inulin delivered  by polymer remained dispersed throughout the ipsilateral hemisphere for 14 days.  Direct injection of [3H]-BCNU into brain parenchyma resulted in widely  distributed tracer at 1 and 3 hours with rapid disappearance thereafter. It is  concluded that local delivery of BCNU to brain tissue with this polymeric drug  delivery system results in sustained high local concentrations of BCNU which may  be of value in the treatment of patients with brain tumors.","1992-04","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","640-647","","4","76","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1545259","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Autoradiography; *Drug Delivery Systems; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Polymers; Brain/*metabolism/surgery; Carmustine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Drug Implants; Frozen Sections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A  hydrophilic model molecule, inulin, was encapsulated within positively charged  and PEG-ylated liposomes and its release was measured in the presence of  Me(beta)CD after vesicle dispersion within the bioadhesive Carbopol 974P gel.  Freeze-fracture electron microscopy (FFEM) was used to follow liposome  morphological changes when dispersed within the hydrogel. Liposome-Me(beta)CD  interactions were investigated by turbidity monitoring during continuous addition  of Me(beta)CD to liposomes and by FFEM. RESULTS: Inulin diffusion within the gel  was influenced by Carbopol 974P concentration since no gel erosion occurred. When  dispersed within the gel, positively charged liposomes displayed a higher  stability than PEG-ylated vesicles. In the presence of Me(beta)CD, higher amounts  of free inulin were released from liposomes, especially in Carbopol-free system.  Me(beta)CD appeared to diffuse towards lipid vesicles and permeabilized their  bilayer allowing inulin leakage. Indeed, freeze-fracture experiments and liposome  turbidity monitoring have shown that Me(beta)CD behaved as a detergent behavior,  resulting in lipid vesicle solubilization. CONCLUSION: is able to mediate, within  a bioadhesive hydrogel, the release of a liposome-encapsulated molecule allowing  further application of this delivery system for mucosal administration.","2005-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","962-971","","6","22","","Pharm Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15948040","","","","Chemistry, Physical; Solubility; Chemical Phenomena; Freezing; Microscopy, Electron; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*administration & dosage; Drug Compounding; Liposomes; Acrylic Resins; Gels; Adhesives; Inulin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; beta-Cyclodextrins/*chemistry; Freeze Fracturing; Lipid Bilayers; Nephelometry and Turbidimetry; Polyvinyls","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hyperfiltration was defined as:  (post-nephrectomy inulin clearance)/(0.5 x pre-nephrectomy inulin clearance);  hyperperfusion was defined in an analogous way for PAH clearance. Hyperfiltration  averaged 128 +/- 5% [SEM] and hyperperfusion 133 +/- 6% 1 week after  uninephrectomy. Hyperfiltration was nearly unchanged (126 +/- 7%) 1 year after  nephrectomy, whereas hyperperfusion had significantly decreased to 118 +/- 8% (P  < 0.02). There was no significant change in blood pressure after nephrectomy, and  no new cases of hypertension were observed during the 1-year follow-up. The  degree of hyperfiltration did not correlate with donor age. Microalbuminuria > 30  mg/24 h was found in two donors 1 week after nephrectomy (one of which normalized  at 1 year) and in one additional donor 1 year after nephrectomy. The degree of  hyperfiltration did not correlate with albumin excretion rate. In conclusion, no  adverse consequences of hyperfiltration were demonstrable during the 1-year  observation period, but the prognostic role of occasional microalbuminuria should  be further investigated.","1992","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","S156-159","","","5 Suppl 1","","Transpl Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 14621763","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Follow-Up Studies; Blood Pressure; Parents; *Living Donors; Kidney Function Tests; Spouses; Siblings; Creatinine/metabolism; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; *Nephrectomy; *Tissue and Organ Harvesting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 101 donors underwent inulin clearance measurements before and  1 year after nephrectomy. The mean of three inulin clearance values was used as  the measured glomerular filtration rate. Estimated glomerular filtration rate  based on serum creatinine and cystatin C levels was calculated using the Japanese  estimated glomerular filtration rate equation, Chronic Kidney Disease  Epidemiology Collaboration formula and new full age spectrum equation.  Age-adjusted chronic kidney disease was defined as glomerular filtration rate  <75 mL/min/1.73m(2) for donors aged <40 years, <60 mL/min/1.73m(2) for donors  aged 40-65 years and <45 mL/min/1.73m(2) for donors aged >65 years. RESULTS: The  postoperative measured glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73m(2) and  age-adjusted chronic kidney disease rate were 36.0% and 27.0%, respectively. In  younger donors (aged <50 years), postoperative measured glomerular filtration  rate <60 mL/min/1.73m(2) and age-adjusted chronic kidney disease rates were 5.3%  and 26.3%, respectively. In older donors (aged >70 years), postoperative measured  glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73m(2) and age-adjusted chronic kidney  disease rates were 75.0% and 33.3%, respectively. Donor age and measured  glomerular filtration rate were significant predictors of postoperative measured  glomerular filtration rate. The Japanese estimated glomerular filtration rate  equation based on creatinine and cystatin C showed the strongest correlation with  measured glomerular filtration rate. However, the Japanese estimated glomerular  filtration rate equation based on creatinine overestimated the prevalence of  measured glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73m(2) , whereas the Japanese  estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C underestimated it.  CONCLUSIONS: Aged donors might have an increased risk of lower glomerular  filtration rate after donor nephrectomy; post-surgery, long-term monitoring of  renal function is recommended. Measurement of glomerular filtration rate should  be carried out for donors, especially pre-surgery. A more precise glomerular  filtration rate equation is required in the future.","2019-04","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","499-505","","4","26","","Int J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 The Japanese Urological Association.","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 30818421","","","","Adult; Humans; Japan; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Aged; Prospective Studies; Postoperative Period; Age Factors; Feasibility Studies; *Kidney Transplantation; kidney transplantation; chronic kidney disease; Glomerular Filtration Rate/physiology; Preoperative Period; Living Donors; inulin clearance; estimated glomerular filtration rate; Kidney/*physiology/surgery; Creatinine/blood/metabolism; Inulin/administration & dosage/metabolism; Cystatin C/blood/metabolism; Donor Selection/*methods/standards; Kidney Function Tests/*methods/standards; living kidney donor; Nephrectomy/*adverse effects; Renal Elimination/physiology; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*diagnosis/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Nine patients with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (PVT)  with normal liver function and histology were compared with 9 matched healthy  control subjects. All underwent standard measurements of glomerular filtration  rate and effective renal blood flow using inulin and paraaminohippuric acid (PAH)  clearances, respectively. Sodium excretion and renin and aldosterone levels were  studied before, during and after an intravenous saline infusion. RESULTS: At  baseline there were no differences in inulin clearance, PAH clearance, fractional  excretion of sodium and free water excretion. During and after the saline  infusion both groups showed a significant increase in sodium excretion with a  reduction in water excretion, while the PAH and inulin clearances remained  unchanged. Although aldosterone and renin levels both fell after the infusion,  aldosterone levels were significantly lower in the PVT group. There were no other  significant differences between the PVT and control groups. CONCLUSION: Renal  function and sodium and water handling were comparable in healthy controls and  patients with PVT. It is unlikely that portal hypertension alone plays a  significant role in the impaired ability to excrete sodium and water in patients  with liver cirrhosis.","2001-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","61-65","","1","91","","S Afr Med J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: South Africa PMID: 11236301","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Case-Control Studies; Time Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney Function Tests; Sodium/*metabolism; Creatinine/metabolism; *Portal Vein; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Aldosterone/metabolism; Renin/metabolism; *Renal Blood Flow, Effective; Thrombosis/*complications; Water-Electrolyte Imbalance/*etiology/*metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During light  exercise of the forearm, blood was sampled in 2-s periods from a deep cubital  vein primarily draining muscles. The plasma flow rate, calculated as the dose of  [125I]albumin in the injectate divided by the area under the curve for the venous  concentration of 125I, was, on average, 8.5 ml min-1 100 g-1 forearm. Assuming  [125I]albumin is a partially permeable tracer, a correction for extraction of  albumin was performed. This gave extraction fractions of 0.107 +/- 0.015 (mean  +/- SEM) for [14C]inulin and 0.377 +/- 0.033 for [51Cr]EDTA, respectively.

Using a coacervation method, these  biocompatible polymers led to microspheres of about 0.5-5 microm. The  encapsulation of a water-soluble model drug  (E,E)-bis(amidinobenzylidene)cycloheptanone [(E,E)-BABCH] in these microspheres  was studied. In this investigation, factorial designs were used to determine the  joint influence of several variables (drug mass, speed and time of formulation  stirring, centrifugation time) for an optimum encapsulation efficiency. Results  revealed that encapsulation efficiency reached 65% whatever the nature of the  biopolymer, by using a stirring time of 30 min, a high stirring speed and a  centrifugation time of 15 min. (E,E)-BABCH release from microspheres was examined  in an in vitro model. The profiles were characterized by three phases strongly  dependent on the microspheres and the diacid association displayed a crucial  role.

Liposomes were made up  of phospholipids or skin lipids, referred to as phospholipid-based liposomes and  stratum corneum lipid-based liposomes, respectively. A stripping procedure from  stratum corneum to dermis by means of adhesive tape was carried out to evaluate  the extent of accumulation in the superficial layers of the skin. The various  liposomes were radiolabelled both in the bilayer structures with [3H]cholesterol,  [14C]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and [14C]palmitic acid, depending on vesicle  type, and in the aqueous compartments with [14C]inulin. Inulin absorption and  elimination was also evaluated. Stratum corneum lipid-based liposomes could  permeate the stratum corneum to a greater extent than phospholipid-based  liposomes. Stratum corneum lipid-based liposomes could deliver a greater amount  of aqueous radiolabelled marker ([14C]inulin) to the deeper skin strata  (epidermis and dermis), while avoiding systemic absorption and, hence, organ  distribution and renal elimination of [14C]inulin. Another important parameter in  determining the extent of absorption is the vesicle size: the greater the mean  size of liposomes, the poorer the permeation through stratum corneum layers. When  fluid liposomes made up of unsaturated lecithins were used, a percutaneous  absorption was obtained instead of dermal delivery. Stratum corneum lipid-based  unilamellar liposomes may be suitable devices for dermal delivery.","1996","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","95-101","","2","4","","J Drug Target","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8894969","","","","Female; Animals; Tritium; In Vitro Techniques; Carbon Radioisotopes; Swine; *Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Carriers; Administration, Cutaneous; Skin Absorption; Inulin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Liposomes/administration & dosage/chemistry; Cholesterol/chemistry; Palmitic Acid/chemistry; Phosphatidylserines/chemistry; Skin/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rigorous assessment of GFR  requires the measurement of renal clearance of a filtration marker, such as  inulin. This method, however, is not suitable for routine clinical practice.  Labelled compounds as alternative filtration markers provide accurate and precise  GFR measurement, but their use may be limited for safety reasons. Thus  investigators have proposed clearance procedures using minute doses of  non-radioactive contrast agents, including iothalamate and iohexol. Their renal  clearance provides similar accuracy as inulin clearance in GFR estimation, but  the need of urine collection again poses certain limitations to the procedure.  Thus, plasma clearance of suitable exogenous markers, such X-ray contrast media,  has been suggested for measuring renal function, in which the elimination rate of  the tracer after a single intravenous injection is evaluated. Plasma clearance of  these markers estimated by multiple blood samples provides precise information,  but repeated sampling makes this method cumbersome. Abbreviated kinetic profiles  have been proposed to predict GFR from the plasma disappearance curve. The  simplified method that uses a one-compartment model corrected by the  Bröchner-Mortensen formula gives an excellent correlation with inulin clearance  and is currently employed for measuring GFR in multi-centre clinical trials.","1998-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","675-680","","6","7","","Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9864664","","","","Humans; Reproducibility of Results; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Contrast Media; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Iothalamic Acid/pharmacokinetics; Iohexol/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was found that adsorption of  liposomes onto these surfaces was requisite to the ocular absorption of inulin.  Over a range of 10 to 50 microliter, the availability of binding sites at the  corneal and conjunctival surfaces rather than the size of the instilled volume  controlled the extent of liposomal adsorption and ultimately availability of  inulin to the intraocular tissues. The inulin liposomes were in facile  association with the adsorptive surfaces, as evidenced by their low resistance to  removal by rinsing the eye with saline and by the lack of sustained inulin  concentrations in any of the ocular tissues studied. This property of liposomes,  coupled with the slow rate (1% per hour) at which they released inulin, was  responsible for the absence of inulin in the aqueous humor as late as 240 minutes  post-dosing. It was concluded that, for liposomes to be effective in ocular drug  delivery, they must show affinity for and be bound to the corneal surface and, in  addition, must release their contents at optimal rates.","1984-04","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","585-591","","4","3","","Curr Eye Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 6713957","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Absorption; Adsorption; Binding Sites/drug effects; Liposomes/*administration & dosage; Administration, Topical; Cornea/*metabolism; Eye/analysis/*metabolism; Inulin/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology; Tears/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several methods have been used to predict  glomerular filtration rate, however the results have been variable depending on  the population studied. We aimed to compare the performances of 4 glomerular  filtration rate tests with inulin clearance in patients with chronic renal  insufficiency and in healthy subjects. METHODS: Inulin clearances performed in 51  individuals with stable renal function were selected. For each of them, we  computed 4 estimates: the 24-hour creatinine clearance, technetium (99mTc-DTPA)  clearance, Cockcroft-Gault and Levey formulas. Their respective performance was  assessed by correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient) and agreement (Bland  and Altman method). RESULTS: Each glomerular filtration rate test closely  correlated with inulin clearance. Nevertheless, all GFR tests displayed  considerable lack of agreement with lower limits ranging from 15 to 42 ml / min,  for comparison with inulin-technetium and inulin with Levey formula, respectively  and upper limits of agreement that could range from 20 to 56 ml / min, for  comparison with inulin-technetium and Inulin with Levey formula,respectively.  CONCLUSION: The measurement of glomerular filtration rate determined via  different methods shows a wide range of variation when compared with inulin  clearance, which should be considered in daily clinical practice during the  evaluation of renal function.","2010","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","324-330","","3","30","","Nefrologia","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 20414326","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Young Adult; Algorithms; Sensitivity and Specificity; Creatinine/blood; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Diuresis; Kidney Function Tests/*methods; *Inulin/blood/pharmacokinetics/urine; *Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics/urine; *Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate/pharmacokinetics/urine; Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EBCT measurements were compared  with those obtained with intravascular Doppler and inulin clearance. The  capability of EBCT to detect chronic changes in single-kidney function was  evaluated in pigs with unilateral renal artery stenosis, and their long-term  reproducibility in normal pigs was studied repeatedly at 1-mo intervals.

In renal artery stenosis, single-kidney GFR  decreased linearly with the degree of stenosis, and ITC increased along the  nephron, indicating increased fluid reabsorption. EBCT-RBF, GFR, and ITC were  similar among repeated measurements.

Recipients of long-standing  allografts that functioned optimally (n = 16) and living transplant donors  undergoing nephrectomy (n = 10) served as functional and structural controls,  respectively. A combination of physiological and morphometric techniques were  used to evaluate glomerular filtration rate and its determinants 1-3 h after  reperfusion and again on day 7 to elucidate the mechanism for persistent  hypofiltration in ARF that is sustained. Glomerular filtration rate in the  sustained ARF group on day 7 was depressed by 90% (mean +/- SD); the  corresponding fall in renal plasma flow was proportionately less. Neither plasma  oncotic pressure nor the single-nephron ultrafiltration coefficient differed  between the sustained ARF and the control group, however. A model of glomerular  ultrafiltration and a sensitivity analysis were used to compute the prevailing  transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient (DeltaP), the only remaining  determinant of DeltaP. This revealed that DeltaP varied between 27 and 28 mmHg in  sustained ARF and 32-38 mmHg in recovering ARF on day 7 vs. 47-54 mmHg in  controls. Sustained ARF was associated with persistent tubular dilatation. We  conclude that depression of DeltaP, perhaps due partially to elevated tubule  pressure, is the predominant cause of hypofiltration in the maintenance stage of  ARF that is sustained for 7 days.","2002-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F271-280","","2","282","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11788441","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Transplantation, Homologous; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Ischemia/*physiopathology; Pressure; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Transplantation/*physiology; Kidney Glomerulus/physiopathology; Acute Kidney Injury/*physiopathology; Kidney Tubules/physiopathology; Recovery of Function/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, neither the mechanisms nor the rate-limiting  barriers of this transport are known. We tested the hypothesis that the amnion is  the rate-limiting barrier of intramembranous absorption by comparing  unidirectional permeabilities of the amnion in vitro and the intramembranous  pathway in vivo. STUDY DESIGN: Unidirectional permeabilities to 99m technetium  pertechnate or [14 C]inulin of fresh ovine amnion were measured in vitro in a  Ussing chamber; the permeability-surface area products were calculated by the  multiplication of the permeabilities by gestational age-specific amniotic surface  areas. Unidirectional permeabilities of the intramembranous pathway of the 2  tracers were calculated from solute fluxes between amniotic fluid and fetal blood  in chronically catheterized late-gestation fetal sheep. Statistical comparisons  included t -tests, least squares regression, analysis of variance, and analysis  of covariance. RESULTS: In the isolated amnion in vitro, the ratio of  permeabilities in the amniotic fluid to chorionic direction and the reverse  direction was not significantly different from unity for 99m technetium  pertechnate (1.03+/-0.10 [SE]; n=7) or [14 C]inulin (1.10+/-0.17; n=7). In  contrast, in the in vivo preparation, the ratio of intramembranous permeabilities  outward from the amniotic fluid and the reverse direction was greater than unity  for 99m technetium pertechnate (2.10+/-0.34; n=8; P=.014) and [14 C]inulin  (4.68+/-1.24; n=7; P=.025). The permeability-surface area product of 99m  technetium pertechnate (2.18+/-0.79 mL/min) of the isolated amnion was similar to  the in vivo intramembranous permeability (n=8) in the amniotic fluid to fetal  blood direction (1.42+/-0.34 mL/min) and greater than that in the reverse  direction (0.84+/-0.25 mL/min; P=.046). The permeability-surface area product of  [14 C]inulin of the amnion (0.53+/-0.20 mL/min) was similar to intramembranous  permeability (n=7) in the amniotic fluid to fetal blood (0.68+/-0.15 mL/min)  direction and greater than that in the reverse direction (0.22+/-0.06 mL/min;  P=.0097). CONCLUSION: Solute transport across the ovine amnion depends on solute  size and appears to be limited only by the amnion's passive diffusional  properties. In vivo intramembranous transport similarly depends on solute size  but is not exclusively a passive diffusional process because it is primarily  unidirectional outward from the amniotic fluid. Although it is a major barrier,  the amnion is not the only barrier and does not appear to be responsible for the  unidirectional nature of intramembranous absorption. Thus, unidirectionality  appears to be imparted by nonpassive mechanisms in non-amnion tissues, which most  likely includes vesicular transport within the endothelial cells of the  intramembranous microvessels.","2005-07","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","247-255","","1","193","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16021087","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Carbon Radioisotopes; Permeability; Biological Transport; Absorption; Sheep; Fetal Blood/metabolism; Fetus/*metabolism; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Membranes/metabolism; *Gestational Age; Amnion/*metabolism; Amniotic Fluid/metabolism; Chorion/metabolism; Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P.; Drukker, A.","Why do newborn infants have a high plasma creatinine?","Pediatrics","","1098-4275 0031-4005","10.1542/peds.103.4.e49","","BACKGROUND: Plasma creatinine (Pcr) levels at birth are greatly elevated in relation to the size (and the muscle mass) of the newborn infant and remain so  for 1 to 2 weeks. Particularly intriguing is the fact that Pcr levels are higher  in preterm than in term infants and for a longer postnatal period. The smaller  the birth weight, the higher the Pcr. This cannot be explained by maternal  transfer of Pcr or by the absolute and relative (to adult body surface area)  reduced glomerular filtration rate of the newborn. Perhaps the renal handling of  creatinine is involved. DESIGN: In 522 pairs of mothers and fetuses, maternal and  fetal Pcr were compared from 16 weeks of gestation until term. Pcr was measured  in 66 newborns of various birth weights and followed for 1 month. Creatinine  clearance (Ccr) and inulin clearance (Cin) were measured simultaneously in adult  (n = 8) and newborn (n = 20) New Zealand White rabbits. In the latter,  nephrogenesis continues after birth and they are therefore a good animal model  for the study of the renal function in premature infants. PATIENT: A case of a  premature male infant is presented (gestation: 29 weeks; birth weight: 1410 g)  suspected of having sepsis because of premature rupture of membranes and  postpartum maternal fever. This suspicion was not confirmed. Blood chemistry  evaluation showed a high Pcr at birth (0.85 mg/dL, 75 micromol/L), even higher  than that of the mother (0.77 mg/dL, 68 micromol/L). The Pcr started to decrease  after approximately 1 week but remained elevated throughout 1 month of follow-up.  RESULTS: From the maternal-fetal Pcr measurements it was quite evident that  during the second half of gestation the small molecular weight creatinine (113  dalton, 0.3 nm radius) of the mother and fetus equilibrates at all maternal Pcr  levels. The newborn Pcr levels were not only high at the time of birth but  remained so for more than 3 weeks. It was also shown that the smaller the infant  the higher the Pcr levels. The results of the animal experimental data showed  that adult rabbits had the normal physiologic pattern in which Ccr overestimates  Cin (Ccr/Cin ratio >1.0). In contrast, the results in the newborn rabbits showed  an unexpected underestimation of the Ccr vis-à-vis Cin (Ccr/Cin ratio <1.0). This  means, as is explained at length in the ""Discussion"" of this article, that the  preterm newborn infant reabsorbs creatinine along the renal tubule. CONCLUSION:  The riddle of the high Pcr levels in term and particularly in preterm newborns  seems to be solved. Once the umbilical cord is severed, the perfect intrauterine  maternal-fetal biochemical balance is disturbed. Thereafter, the already  transferred exogenous, adult-level creatinine will rapidly disappear in the first  urine specimens passed by the now autonomous newborn infant. A new steady state  is achieved in due time, based on independent neonatal factors. One of these  factors is the unusual occurrence of tubular creatinine reabsorption. We  hypothesize that this latter temporary phenomenon is attributable to back-flow of  creatinine across leaky immature tubular and vascular structures. With time,  maturational renal changes will impose a barrier to creatinine. From that point  onwards, total body muscle mass, glomerular filtration rate, and tubular  secretion will in health determine the Pcr level of the individual. plasma  creatinine, tubular handling of creatinine, newborn, premature infants.","1999-04","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","e49","","4","103","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10103341","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Animals; Rabbits; Absorption; Kidney Tubules/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Infant, Premature/*blood; Animals, Newborn/blood; Creatinine/*blood/metabolism; Infant, Newborn/*blood; Pregnancy/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acute EAE is an  experimental model for demyelinating spinal cord diseases such as multiple  sclerosis. It was induced in rabbits by footpad inoculation with rabbit spinal  cord homogenate, resulting in hind limb paresis or paralysis. Animals were  classified into four study groups: Control, Paraparesis, 1-Day Paraplegia, and  5-Day Paraplegia. Ten microCi each of [(3)H]-D-mannitol and  [(14)C]-carboxyl-inulin were administered epidurally for 90 min. After infusion,  animals were perfused with saline. The lumbar cord was dissected and divided into  11 segments. Compared with other groups, animals in the 5-Day Paraplegia group  had greater incorporation of [(3)H]-D-mannitol and [(14)C]-carboxyl-inulin in  lumbar segment 8, corresponding to the location of the epidural catheter tip.  Compared with the Control group, EAE animals had increased [(3)H]-D-mannitol  incorporation in various lumbar segments. Increases in the spinal cord  incorporation of epidural drugs with EAE suggest that demyelination may render  the spinal cord susceptible to larger amounts of substances administered in the  epidural space. These findings may have implications regarding neurotoxicity in  association with demyelinating spinal cord disease. IMPLICATIONS: Acute  experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a disease model for multiple sclerosis,  increased spinal cord incorporation of radioactive drugs administered in the  epidural space. We conclude that demyelinating disease processes may expose the  spinal cord to larger amounts of substances administered neuraxially.","2002-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","208-212, table of contents","","1","94","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11772830","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Acute Disease; Spinal Cord/*metabolism; Lumbosacral Region; Demyelinating Diseases/metabolism; Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*metabolism; Injections, Epidural; Inulin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics; Mannitol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inulin  treatment of fresh human serum failed to diminish serum bactericidal activity  against DSS and PSS assay strains. Fresh human serum that had been depleted of  properdin (factor P) through absorption with zymosan, was as active as control  serum against DSS strains of S. marcescens; however, PSS strains were killed in a  'delayed' fashion. Human serum that had been heat-inactivated at 50 degrees C for  minutes (depletion of factor B), no longer killed DSS strains, whereas PSS  strains of S. marcescens and the PSS control strain Escherichia coli C were  killed in a slightly delayed fashion. Hydrazine-hydrate treatment (inactivation  of C3 of the complement system) and exposure of fresh human serum to  dithiothreitol completely abolished serum bactericidal activity.  Bentonite-absorbed fresh human serum no longer killed DSS strains of S.  marcescens; some PSS strains of S. marcescens were killed in a delayed manner,  whereas control strain E. coli C was as PSS as before.

METHODS:  Euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp experiments were performed in healthy  volunteers. Human insulin was administered i.v. at 6 pmol/kg/min and insulin  detemir at 60 pmol/kg/min, achieving a comparable steady-state pharmacodynamic  action. In addition, insulin detemir was doubled to 120 pmol/kg/min. Minimally  invasive open-flow microperfusion (OFM) sampling methodology was combined with  inulin calibration to quantify human insulin and insulin detemir in the  interstitial fluid (ISF) of subcutaneous adipose and skeletal muscle tissue.  RESULTS: The human insulin concentration in the ISF was ∼115 pmol/l or ∼30% of  the serum concentration, whereas the insulin detemir concentration in the ISF was  ∼680 pmol/l or ∼2% of the serum concentration. The molar insulin detemir  interstitial concentration was five to six times higher than the human insulin  interstitial concentration and metabolic clearance of insulin detemir from serum  was substantially reduced compared with human insulin. CONCLUSIONS: OFM proved  useful for target tissue measurements of human insulin and the analogue insulin  detemir. Our tissue data confirm a highly effective retention of insulin detemir  in the vascular compartment. The higher insulin detemir relative to human insulin  tissue concentrations at comparable pharmacodynamics, however, indicate that the  lower potency of insulin detemir in humans is attributable to a reduced effect in  peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues and is consistent with the reduced in vitro  receptor affinity.","2015-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1166-1172","","12","17","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26260082","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; pharmacokinetics; Cross-Over Studies; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Young Adult; Biological Availability; Tissue Distribution; Infusions, Intravenous; Calibration; clinical trial; Glucose Clamp Technique; Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism; Subcutaneous Fat/metabolism; adipose tissue; pharmacodynamics; Extracellular Fluid/*metabolism; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; insulin analogues; Insulin Detemir/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Insulin, Regular, Human/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Inulin/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Lipoylation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found no difference in the  proportion of epithelial cells incorporating uridine into RNA in carcinomatous  and normal mucosa, and this suggests that the increased inulin permeability of  carcinoma cell membranes was not due to leakage into non-viable cells.  Experiments with cytochalasin B also showed that increased pinocytosis by  carcinoma cells could not account for the difference. The relative impermeability  of adenomatous and colitic cells suggests that increased permeability is not  caused by increased proliferation. The consistent finding of increased  permeability in the plasma membranes of carcinoma cells suggests that this may be  more than an epiphenomenon of malignancy. It also suggests that measurement of  cell permeability may have a role in distinguishing malignant from benign  epithelial neoplasms.","1985-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","309-315","","3","66","","Br J Exp Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 4005149  PMCID: PMC2041061","","","","Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Intestinal Absorption; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Cytochalasin B/pharmacology; Inulin/*metabolism; Colon/*metabolism; Epithelium/metabolism; *Cell Membrane Permeability; Adenoma/metabolism; Colitis, Ulcerative/*metabolism; Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism; Pinocytosis/drug effects; Rectal Neoplasms/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  hydraulic conductivity (Lp) was determined from the rate of volume flux in  response to hydrostatic pressure gradients applied to either the mucosal or  serosal surface of the pleural membrane. The diffusional permeability (Pd) of  radiolabeled water, sucrose, inulin, and albumin was determined under equilibrium  conditions from the unidirectional tracer flux. The Lp of the visceral pleura was  0.39 +/- 0.032 (SE) X 10(-4) ml.s-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2 and that Lp of parietal pleura  was 1.93 +/- 0.93 X 10(-4) ml.s-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2 (P less than 0.001). The Pd of the  visceral pleura ranged from 12.21 +/- 0.45 X 10(-4) cm/s for 3H2O to 0.34 +/-  0.03 X 10(-4) cm/s for [3H]albumin. The Pd of the parietal pleura for water and  sucrose was similar to that of the visceral membrane, whereas its Pd for the  larger inulin and albumin molecules was greater than that of visceral pleura (P  less than 0.01). A spontaneous potential difference could not be detected across  either membrane. The relatively higher parietal pleural Lp and Pd for larger  solutes is probably due to the presence of stomata in this membrane. These  results indicate that both the parietal and the visceral pleura are extremely  permeable tissues which offer little resistance to water and solute flux.","1988-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","2558-2564","","6","65","","J Appl Physiol (1985)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3215856","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Dogs; Permeability; Biological Transport, Active; Diffusion; Membrane Potentials; Water/metabolism; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Albumins/pharmacokinetics; Pleura/anatomy & histology/*metabolism; Sucrose/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diffusion of nadolol, timolol, propranolol,  penbutolol, sucrose, and inulin was measured across the isolated corneal and  scleral membranes of the rabbit using a two-chamber glass diffusion cell. Drug  absorption across the cornea and the conjunctiva was studied in vivo by measuring  precorneal drug clearance. The drug samples were analyzed either by HPLC or  liquid scintillation counting (LSC). For all the compounds tested, the scleral  permeability was significantly higher than the respective corneal permeability.  The permeability coefficients of the beta-blockers varied in the following  manner: propranolol > penbutolol > timolol > nadolol for the cornea, and  penbutolol > propranolol > timolol > nadolol for the sclera. The cornea offered  substantially more resistance to inulin, a polar, macromolecular substance, than  did the conjunctiva. However, the cornea and conjunctiva offered comparable  resistance to the smaller and less polar drug timolol. This information may serve  as a basis for optimizing the intraocular delivery of drugs that are poorly  absorbed across the cornea due to their physicochemical properties.","1987-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","583-586","","8","76","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11002815","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Diffusion; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Cornea/*metabolism; Conjunctiva/*metabolism; Sclera/*metabolism; Timolol/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in Japan, Cin has not been officially  recognized by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan for clinical  use. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) has been used to estimate the renal function of  patients, but there have been many studies in which Ccr estimates were GFR  falsely high because the metabolism and tubular excretion of creatinine widely  varied according to the pathophysiological state of the patient. In the present  study, we determined Cin and Ccr simultaneously in 116 adult patients with renal  diseases and diabetic mellitus. The clearance study was performed by the modified  Wesson's method. The inulin preparation was FFI-1010 (Fuji Yakuhin Co. Ltd.).  Inulin in serum and urine was determined by the newly devised enzymatic assay  (Toyobo Co. Ltd.), which is specific for inulin. The mean Cin was 35.0 +/- 14.4  ml/min/1.73 m2. The mean Ccr(the enzyme assay) was 63.6 +/- 24.1 ml/min/1.73 m2  and that of the kinetic Jaffe assay was 55.3 +/- 19.3 ml/min/1.73 m2. Mean  Ccr/Cin was 1.93 +/- 0.73, 1.69 +/- 0.62, respectively. This ratio was  significantly different(p < 0.05) in the degree of reduction of Cin, with values  of 2.07 +/- 0.82 (Cin < 40 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 1.64 +/- 0.32(40 < Cin < 80  ml/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Only 8 patients were classified into the same  degree of reduced renal function (the Guideline of Japanese Society of  Nephrology). The findings of this study suggest that the GFR determined by Ccr  could misjudge the renal function of patient and delay the administration of  proper treatment of the patient. Introduction of Cin into the clinical field is  necessary to avoid this delay.","2005","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","804-812","","7","47","","Nihon Jinzo Gakkai Shi","","","","","","","","jpn","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 16296410","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Aged, 80 and over; Acute Disease; Chronic Disease; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Diabetes Mellitus/physiopathology; Biomarkers/urine; *Creatinine/urine; *Inulin/urine; Glomerulonephritis/*diagnosis/*physiopathology; Nephrotic Syndrome/diagnosis/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inulin,  which is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by renal epithelial cells, did not  diffuse through the LLC-PK1 monolayer in either tissue culture fluid or  hemofiltrate. Glucose was preferentially reabsorbed and TEA was preferentially  secreted in both media. In hemofiltrate, LLC-PK1 cells reabsorbed glucose at the  same rate as in tissue culture fluid but secreted TEA at a significantly higher  rate. This difference was related to the pH of the fluids since it was abolished  by correction to the same pH value. For both solutes, the passive transepithelial  leakage was significantly lower in hemofiltrate.

A possible mechanism of this prevention may be the modulation  of carcinogen metabolism and scavenging of reactive intermediates. In particular,  dietary fibres are discussed as potentially protective food ingredients.  Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse if the expression of genes  related to biotransformation is modulated by fermentation samples of dietary  fibres. HT29 (human colonic carcinoma) and LT97 (human adenoma) cells were  incubated with fermentation supernatant (SFS), produced by in vitro fermentation  of inulin enriched with oligofructose. Possible mechanisms of de-toxification  were investigated by analysing the expression of catalase and  glutathione-S-transferase (GST) A4 mRNA and the enzyme activity of catalase and  GST. In addition, protection of both cell lines against DNA damage, induced by  H(2)O(2) or 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), was analysed using the comet assay.  Incubation with SFS resulted in significantly increased GSTA4 mRNA expression,  significantly enhanced catalase activity and a significant reduction in the  amount of H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage in HT29 cells. Our results show that  complex fermentation samples of inulin-type fructans favourably modulate  expression of genes related to biotransformation in carcinoma cells, which in  turn supports the important role of dietary fibres in primary chemoprevention.","2012-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","5379-5386","","12","32","","Anticancer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Greece PMID: 23225440","","","","Humans; Inactivation, Metabolic; RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics; Gene Expression/drug effects; DNA Damage; HT29 Cells; Biotransformation/drug effects/genetics; Fermentation; Carcinogens/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Catalase/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism; Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics; Fructans/*administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism; Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism; Inulin/*administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism; Oligosaccharides/administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this  study we evaluated the accuracy and precision of measured and calculated C(Cr) as  indexes of GFR by comparing their values to those of inulin clearance (C(In)) in  10 healthy subjects and 20 patients with either Child's class A or Child's class  C liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: The accuracy and precision of GFR estimates obtained  by measuring C(Cr) were good in all three study groups. The mean values of the  C(Cr)/C(In) ratio were 1.05, 1.03 and 1.04, respectively, and the corresponding  coefficients of variations were 2.9, 2.9 and 3.8%. A close correlation between  C(Cr) and C(In) was also found in each study group (r = 0.98, 0.99 and 0.97,  respectively, with p < 0.001 in each case). C(Cr) calculated from serum  creatinine by means of the Cockcroft-Gault formula (predicted GFR) proved to be a  suitable measure of GFR in normal subjects and patients with Child's class A  cirrhosis: the predicted-to-true GFR ratios were 0.93 and 0.94, respectively, CV  was 12% in both cases. Moreover, a significant correlation between predicted and  true GFR was observed in both groups (r = 0.73, p < 0.02 and r = 0.69, p < 0.025,  respectively). On the contrary, in Child's class C cirrhotics, calculated C(Cr)  significantly overestimated GFR (predicted-to-true GFR ratio 1.23, CV 20%) and no  significant correlation was found between predicted and true GFR (r = 0.58, p >  0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study shows that measured C(Cr) is a  reliable index of GFR in cirrhotic patients, irrespective of the degree of liver  dysfunction. Calculated C(Cr) is still an adequate marker of GFR in patients with  compensated liver cirrhosis, whereas it overestimates GFR in patients with  decompensated cirrhosis. A lower muscle mass, a reduced ability to convert  creatine to creatinine, and the presence of ascites are most likely responsible  for the overestimation of GFR by the Cockcroft-Gault formula in the latter  patients.","1999-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","341-347","","6","51","","Clin Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 10404694","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Liver Cirrhosis/*physiopathology; Inulin/metabolism; Creatinine/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the direct association between complement action and serum  bactericidal and opsonic activities, inhibition of complement may be one of the  possible mechanisms of action of seminal plasma immunoinhibitory factors.  Complement hemolytic activity was measured for C3 and C4 in serum Neisseria  gonorrhoeae and Escherichia coli bactericidal reaction mixtures with and without  addition of seminal plasma. In the presence of seminal plasma, where there was no  bactericidal action, C3 and titers were reduced to approximately 50% of the  titers in the reactions with complement donor serum. The C3 titers were lower  than in the reaction mixtures with immune serum and complement donor serum, where  N. gonorrhoeae bactericidal activity occurred. Individual human seminal plasma  specimens depressed CH50 activity of pooled normal human sera up to 50% of normal  levels. There were no differences in inhibition by seminal plasma specimens from  normal or vasectomized men. Treatment with seminal plasma depressed the  functional activity of complement components C1 and C3 by more than 50%. Seminal  plasma also inhibited alternate pathway activity. Cleavage of factor B was  demonstrated. The seminal plasma factor which inhibited complement was of low  molecular weight. DPF blocked the seminal plasma complement-inhibitory factor.  However, amidolytic activity for serine protease substrates could not be  demonstrated. It is likely that the seminal plasma complement inhibitor is a  protease inhibitor acting singly or in combination.","1980-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","582-591","","4","96","","J Lab Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6775032","","","","Humans; Absorption; Complement System Proteins; Blood Bactericidal Activity; Inulin/pharmacology; Escherichia coli/immunology; *Complement Inactivator Proteins; Complement C3; Complement C4; Immunoelectrophoresis; Neisseria gonorrhoeae/immunology; Semen/*immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At all concentrations, net reabsorption was observed. At concentrations  of 1.2 mug/ml, the clearance of nicotinic acid as compared to the clearance of  insulin was approximately 0.50. As nicotinic acid plasma concentrations were  increased to 90 mug/ml, the clearance ratio declined to 0.22. The clearance ratio  then steadily increased to 0.75 as plasma concentrations reached 600 mug/ml.  Plasma levels of nicotinic acid in excess of 600 mug/ml resulted in renal  toxicity as indicated by a marked decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. The  decline in the clearance ratio in the presence of 90 mug/ml of nicotinic acid  suggested saturation of a secretory system and hence cyanine 863 and probenecid  were used to observe their effects on the clearance ratio. The base transport  inhibitor was without effect; probenecid decreased the clearance. Alkalinization  of the urine had no noticeable effect on nicotinic acid clearance. Protein  binding did not occur. The data indicate two important points. First, nicotinic  acid is secreted to a limited degree by the organic anion secretory system and is  simultaneously reabsorbed. Second, a homeostatic mechanism for conservation of  nicotinic acid at low plasma levels does not seem to exist.","1975-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","195-200","","1","192","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 235633","","","","Female; Animals; Time Factors; Protein Binding; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Dogs; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kidney/*metabolism; Blood Proteins/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Probenecid/pharmacology; Inulin/metabolism; Colorimetry; Nicotinic Acids/blood/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, cysC and SCR were measured in plasma from  pediatric patients (4-19 years) with renal disease for whom a ""gold standard""  measurement of GFR via inulin clearance (C(IN)) was available. The data analyses  were divided into two age groups: group A (4-12 years, n = 26) and group B (12-19  years, n = 34). For both age groups, the linear correlation coefficient of  [cysC](-1) vs C(IN) (mL/min/1.73 m2) (r = 0.765 for group A and r = 0.869 for  group B) was less than that of the linear correlation coefficient of [SCR](-1) vs  C(IN) (r = 0.841 for group A and r = 0.892 for group B). As a single measurement  for detection of abnormal GFR, however, the optimum receiver-operator  characteristic point for cysC measurement (for group A at cysC >1.2 mg/L,  sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 91%; and for group B at cysC >1.4 mg/L,  sensitivity = 87%, specificity = 100%) was numerically superior to that for SCR  measurement (for group A at SCR >8.0 mg/L, sensitivity = 67%, specificity = 100%;  and for group B at SCR >9.0 mg/L, sensitivity = 91%, specificity = 91%), using a  reference value for normal GFR of C(IN) > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.

To  validate the performance of CT imaging for quantification of contrast media in a  variety of biologic tissues in vivo, a comparison between CT imaging with an  iodinated contrast agent (iohexol) and the reference tracer quantification  technique (storage-phosphor autoradiography with carbon-14-labeled inulin) was  performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six New Zealand White rabbits were injected  intravenously with a cocktail of iohexol and C-14-labeled inulin at different  dose ratios and sacrificed shortly after injection to arrest blood flow at  different stages of tissue tracer distribution. One rabbit received no  iohexol-inulin mixture and provided baseline data. Liver, spleen, kidneys,  testis, and heart were excised and rapidly frozen. Each organ was scanned with CT  (1-mm contiguous sections) to determine tissue iodine distribution.  Twenty-micrometer tissue slices were made in the same planes in which the CT  images had been acquired, and storage-phosphor screen autoradiography was  performed to quantify C-14-labeled inulin distribution. RESULTS: Digital image  analysis of CT images and autoradiograms was performed on spatially matched  regions, and resultant tracer concentrations were compared. Tracer concentrations  were highly correlated, with resultant R2 values exceeding 0.9 in all tissues.  CONCLUSION: The highly correlated results for iodinated tracer quantification in  tissues for CT versus those obtained with the reference technique validate the  performance of CT as an accurate means of measuring concentration of radiopaque  agent in tissue, independent of tracer dose.","1998-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","799-803","","11","5","","Acad Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9809079","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Tissue Distribution; Sensitivity and Specificity; Kidney Function Tests; *Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Contrast Media/*pharmacokinetics; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Iohexol/*pharmacokinetics; Carbon Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics; *Autoradiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new polarographic technique was  developed for analogue registration of ascorbic acid concentration in coronary  venous blood. The kinetic data of the markers were studied in an open-chest  canine heart preparation (n = 17 dogs) during a constant tracer infusion of up to  9 min. Distribution volumes were calculated based on the mean transit time method  of Zierler (K. L. Zierler, Circ. Res. 10:393-407, 1962). The distribution volume  of ascorbic acid (23.6 ml/100 g wet wt) as well as of L-[14C]ascorbic acid (24.5  ml/100 g wet wt) in myocardial tissue agreed closely with those of [3H]inulin  (18.6 ml/100 g wet wt) and [3H]sucrose (22.0 ml/100 g wet wt), as well as 82Br-  (27.3 ml/100 g wet wt). The obtained kinetic data confirmed that ascorbic acid  exhibits the physicochemical properties of an extracellular space marker, though  this compound was shown to leak slowly into myocardial cells. Favorable  attributes of this indicator are its low molecular weight, high diffusibility in  interstitial fluid, low binding affinity to macromolecules, and high  transcapillary (1.8 X 10(-5) cm/s) as well as low transplasmalemmal penetration  rate (3.7 X 10(-8) cm/s).

METHODS: Two SIIC periods, glomerular filtration rate 1 and 2 (GFR 1,  GFR 2) were performed consecutively on the same day. In diabetic patients, GFR 3  was measured several days later at the same time of day as the GFR 1 had been  done. The calculation used a two-compartment modelling system (TCM) which showed  excellent agreement to ratio of dose over area under the curve (D/AUC)  calculation. RESULTS: Twelve normotensive Type 1 diabetic patients (mean and SD),  age 39 (10.7) years, diabetes duration 20 (10.7) years, HbA1c 8.5% (0.82%),  albuminuria 13.8 (15.7) mg/24 h and six controls, age 26 (2.6) years were  examined. Healthy controls showed an excellent repeatability between GFR 1 111.8  (11.44) and GFR 2 110.8 (11.41) ml.min-1.1.73 m2-1. However, in diabetic patients  there was a highly significant decrease between GFR 1 129.4 (11.86) and GFR 2  118.1 (13.05) ml.min-1.1.73 m2-1. GFR 1 with 129.4 (11.86) ml.min-1.1.73 m2-1 did  not differ significantly from GFR 3 with 129.9 (12.40) ml.min-1.1.73 m2-1 in  diabetic patients (P < 0.839). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to normal subjects, in  Type 1 diabetic patients single-injection inulin clearance technique showed a  clinically relevant decrease in GFR on two repeated measurements on the same day.  Overestimation of GFR by the first inulin clearance may be caused by incomplete  inulin distribution in the slow compartment. Diabet.

Blood total solute was elevated within 4 h of exposure to hyperosmotic  conditions, but the rise was attributed to the gain of glucose or mannitol from  the bath and not to an elevation of ion concentration as a result of the osmotic  loss of water. Lanthanum in the bathing solution was able to penetrate the  paracellular junctional complex between gill epithelial cells in mussels exposed  to hyperosmotic conditions but was rarely observed in pond water-acclimated  animals. Colloidal gold (6 nm diam) was unable to penetrate the paracellular  space but was accumulated in endocytotic vesicles in many epithelial cells.

In conscious animals, the dialysate/plasma concentration ratios of creatinine  (Cr) and inulin (In) rose exponentially up to 200 min of dwelling. Peritoneal CIn  was 0.24 ml/min/kg, and CCr was 0.10 ml/min/kg of body wt. The transfer rate for  dipropyl acetic acid (VPA) was higher than for its more lipophilic analogue  dibutyl acetic acid (DBA); the apparent equilibrium of the dialysate/plasma  concentration ratio for VPA was 0.3 to 0.6 and 0.15 to 0.20 for DBA.  Correspondingly, the peritoneal CVPA was higher (0.08 to 0.16 ml/min/kg) than  CDBA (0.04 to 0.05 ml/min/kg); peritoneal clearances were 8% vs. 1.5% of the  plasma clearances. The addition of nitroglycerin, dopamine, isoprenalin,  fenoterol, and nitroprusside sodium to the dialysate did not increase  significantly the peritoneal CCr and CIn during 30-min cycles. In conclusion, the  peritoneal transport kinetics of creatinine, inulin, and protein are  qualitatively similar to clinical data, but of different magnitude. The  efficiency of peritoneal dialysis depends on the lipophilic characteristics of  the substance to be transferred.

After a bolus injection of 5 g of  inulin, blood samples were taken 20, 45, 90, 120, 145, 180, and 240 min  afterwards. Inulin was measured by optimized chemical or enzymatic methods of  high analytical sensitivity to determine inulin at low concentrations. We used  the one-compartment model and inulin concentrations measured at two sampling  times to calculate the glomerular filtration rate from the data of the  disappearance curve of inulin. Inulin concentrations at 20 and 240 min after  injection of the inulin bolus were suited to estimate glomerular filtration rate  by this procedure, resulting in values (y) comparable with those obtained by  isotope technique (x). The relationship to the isotope technique was  characterized by the equation y = +4.80 mL/min + 0.92x (r = 0.97). The  single-injection inulin clearance determination can detect a decrease of  glomerular filtration rate at the beginning of kidney damage, given that our  study included subjects with glomerular filtration rates greater than 35 mL/min.  We conclude that the glomerular filtration rate can be determined by analyzing  only two blood samples after a bolus injection of inulin.","1992-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","403-407","","3","38","","Clin Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1547559","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Regression Analysis; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Mathematics; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate; *Inulin/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In mammals, pulmonary surfactant  protects the lung from developing alveolar edema. Reptiles also have an order of  magnitude more surfactant per square centimeter of respiratory surface area  compared with mammals. We investigated the role of reptilian surfactant 1) in the  entry of vascularly derived fluid into the alveolar space of the isolated  perfused lizard (Pogona vitticeps) lung and 2) in the removal of accumulated  fluid from the alveolar space of the isolated perfused turtle (Trachemys scripta)  lung by both the pulmonary venous and lymphatic circulations. The flux of  fluorescent (fluorescein isothiocyanate) inulin from the vasculature into the  alveolar compartment increased 60% after the removal of surfactant, but capillary  fluid filtration over a 10-min period was not affected. Surfactant removal  decreased alveolar inulin clearance by both the pulmonary venous circulation and  the pulmonary lymphatic system approximately 1.5- and 3-fold, respectively. In  reptiles, fluid flux from capillary to air space must occur indirectly via the  interstitium. In the absence of surfactant, this may result in interstitial  drying, which affects both pulmonary venous and pulmonary lymphatic clearance of  alveolar fluid.","1997-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","R2013-2021","","6","273","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9435656","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Reproducibility of Results; Mammals; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Pulmonary Circulation; Capillaries/physiology; Lizards/*physiology; Lung/*physiology; Lymphatic System/physiology; Pulmonary Alveoli/physiology; Pulmonary Surfactants/*physiology; Pulmonary Veins/physiology; Turtles/*physiology; Water-Electrolyte Balance/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systemic acidosis increases renal citrate reabsorption (decreases urinary  excretion) and hence is associated with nephrolithiasis; systemic alkali  administration increases citrate excretion. We studied the mechanism by which  acidosis and alkalosis alter citrate reabsorption in the proximal convoluted  tubule, the predominant nephron segment reabsorbing citrate. Tubules were  perfused in vitro and citrate reabsorption was measured by use of luminal  [14C]citrate. Changes in solution pH were accomplished by changes in bicarbonate  concentration with constant PCO2. Decreasing peritubular pH acutely from 7.4 to  7.2 caused an increase in citrate reabsorption. However, the change seen with an  acid peritubular pH was abolished by additional buffering of the luminal  solution. Increasing peritubular pH from 7.4 to 7.6 resulted in a fall in citrate  reabsorption that was not significantly greater than a time-dependent fall in  citrate reabsorption in this preparation. The effect of luminal pH on proximal  citrate reabsorption was also examined directly. Decreasing perfusate (luminal)  pH from 7.4 to 7.2 with constant peritubular pH increased citrate reabsorption.  Increasing perfusate pH to 7.6 decreased citrate reabsorption insignificantly  (0.1 less than P less than 0.2). These data suggest that luminal pH in the  proximal tubule is an important determinant of alterations in citrate  reabsorption with acid-base disorders. The effect of luminal pH on citrate  reabsorption is probably due to a change in concentration of the transported  ionic species, citrate2-.","1988-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F301-306","","2 Pt 2","255","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2841871","","","","Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Perfusion; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/drug effects/*metabolism; Bicarbonates/pharmacology; Acetazolamide/pharmacology; Citrates/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Creatinine-E was negatively correlated with  body weight in female sheep, it can be calculated from body weight. The  Creatinine-Clr in ewes ranged from 1.1 to 2.3 ml/min/kg and was highly correlated  with inulin-Clr (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Fractional excretion (FE) of creatinine,  determined by inulin-Clr was 118%. That demonstrate a tubular secretion of 15% of  the total excretion. Therefore the creatinine-Clr may be considered  representative enough for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Urea-FE was  24-50%, and urea-Clr about 50% of the inulin-Clr, that points to a high tubular  urea absorption (50-75%). For that reason urea is not appropriate for the  characterization of kidney functions. Water, sodium, glucose, L-lactate and  3-OH-hydroxybutyrate were absorbed in the renal tubules nearly completely (FE <  2%). So they are suitable as endogenous markers for insufficient tubular  absorption.

Albumin is reabsorbed from tubular  fluid by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The mechanism of regulation of the  endocytosis is unknown. The large quantities of G proteins in proximal tubular  cell apical membranes suggests that they may have a regulatory role in  endocytosis. 125I-labeled albumin uptake was measured in opossum kidney (OK)  cells. This is a saturable process with high-affinity [apparent dissociation  constant (Kd) = 24.3 mg/l] and low-affinity (Kd = 15.9 g/l) components. The  endocytic uptake of gold-albumin into OK cells was confirmed by electron  microscopy. 125I-albumin endocytosis in OK cells was inhibited by pertussis  toxin, but cholera toxin had no effect. Pertussis toxin also inhibited uptake of  [3H]inulin. OK cells were stably transfected with a cDNA for the G protein  subunit G alpha i-3 and transfectants were screened by immunoblotting. Several G  alpha i-3-overexpressing clones were detected. OK cells overexpressing G alpha  i-3 demonstrate increased 125I-albumin uptake, which is abolished by pertussis  toxin, in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These results suggest  that albumin endocytosis in OK cells is regulated by the G protein G alpha i-3.","1996-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F356-364","","2 Pt 2","271","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8770167","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Transfection; Microscopy, Electron; Gold; Cholera Toxin/pharmacology; Endocytosis/*physiology; GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology; Inulin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Kidney/cytology/*physiology; Opossums; Pertussis Toxin; Serum Albumin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reduction in  salt absorption was accounted for by a 3 muEq/cm2h decrease in the unidirectional  fluxes of Na and Cl from mucosa to serosa with no change in the fluxes from  serosa to mucosa. Ethacrynic acid (10-4 M) had no effect on HCO3 - Cl exchange,  PGE1-induced fluid secretion and inulin permeability. At 10-3 M, ethacrynic acid  markedly increased both the serosa to mucosa fluxes of Na and Cl, and the inulin  permeability. Examination by light and electron microscopy of gallbladder tissue  treated with 10-3 M ethacrynic acid revealed large intracellular vacuoles and  occasionally ruptured apical cell membranes. Only slight morphological changes  were seen by 10-4 M ethacrynic acid with no changes in the controls and ouabain  treated gallbladders. The effects of ethacrynic acid are remarkably different  from those of furosemide which has been previously shown to inhibit only the HCO3  secretion leaving fluid and NaCl absorption unchanged.","1979-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","287-294","","3","309","","Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 530308","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Time Factors; Guinea Pigs; Absorption; Body Fluids/*metabolism; Bicarbonates/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Chlorides/metabolism; Ethacrynic Acid/*pharmacology; Electrolytes/*metabolism; Gallbladder/drug effects/*metabolism; Prostaglandins E/pharmacology; Sodium Chloride/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of the theory  concerning fluid and electrolyte reabsorption in the proximal tubule is based on  data taken from in vitro isolated proximal tubules of the rabbit nephron. This  study measured in vivo the rabbit proximal tubule fluid-to-ultrafiltrate chloride  concentration ratio [(TF/UF)Cl] and its relationship to proximal tubule length as  estimated by the tubule fluid-to-plasma inulin concentration ratio [(TF/P)In].  From six rabbits, 19 random proximal tubules were micropunctured and analyzed for  inulin and chloride concentrations, the latter being measured by  microelectrometric titration. Plasma ultrafiltrate was determined by correcting  plasma chloride concentration for protein concentration. The average single  nephron filtration rate was 20.2 +/- 0.8 nl/min. The (TF/UF)Cl ratio was 1.10 +/-  0.03, which was significantly different from unity. Furthermore, regression  analysis yielded no significant correlation between the (TF/UF(Cl and (TF/P)In  ratio. This study demonstrates that a tubule lumen-to-plasma chloride  concentration gradient exists in the in vivo proximal tubule of the rabbit that  is apparently established early and is not correlated with proximal tubule  length.","1982-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F575-579","","6","242","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7091312","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Absorption; Blood Pressure; Regional Blood Flow; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney/blood supply; Body Fluids/*metabolism; Bicarbonates/metabolism; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Chlorides/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we sought to determine a theoretical description of  transdermal transport of hydrophilic permeants induced by low-frequency  sonophoresis. Parameters such as pore size distribution, absolute porosity, and  dependence of effective tortuosity on solute characteristics were investigated.  Pig skin was exposed to low-frequency ultrasound at 58 kHz to achieve different  skin resistivities. Transdermal delivery of four permeants [mannitol, luteinizing  hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), inulin, dextran] in the presence and absence of  ultrasound was measured. The porous pathway model was modified to incorporate the  permeant characteristics into the model and to achieve a detailed understanding  of the pathways responsible for hydrophilic permeant delivery. The slopes of the  log kp(p) versus log R graphs for individual solutes changed with solute  molecular area, suggesting that the permeability-resistivity correlation for each  permeant is related to its size. The tortuosity that a permeant experiences  within the skin also depends on its size, where larger molecules experience a  less tortuous path. With the modified porous pathway model, the effective  tortuosities and skin porosity were calculated independently. The results of this  study show that low-frequency sonophoresis creates pathways for permeant delivery  with a wide range of pore sizes. The optimum pore size utilized by solutes is  related to their molecular radii.","2003-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","381-393","","2","92","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 92:381-393, 2003","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12532387","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Models, Biological; Algorithms; Molecular Weight; Swine; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Diffusion; *Administration, Cutaneous; Excipients; Porosity; Inulin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Lipid Bilayers; Mannitol/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Ultrasonics; Dextrans/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Skin Absorption/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the  present study the clearance of inulin has been compared to the clearance of  creatinine estimated by short-term urine sampling or by the formula clearance in  29 children following renal transplantation. The children, 0.4-15.4 years of age  at transplantation, were examined within 5 months following transplantation, and  thereafter yearly. During the first 2 years after transplantation there was poor  agreement between inulin clearance and formula clearance, while 3-4 years after  transplantation there was good correlation between the two methods. However, the  formula clearance generally overestimated GFR and the overestimation increased  with decreasing renal function. In spite of the good correlations between the two  methods after the first years following transplantation, the formula clearance in  individual patients does not follow the inulin clearance changes very closely. In  conclusion, formula clearance was found to be an inaccurate method of following  GFR, especially during the first 2 years after transplantation. This might be  caused by changes in habitus as well as an increased creatinine secretion caused  by cyclosporin.","1991-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","72-76","","2","4","","Transpl Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 1910432","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Kidney/*metabolism; Child, Preschool; Infant; Evaluation Studies as Topic; *Kidney Transplantation; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Graft Rejection; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics; Cyclosporins/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report our experience of the  first 3 years of treatment in such children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight children  with CRF on conservative treatment and six kidney transplanted children were  included in a European multicentric trial. All children were given rhGH, 30 Ul/m2  body surface area/week, as daily subcutaneous injections, for 12-36 months.  RESULTS: The mean growth velocity in children with CRF increased from 3.8 +/- 0.4  cm/yr before treatment to 9.0 +/- 0.4 (P < 0.001), 6.5 +/- 0.3 (P < 0.002) and  5.4 +/- 0.5 cm/yr, after 12, 24 and 36 months of treatment, respectively. The  height gain after 2 years of treatment was 1.2 SD (P < 0.001) with bone age  advancement not greater than the increase in chronological age. There was a  significant decrease in the inulin clearance after 1 year of treatment. In  transplanted children, the mean height gain was less important, increasing from  3.2 +/- 0.4 cm/yr before treatment to 6.2 +/- 0.6 cm/yr after 12 months of  treatment (P < 0.001). There was no significant decrease in the mean inulin  clearance, but two patients experienced rejection crisis. CONCLUSIONS: A  short-term rhGH treatment may improve growth velocity of CRF or transplanted  children. The possible role of GH on decrease in glomerular filtration in CRF and  on incidence of acute kidney rejection after transplantation remains to be  evaluated in a large cohort of patients.","1994-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","716-722","","8","1","","Arch Pediatr","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 7842104","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*complications/metabolism; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Growth Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology; Growth Hormone/*therapeutic use; Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If so, it  should be independent of molecular size. Therefore, we studied with a clearance  technique the disappearance of intraperitoneally administered inulin and  polydisperse dextran 70 in nine continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)  patients and compared the results with the simultaneously measured appearance  clearance of serum proteins. Using gel permeation chromatography 18 dextran  fractions with different molecular radii could be analyzed. Inulin clearance  (2.94 mL/min) was higher than total dextran clearance (1.30 mL/min). The maximal  dextran concentration in all dialysate samples was found in the 50.4 A fraction.  The clearances of the dextran fractions were the same of different molecular  sizes. All disappearance clearances were higher than the appearance clearances:  the protein/dextran clearance ratio ranged from 0.15 for albumin/36 A to 0.04 for  alpha 2-macroglobulin/91 A. This confirms that the appearance of a macromolecule,  but not its disappearance is dependent on molecular size. It is concluded that  the disappearance of macromolecules from the peritoneal cavity is mainly a size  independent convective process, possibly by lymphatic uptake. This implies that  total dextran 70 clearance can be used for measurement of lymphatic absorption in  CAPD patients.","1990","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","147-152","","2","10","","Perit Dial Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1707684","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Chromatography, Gel; Biological Transport/physiology; Macromolecular Substances; *Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; *Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Dialysis Solutions; Lymphatic System/*metabolism; Peritoneal Cavity/physiology; *Dextrans/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beta-2 microglobulin clearance was 22 ml/min in high flux  dialysis and 37 in hemodiafiltration. Solute sieving coefficients were close to 1  for the majority of the studied solutes in a wide range of molecular weights and  slight variations were observed for charged solutes due to Donnan's effect. The  sieving for Inulin was 0.96 while that for Beta-2 microglobulin was not  measurable due to a large molecule adsorption on the inner structure of the  fibres. The good performances of this membrane are probably due to reduced wall  thickness and a consequent improvement in diffusive permeability to small size  solutes.","1993-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","573-584","","8","16","","Int J Artif Organs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8225648","","","","Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Permeability; Blood Urea Nitrogen; Creatinine/metabolism; *Membranes, Artificial; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Phosphates/metabolism; Endotoxins; *Polymers; *Sulfones; beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism; Hemodiafiltration/*instrumentation; Renal Dialysis/*instrumentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These experiments were designed to examine, under  carefully controlled conditions, the effects of different acute protein loads  given to a group of dogs placed on a normal protein (NP) intake for 4 weeks and  to the same dogs when on a low protein (LP) intake for the same duration. GFR did  not change when the dogs were changed from NP to LP diets, 3.0 + 0.2 (NP) vs. 3.2  + 0.3 (LP) mL.min-1.kg-1. Intravenous amino acid was infused at 15, 25, and 40  mL/h on different days. Regardless of whether on a low or high protein diet, the  GFR did not change. Another set of experiments was performed in another Canadian  centre 2000 miles away. In these studies with dogs on a similar normal protein  diet, a striking rise in GFR occurred following amino-acid infusion at 25 mL/h,  3.1 + 0.3 vs. 4.8 + 0.6 mL.min-1.kg-1 (p less than 0.001). These results  demonstrate, at least in the dog, that contrary to previous reports, dietary  protein changes do not affect the GFR. Furthermore, the GFR response to an acute  intravenous protein load does not depend on the amount of protein given nor the  previous protein diet but appears to be possibly dependent on other factors that  may be environmental or congenital.","1988-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","993-996","","8","66","","Can J Physiol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 3179843","","","","Animals; Dogs; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/pharmacokinetics; Amino Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Calculations were done on the basis of  plasma-water-concentrations (PWC). Elimination of B2M during HF follows first  order kinetics (r = 0.97) and the volume of B2M distribution was calculated to be  17 +/- 2% of body weight. This reflects extracellular volume (ECV). Changes of  ECV in HD were induced by weight loss and further provoked by fluid shifts from  intra- to extracellular volume and vice versa induced by varying dialysate sodium  concentration. These ECV changes were followed by determining inuline in plasma  and total dialysate. Changes of B2M concentration correlate well to changes of  ECV (r = 0.98). Thus intratreatment concentration changes of B2M in cuprophane  dialysis reflect simultaneous changes of B2M distribution volume. This does not  exclude the possibility of B2M generation stimulated by dialysis, but proving  such effects in vivo will be difficult because of multiple variants, that must be  controlled.","1988-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","459-464","","6","11","","Int J Artif Organs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3060434","","","","Adult; Humans; Osmolar Concentration; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Hemofiltration/methods; Sulfones; Polymers; Extracellular Space/physiology; beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism; Cellulose/analogs & derivatives; Renal Dialysis/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the untreated group, augmentation of excretory renal  mass by transplantation into the neck of one pair of kidneys isolated from  another animal caused the following changes in the kidneys in situ: marked  elevation in CPAH, slight decrease in Cinulin, slight diminution of urine  excretion and a pronounced fall in sodium excretion. The amount of urine and  sodium excreted by the four kidneys was identical with that previously excreted  by the two kidneys in situ. In animals with alpha-receptor blockade, augmentation  of the excretory renal mass had the following consequences in the in situ  kidneys, CPAH, and Cinulin remained unchanged while urine and sodium excretion  decreased to the same extent as in the untreated control group. The amount of  urine and of sodium excreted by the four kidneys was the same as that excreted by  the kidneys in situ, prior to transplantation of isolated kidneys, i.e. before  the augmentation of excretory renal mass. It seems that the decrease in sodium  excretion of the kidneys in situ was not due to the haemodynamic changes evoked  by the load on the circulation; it was rather consequence of some quick,  presumably humoral, regulation. The diminution of sodium excretion in the kidneys  in situ after augmentation of the excretory renal mass has been ascribed to an  increased utilization by the four kidneys of the natriuretic factor(s), i.e. to a  diminution in the plasma level of the natriuretic hormone.","1982","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1-13","","1","59","","Acta Physiol Acad Sci Hung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Hungary PMID: 6129772","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Dogs; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/*pharmacology; Hemodynamics; Natriuresis/drug effects; p-Aminohippuric Acid/metabolism; Kidney Transplantation; Inulin/metabolism; Diuresis/drug effects; Kidney/drug effects/*physiology; Reserpine/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 10 patients of 12 an  increase was present, in 7 patients a significant increase of the renal function  existed after the therapy carried out.

One of these methods used regression techniques based on a one-compartment  model, and was found to be a good estimator of intravascular volume only. The  other method was a non-parametric numerical integration technique, and was found  to give reasonable estimates for both intravascular and extracellular volumes.

Previous reports show wide range of prevalence of  GHF in type 2 diabetic patients. This cross-sectional study was designed to  determine the prevalence of GHF at an early stage of DN in Japanese type 2  diabetic patients and to investigate the relationships between clinical variables  and GHF. We measured the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the plasma  clearance of iohexol in 56 control subjects and 93 type 2 diabetic patients  without hypertension or overt proteinuria. We used Altman's method to calculate  the age-adjusted 95% reference ranges for GFR from the data of control subjects  and classified GHF in type 2 diabetics from the reference ranges. Hyperfiltrators  (defined as GFR > mean GFR + 1.96 S.D. of control subjects) was found in 17%  patients (16/93). Other 77 patients (83%) were normofiltrators (defined as GFR<  or = mean GFR + 1.96 S.D. of control subjects). GFR values, both in  hyperfiltrators and normofiltrators, were 140.5 +/- 14.6 and 98.8 +/- 14.0  ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, albumin excretion  rate, and frequency of microalbuminuria did not differ between the  hyperfiltrators and normofiltrators. Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c  were significantly higher in the hyperfiltrators than the normofiltrators  (P<0.001 and 0.004, respectively). GHF exists among Japanese type 2 diabetic  patients with no evidence of overt proteinuria or hypertension. Glycemic control  might be a significant determinant of GHF in these patients.","2006-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","264-271","","3","71","","Diabetes Res Clin Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 16125272","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Regression Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aging; Blood Pressure; Blood Glucose/analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*physiopathology; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Glycated Hemoglobin/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disappearance curve of [3H]cortisol in plasma, after a bolus  injection, was analysed by compartmental analysis using a three-pool mammillary  model. The results indicated that only approximately 10% of the total  exchangeable cortisol was located in the plasma pool. Over 75% of the total  cortisol was associated with a large slowly exchanging pool and the remaining  cortisol was located in a second extravascular tissue pool which was in rapid  exchange with the plasma pool. Two days after transfer of trout from fresh water  to SW, when plasma chloride concentration was at a new steady state, body weight,  intracellular fluid volume, haematocrit and inulin clearance rate were lowered  but plasma, blood and extracellular volumes were unaltered. Cortisol plasma  clearance rate was unaltered but plasma cortisol concentration, cortisol  secretion rate, total cortisol pool size and interpool transport rates were  increased. These results are consistent with an acute role for cortisol in SW  adaptation of brook trout. The fraction of the total cortisol cleared was smaller  and the average time that cortisol spent in the tissue pools was slightly longer  in trout after transfer to SW, possibly reflecting altered fluid dynamics. The  fractional disappearance rate was larger at higher plasma cortisol concentrations  in the SW trout. This relationship is compatible with the hypothesis that  cortisol protein binding protects cortisol from metabolism.","1985-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","57-69","","1","107","","J Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 4045354","","","","Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Models, Biological; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Hematocrit; Muscles/metabolism; Extracellular Space/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Body Water/metabolism; *Adaptation, Physiological; *Seawater; Chlorides/blood; Hydrocortisone/blood/*metabolism; Salmonidae/*physiology; Trout/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this  study was to find a reliable alternative to inulin clearance that would allow one  to avoid the use of radioactivity and problems related to the continuous infusion  of the marker. The plasma clearance of unlabeled iohexol, a nonionic contrast  agent, was used. Forty-one patients (creatinine clearance 6 to 160 mL/min per  1.73 m2) underwent simultaneous measurements of renal clearance of inulin and  plasma clearance of iohexol. Iohexol was given as a single iv dose, and blood  samples were drawn up to 600 min after the administration. Iohexol concentrations  (by HPLC) were analyzed by a two-compartment, open-model system. A highly  significant correlation between the plasma clearance of iohexol and the renal  clearance of inulin over a wide range of GFR values was found. By analyzing the  data with a simplified method that uses a one-compartment model corrected with  the Bröchner-Mortensen formula, an excellent correlation with the inulin  clearance was also observed. When only patients with moderate to severe renal  failure were considered, a significant correlation between the two methods was  found. A further comparison between GFR determined with iohexol and iopromide, a  new low-osmolarity, low-viscosity contrast medium, was also performed in a  subgroup of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1995-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","257-263","","2","6","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7579093","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Kidney/*metabolism; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Contrast Media; Kidney Diseases/*blood; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Iohexol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a study to  test whether PET could detect acute changes in renal blood flow (RBF) in patients  with chronic renal failure (CRF). METHODS: RBF was measured by means of PET  (PET-RBF) using oxygen 15-labeled water (H2(15)O) in eight men with hypertension  and moderate CRF before and 5, 40, 80, and 120 minutes after the injection of  quinaprilat (10 mg intravenously). Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured simultaneously by  para-aminohippuric acid (PAH-ERPF) and inulin clearances before and 20, 60, 100,  and 140 minutes after quinaprilat injection. RESULTS: Baseline RBF and ERPF were  decreased in all patients (221 +/- 20 mL/min/100 g and 225 +/- 38 mL/min/1.73 m2,  respectively). PET-RBF increased significantly after quinaprilat injection (+15%,  +26%, +19%, and +23% versus baseline; P < 0.003). PAH-ERPF did not increase  significantly (-6%, +12%, +20%, and +15% versus baseline; P = 0.15). GFR (50.1  +/- 8.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline) did not change significantly after  quinaprilat injection; however, filtration fraction (GFR-ERPF ratio) decreased  significantly from 0.23% +/- 0.02% to 0.20% +/- 0.02% (P = 0.0004). Mean arterial  pressure decreased significantly after quinaprilat injection (P < 0.005).  CONCLUSION: This study dynamically measured RBF by means of PET in patients with  CRF for the first time. It showed that RBF rapidly increased after quinaprilat  injection. PET using H2(15)O is a powerful method for the noninvasive measurement  of dynamic changes in RBF that remain undetected by PAH clearance.","2002-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","947-954","","5","40","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2002 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12407639","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology; Glomerular Filtration Rate/physiology; Regional Blood Flow/physiology; Hemodynamics/physiology; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Hippurates/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; Kidney/*blood supply/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; Tomography, Emission-Computed/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arterial blood pressure and pulse rate were determined in Pony and  Thoroughbred (TB) foals during the first 10 days post partum to establish  age-related changes, differences between breeds and possible interrelationships  with GFR and RPF. Inulin and PAH were injected intravenously (i.v.) in healthy  Pony foals (n = 6) on Days 1, 2, 4, 7 and 10 post partum. Blood samples were  collected via the contralateral jugular catheter over a 4 h period. Plasma  clearances of inulin and PAH showed that GFR and RPF, respectively, remained  relatively constant throughout the post natal period, and were similar to values  reported for mature horses. The GFR measurements obtained using the inulin method  gave clearance values that were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than those of  creatinine clearance performed in a separate group of Pony foals (n = 7). Blood  pressure and pulse rates were measured using an electronic sphygmomanometer in TB  (n = 6) and Pony foals (n = 7) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 postpartum. There  were no significant differences in these measurements between the breeds, and  both cardiovascular parameters increased during the first 3 days post partum.

Among the factors  that may influence the permeability of drug molecules across colonic mucosa are  their molecular weight and geometry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate  the influence of molecular geometry on in vitro permeability across rabbit distal  colonic epithelia. Permeability of radiolabeled hydrophilic probes with different  molecular weights and geometries across isolated rabbit distal colonic tissue was  evaluated by means of the Ussing chamber technique. The hydrodynamic radii of the  probes (an indicator of molecular geometry) were estimated by theoretical models  as well as dynamic light scattering. We conducted the permeability studies in the  presence and absence of the epithelial cells to evaluate the contribution of the  underlying connective tissue to the overall in vitro permeability across the  colonic mucosa. The rank order of the permeability of the markers was mannitol >  lactulose > polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 > PEG 900 > PEG 4000, which is  consistent with their molecular weights and estimated hydrodynamic radii. The  permeability of inulin, a polyfructose molecule with a molecular weight of about  5000, however, was approximately the same as that of PEG 900 (molecular weight  about 900). When the epithelial cells were removed, for the homologous series of  PEGs, the permeabilities were proportional to their free diffusion coefficients  in water. It appears that for the PEG and lactulose probes, theoretical  estimation of the hydrodynamic radii, which assumes the molecules to be spherical  in shape, provides a good basis for the dependence of permeability on geometry.  The relatively high permeability of inulin seems to be due to its compact  structure. The PEG permeability values in the absence of epithelial cells, in  combination with their diffusion coefficients, indicate that the underlying  connective tissue does not contribute to the overall permeability of these  molecules across colonic mucosa in vitro.","1997-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","747-753","","2","280","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9023287","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Tritium; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Carbon Radioisotopes; Permeability; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Mannitol/*pharmacokinetics; Colon/*physiology; Intestinal Mucosa/*physiology; Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacokinetics; Lactulose/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, the Tmax was similar (cystic  fibrosis, 0.25 +/- 0.12 mg/min/kg; control, 0.22 +/- 0.14 mg/min/kg; p > 0.05).  These data indicate that renal clearance of penicillins is enhanced in cystic  fibrosis because of greater affinity of the renal secretory system for these  drugs.","1993-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","293-302","","3","54","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8375124","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Models, Biological; Infusions, Intravenous; Kidney/*metabolism; Regression Analysis; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney Tubules/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Cystic Fibrosis/*metabolism; Ticarcillin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using both  centrifugal ultrafiltration and gel filtration methods we studied leakage of  inulin from vesicles composed of egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. We  observed that the addition of tauroursodeoxycholate to taurodeoxycholate reduced  leakage of inulin from large unilamelar vesicles compared to that seen with  taurodeoxycholate alone. This protective effect was observed only at high  membrane cholesterol:phospholipid ratios (> or = 0.5). By gel filtration we found  that fractional leakage of inulin from vesicles was identical to fractional  phospholipid solubilization, indicating that release of inulin from vesicles  results from membrane dissolution rather than from increased permeability of  otherwise intact membranes. Addition of tauroursodeoxycholate to  taurodeoxycholate was found to suppress the dissolution of phospholipid from  cholesterol-rich vesicles. Bile salts were found to absorb to vesicles with an  affinity proportional to their relative hydrophobicity, as estimated by reverse  phase HPLC. Adsorption affinity decreased progressively with increasing membrane  cholesterol content. Different bile salts displaced each other from membranes in  proportion to their respective binding, affinities. Tauroursodeoxycholate, which  absorbed to membranes with low affinity, displaced taurodeoxycholate from  vesicles only weakly. Based on these findings we postulate that bile salts may  damage the liver through solubilization of canalicular membrane lipids.  Ursodeoxycholate may protect the liver by inhibiting dissolution of the  cholesterol-rich canalicular membrane by more hydrophobic endogenous bile salts.  Biliary secretion of vesicles rich in phosphatidylcholine may buffer the  intermicellar concentration of bile acids at levels below those required to  disrupt the cholesterol-rich canalicular membrane; thus biliary vesicle secretion  may have evolved as a mechanism to protect the biliary epithelium from injury by  luminal bile salts.","1995-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","372-375","","7","27","","Ital J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 8563009","","","","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Permeability; Cholesterol/metabolism; Chromatography, Gel; *Membranes, Artificial; Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Ultrafiltration; Bile Acids and Salts/*metabolism/toxicity; Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism; Taurodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology; Ursodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intact cells, metabolically inactivated cells, spheroplasts or  membrane fragments of C. albicans were incubated with various [14C]-labelled  compound in the presence of [3H]-labelled water. After separation of cells and  supernatant isotope ratios [3H]/[14C] were determined. Quotients of the isotope  ratios from cells and supernatant, called enrichment coefficients, were  calculated under all four conditions. The enrichment coefficients indicated  whether a compound can enter C. albicans cells, is trapped within the cell wall,  is enriched in the lipophilic membrane compartment, is actively accumulated or  actively exported by multidrug resistance carriers. We used six structurally  unrelated compounds to test our method.

Two cell lines, LLC-PK1 (a proximal tubule-like cell)  and MDCK (a distal tubule-like cell), were cultured on microporous cellulose  nitrate membranes and studied in a diffusion chamber. Dual-label tracer  experiments revealed that inulin, glucose, and para-aminohippurate (PAH) moved  across unseeded membranes with similar rates in either direction. Solute  concentrations in both compartments reached equilibrium in less than 12 hours.  MDCK cell-covered membranes were impermeable to all three solutes, as expected  from a distal tubule-like cell. LLC-PK1 cell-covered membranes were impermeable  to inulin and PAH, but demonstrated a net apical to basal glucose flux of 150 to  350 ng/cm2/min, depending on the conditions. This led within 72 hours to a zero  glucose concentration in the compartment on the apical side of the cells, versus  4.6 mg/ml on the basal side. This glucose transport function was inhibited by 0.5  mmol/L phlorizin. Highest glucose flux was obtained using extracellular matrix as  the cell attachment substrate on the membrane, suggesting the highest degree of  cell differentiation. Based on estimates of the surface area of the normal  kidney, the glucose reabsorption capacity of the LLC-PK1 cell line was about 20%  that of the normal tubule. The absence of PAH secretion may have been due to the  heterogeneity of cells derived from the proximal tubule. Different cell types,  culture conditions, and attachment substrates may enhance the transport capacity  of the bioartificial renal tubule.","1988-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","351-355","","3","34","","ASAIO Trans","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3196532","","","","Animals; Cell Line; Permeability; Cell Membrane Permeability; Membranes, Artificial; Phlorhizin/pharmacology; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; *Artificial Organs; Cellulose/*analogs & derivatives; Glucose/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules/*cytology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that  PAHP reprocessing significantly decreased water and solute removal (urea,  creatinine, vancomycin, inulin) by cellulose triacetate dialyzers (CT190) over 15  reuses (p<0.05) but did not affect the permeability of polysulfone dialyzers  (F80A).

Reprocessing with PAHP alters dialyzer permeability; the effect is more  pronounced for the CT190 dialyzer, but removal of solutes with molecular weight  above 1500 Da is significantly lower with F80A dialyzers than with CT190.

This study tested the efficacy of the anti-inflammatory  cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) in maintaining epithelial barrier and chloride  secretory function in the presence of IFN-gamma. METHODS: T84 epithelial cell  monolayers were treated with IL-10, IFN-gamma, or IFN-gamma plus IL-10. Monolayer  barrier integrity was assessed by measurements of electrical conductance,  unidirectional mannitol and inulin fluxes, and tight junctional charge  selectivity in Ussing chambers. Short-circuit current (Isc) was measured in  response to carbachol and forskolin stimulation. RESULTS: IL-10 attenuated the  IFN-gamma-induced increase in electrical conductance and totally prevented the  IFN-gamma-induced increase in mannitol and inulin fluxes. IL-10 did not prevent  the IFN-gamma-induced abolishment of tight junctional charge selectivity but did  attenuate the total increase in sodium and chloride permeability. IFN-gamma and  IL-10 both separately reduced peak forskolin and carbachol-stimulated Isc. IL-10  pretreatment further enhanced the IFN-gamma-induced reduction in  secretagogue-induced Isc. CONCLUSIONS: In T84 epithelial monolayers, IL-10  maintains the size, but not the charge, selectivity of the epithelial tight  junction in the presence of IFN-gamma. In addition, both IL-10 and IFN-gamma  limit carbachol and forskolin-induced increase in Isc.","1997-07","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","151-159","","1","113","","Gastroenterology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9207273","","","","Humans; Cells, Cultured; Mannitol/pharmacokinetics; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Colforsin/pharmacology; Epithelial Cells; Chlorides/*metabolism; Carbachol/pharmacology; Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects/physiology; Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology; Interleukin-10/*pharmacology/physiology; Ion Transport/drug effects/physiology; Tight Junctions/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this  study was to improve cell adhesion, uniform stable monolayer formation and active  transport function by immobilization of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) on  the culture substratum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polycarbonate semipermeable  membranes were coated with collagen, fibronectin, laminin and synthetic  polypeptide, including RGD (Pronectin F). Cell adhesion and digoxin transport  were estimated using a renal proximal tubule cell line that overexpressed the  P-glycoprotein gene. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Under initial and confluent  conditions, immobilized cell density in Pronectin F-coated wells was higher than  that under other conditions. Transepithelial electrical resistance and digoxin  transport activity on Pronectin F-coated membranes were the highest of all  conditions. This might have been caused by uniform cell morphology and high cell  density.","2007-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","25-33","","1","30","","Int J Artif Organs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17295190","","","","Humans; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Cell Count; Digoxin/pharmacokinetics; Genes, MDR; Diffusion; Oligopeptides/*pharmacology; Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; *Biological Transport, Active; Cell Adhesion/*drug effects; Collagen Type I/pharmacology; Fibronectins/pharmacology; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/cytology/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The GFR is determined  as renal or plasma clearance of an ideal filtration marker which is freely  filtered by the kidney, does not undergo metabolism, tubular secretion or  absorption. Markers that fulfil these demands are inulin, 51Cr-EDTA, 99mTc-DTPA,  labelled or unlabelled contrast media. The renal clearance of inulin is the  classic reference method for estimation of the GFR. This method is however not  practical for routine clinical purposes. Radionucleids have therefore been used  as alternative filtration markers since the 60s. Drawbacks related to radiation  exposure especially in children and pregnant women and the safety in handling  radiolabelled markers have led to an increasing interest in using non-radioactive  markers. The development of simple and reliable methods to determine the  concentration of contrast media in plasma and urine, such as high-performance  liquid chromatography (HPLC) and X-ray fluorescence analysis have made this  possible. The non-ionic low osmolar contrast medium iohexol has become the most  commonly used contrast medium for GFR measurements in Europe. However, other  contrast media with similar pharmacokinetics may be equally suitable as GFR  markers.","2002-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","475-484","","2","12","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 11870453","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Radiopharmaceuticals; Child; Pregnancy; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Models, Theoretical; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate; *Contrast Media; Chromium Radioisotopes; Edetic Acid; Inulin; Kidney/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The electrical resistances, permeability of 3H-insulin and expression  of blood-brain barrier related enzymes by retinal cells was observed and compared  with bovine aortic endothelial cells and bovine fibroblasts. The electrical  resistance of retinal cells rose over the first week of culture, peaking after  5-9 days in culture. In eleven separate experiments (n = 5 for each experiment)  the average peak resistance of retinal endothelial cells ranged from 89.3-186.6  with a mean average of 129.0 ohm.cm2. In one of these experiments, the peak  electrical resistance of retinal cells was 149.0 +/- 10.3 compared with 34.8 +/-  6.8 for aortic cells and 37.8 +/- 3.8 ohm.cm2 for fibroblasts. The permeability  coefficients of inulin were: retinal cells 0.17 +/- 0.09, aortic cells 3.47 +/-  1.58 (p = 0.015), fibroblasts 3.93 +/- 0.78 (p = 0.002) x 10(-6) cm/sec.

In this prospective, interventional study, we  administered L-arginine to untreated hypertensive individuals and healthy control  subjects and measured the clearance of inulin and of para-aminohippurate and a  set of biochemical and clinical variables. L-Arginine infusion revealed major  differences between control subjects and 1 subgroup (group B) of hypertensive  individuals. Group B hypertensives (n=18) had no increase in inulin clearance and  no decrease in renal vascular resistance with L-arginine; however, in another  subset of hypertensive patients (group A, n=27), the insulin clearance increased  and renal vascular resistance decreased similar to the control group (group C,  n=11). The ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in group B showed both an  increased mean diastolic pressure and a ""nondipper"" pattern in the nocturnal  regulation of arterial pressure. These findings in group B were accompanied by  significant alterations in optic fundus and left ventricle hypertrophy and  increased microalbuminuria (all, P<0.05). Furthermore, group B individuals had  significantly lower values of HDL cholesterol and a higher baseline atherogenic  index, plasma insulin level, and glucose/insulin index.

The ratio of distribution volumes of nonfiltered 3-O-methylglucose and  inulin, therefore, equals the ratio of their mean artery-vein transit times. An  intracellular and presumably cytoplasmic volume for 3-O-methylglucose of 0.13  ml/g was thus determined in the cortex of rabbits undergoing mannitol diuresis;  similar values were obtained with three other less direct approaches.  Availability of a reliable value permitted calculation of the activity gradients  against which para-aminohippurate and the neutral amino acid cycloleucine can be  accumulated at the basolateral membrane in vivo; both gradients equal about 6:1.  This finding underlines the active nature of basolateral amino acid uptake and  points to a further characteristic common to the organic anion and the  cycloleucine carrier systems.","1993-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","302-306","","3","202","","Proc Soc Exp Biol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8437985","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Biological Transport, Active; p-Aminohippuric Acid/*pharmacokinetics; Diuresis; Cytoplasm/metabolism; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; 3-O-Methylglucose; Cycloleucine/*pharmacokinetics; Kidney Cortex/blood supply/*metabolism/ultrastructure; Mercuric Chloride/pharmacology; Methylglucosides/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study was designed to examine the role  of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in butyrate-induced intestinal  barrier impairment. METHODS: The intestinal barrier was determined by measuring  the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in a Caco-2 cell monolayer model.  The permeability was determined by measuring transepithelial passage of  fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated inulin (inulin-FITC). The morphology of the  monolayers was examined with scanning electron microscopy. The apoptosis status  was determined by annexin V-FITC labeling and flow cytometry. The activity of p38  MAPK was determined by the phosphorylation status of p38 with Western blotting.  RESULTS: Butyrate at 5 mM increases the apoptosis rate of Caco-2 cells and  induces impairment of intestinal barrier functions as determined by decreased TER  and increased inulin-FITC permeability. Butyrate treatment activates p38 MAPK in  a concentration- and time-dependent manner. SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor,  inhibits butyrate-induced Caco-2 cell apoptosis. Treatment of SB203580  significantly attenuates the butyrate-induced impairment of barrier functions in  the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. CONCLUSIONS: p38 MAPK can be activated by  butyrate and is involved in the butyrate-induced apoptosis and impairment of  intestinal barrier function. Inhibition of p38 MAPK can significantly attenuate  butyrate-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.","2014-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","264-269","","2","59","","J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24625969","","","","Humans; Permeability; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Caco-2 Cells; Phosphorylation; Electric Impedance; *Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; Pyridines/pharmacology; Imidazoles/pharmacology; *Apoptosis/drug effects; Inulin/metabolism; Annexin A5/metabolism; Butyrates/*adverse effects; Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism; Intestinal Diseases/*enzymology/metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/*enzymology/metabolism; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part A, Theory and practice","","0730-0077","10.3109/10641969209036203","","The relationship of body fat distribution with blood pressure, fat cell weight and extracellular fluid volume was studied and compared in 20 obese hypertensive  men and 20 obese hypertensive women of similar age, degree of overweight and  blood pressure level. Body fat distribution, as reflected by the ratio between  waist and hip circumference (W/H ratio), was significantly higher in male than in  female obese patients. The W/H ratio was positively and independently correlated  with systolic arterial pressure both in males and females. However, for the same  W/H ratio, systolic arterial pressure was higher in females. The W/H ratio was  positively correlated with gluteal fat cell weight only in males and not in  females. Both in males and females, the W/H ratio was positively correlated with  extracellular fluid volume, independently of the level of blood pressure level  and/or the degree of obesity. The study provided evidence that the relationship  between body weight and blood pressure in obese hypertensives is affected by the  sex-dependence of body fat distribution with possible interferences on fat cell  weight and extracellular fluid volume. Several epidemiological studies have  emphasized the positive correlation observed between body weight and blood  pressure in many. Many investigations have documented the association of blood  pressure with body weight, weight to height, overweight or other indices of  fatness such as skinfold thickness. However, the correlation coefficients of  these different relationships were found constantly small, indicating that the  relationship between overweight and blood pressure is somewhat complex. In  patients with hypertension, body weight was shown to be strongly related with the  levels of both blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume. On the other hand,  patients with overweight and hypertension were found to be principally affected  by hypertrophic obesity, as shown by the evaluation of fat cell weight. However  these findings were exclusively observed in males. No solid data were reported in  females. The relationships between body weight and extracellular fluid on one  hand, and between body weight and fat cell weight on the other hand, are  certainly different in males and in females. First, in females, extracellular  fluid volume is submitted to cyclic changes in sodium balance involving the  effect of sex steroid hormones. Second, body fat distribution, a parameter which  is weakly correlated to blood pressure, is different in males and females. In  males, body fat predominates in the upper part of the body while, in females,  adiposity is mainly observed in the lower part of the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT  400 WORDS)","1992","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","505-525","","3","14","","Clin Exp Hypertens A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1600642","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Antipyrine/pharmacokinetics; Blood Pressure; Adipose Tissue/*pathology; *Sex Characteristics; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Body Fluids/metabolism; Hypertension/complications/*pathology/physiopathology; Obesity/complications/*pathology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The retinal vessels were isolated by freehand dissection and  mounted on a microperfusion apparatus. When inulin was perfused luminally, it was  diluted to 80.2 +/- 2.3% of its initial concentration. However, no radioactive  leak into the bath side was observed, suggesting that the dilution was due to  fluid flux from bath to lumen. The dilution of fluorescein (81.9 +/- 3.8%) was in  the same range as that of inulin, the reference marker. The extremely low  lumen-to-bath fluorescein flux, 0.5 +/- 0.9 X 10(-12) mol/min/mm, increased by  68% when probenecid was added to the perfusate and by 210% when probenecid was  placed in the bath. The effect was concentration-dependent. When placed in the  bath, fluorescein moved rapidly across the retinal vessel walls, accumulating in  the lumen to concentrations 40 times higher than in the bath. This movement from  bath to lumen, which was much higher (13.6 +/- 0.3 X 10(-12) mol/min/mm) than the  lumen-to-bath fluorescein flux for the same fluorescein concentration, decreased  by adding probenecid to the bath. The kinetics of this unidirectional movement of  fluorescein were consistent with a saturable active transport process. The fluid  flux from bath to lumen across the retinal vessels, which was 6.3 +/- 1.0  nl/min/mm for perfusion rates of 6.6 +/- 0.2 nl/min, was temperature-dependent  and was coupled to the fluorescein transport. Fluorescein stimulated the fluid  flux by 17% when added to the perfusate and by 60% when added to the bath, and  this effect could be reversed by probenecid. Our results showed an active  transport of fluorescein in the rabbit retinal vessels coupled with net fluid  flux from outside the vessels into the lumen.","1990-03-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","471-480","","3","31","","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2318586","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Fluoresceins; Biological Transport; *Models, Biological; Probenecid/pharmacology; Perfusion/methods; Fluorescein; Inulin; *Water-Electrolyte Balance; *Capillary Permeability/drug effects; Anions/*pharmacokinetics; Retinal Vessels/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radioisotopic filtration markers have been studied as filtration  markers because they can be used without continuous intravenous (IV) infusion and  because analysis is relatively simple. Although the clearances of  99mTc-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), 169Yb-DTPA, and  125I-iothalamate have each been compared with inulin, rarely has the  comparability of radioisotopic filtration markers been directly evaluated in the  same subject. To this purpose, we determined the renal clearance of inulin  administered by continuous infusion and the above radioisotopic filtration  markers administered as bolus injections, simultaneously in four subjects with  normal renal function and 16 subjects with renal insufficiency. Subjects were  studied twice in order to assess within-study and between-study variability.  Unlabeled iothalamate was infused during the second half of each study to assess  its effect on clearances. We found that renal clearance of 125I-iothalamate and  169Yb-DTPA significantly exceeded clearance of inulin in patients with renal  insufficiency, but only by several mL.min-1.1.73m-2. Overestimation of inulin  clearance by radioisotopic filtration markers was found in all normal subjects.  No differences between markers were found in the coefficient of variation of  clearances either between periods on a given study day (within-day variability)  or between the two study days (between-day variability). The true test  variability between days did not correlate with within-test variability. We  conclude that the renal clearance of 99mTc-DTPA, 169Yb-DTPA, or 125I-iothalamate  administered as a single IV or subcutaneous injection can be used to accurately  measure GFR in subjects with renal insufficiency; use of the single injection  technique may overestimate GFR in normal subjects.","1990-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","224-235","","3","16","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2205098","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Creatinine/urine; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate; Organotechnetium Compounds; Iodine Radioisotopes; Pentetic Acid; Inulin; Iothalamic Acid; *Radioisotopes; Urea/urine; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*physiopathology/urine; Ytterbium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J.","A culture model of development reveals multiple properties of RPE tight junctions.","Molecular vision","","1090-0535","","","PURPOSE: A culture model was used to examine the development of tight junctions in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). METHODS: Chick RPE was isolated on  embryonic day 7 (E7), E10 or E14 and cultured on laminin-coated filters. Barrier  properties were stimulated with E14 retinal conditioned medium. Morphology was  characterized by confocal microscopy. Permeability was determined by measuring  the flux of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), radiolabeled inulin and mannitol, and  the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Changes in the expression of  ZO-1 and a related protein, ZO-1LP, were determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS:  RPE from each age formed epithelial monolayers of similar height, but the density  of the cultures varied in parallel with density changes in vivo. The cultures  appeared to regulate the permeability to ions and nonionic solutes independently.  With embryonic age, there was a progressive decrease in permeability that first  affected larger and then smaller tracers. Despite a small decrease in the  permeability to mannitol, there was a large decrease in the permeability to ions.  This suggests that in E14 cultures tight junctions discriminated by charge, as  well as size. Although E14 retinal conditioned medium reduced the permeability to  all solutes, it appeared to regulate size discrimination more than charge  discrimination. Despite large effects on permeability, conditioned medium had no  effect on the expression of ZO-1 or ZO-1LP. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of tight  junctions to discriminate on the basis of charge and size is regulated  independently during development. The permeability of tight junctions cannot be  predicted by the level of ZO-1 expression.","1997-12-31","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","18","","","3","","Mol Vis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9479009","","","","Animals; Time Factors; Membrane Proteins/metabolism; Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects; Mannitol/pharmacokinetics; Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology; Phosphoproteins/metabolism; Culture Techniques; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Zonula Occludens-1 Protein; Chick Embryo; Horseradish Peroxidase/pharmacokinetics; Tight Junctions/*physiology; Cell Count/drug effects; Phalloidine/analysis; Pigment Epithelium of Eye/chemistry/cytology/*embryology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, renal transport of organic  anions and cations under these conditions was assessed in vitro by uptake of  14C-para-aminohippuric acid and 14C-tetraethylammonium bromide by renal slices.  Water restriction with continued food intake resulted in increases in serum  osmolality and serum concentrations of sodium, uric acid, calcium and total  protein. If food was restricted in addition to water, only serum osmolality and  sodium concentration were significantly increased after 48 hours. Dehydration  with continued access to food resulted in marked decreases in extracellular fluid  volume, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. If food was  restricted during dehydration, the decrease in effective renal plasma flow was  attenuated despite reductions in glomerular filtration rate and extracellular  fluid comparable to that seen in dehydrated birds allowed free access to food.  Transport of organic anions was significantly increased after 24 and 48 hours of  water restriction, regardless of whether food was withheld. Enhanced transport of  organic anions in the presence of decreased glomerular filtration rate and  effective renal plasma flow during dehydration may promote precipitation of  urates and nephrosis in chickens.","1996","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","138-143","","2","166","","J Comp Physiol B","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8766911","","","","Animals; Body Weight; Blood Chemical Analysis; Glomerular Filtration Rate/physiology; Kidney Function Tests; Extracellular Space; Histocytochemistry; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Tetraethylammonium; Kidney/metabolism/*physiology; *Dehydration/metabolism; *Food Deprivation; Chickens/metabolism/*physiology; Ion Transport/*physiology; Renal Plasma Flow, Effective/physiology; Tetraethylammonium Compounds/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After confluent cultures of  HPT cells were incubated with 3H-labeled folic acid (PteGlu), binding to the  apical membrane was determined by an acid removal procedure, and transport was  subsequently measured in solubilized cells. Although PteGlu binding was almost  all specific (suppressed by excess unlabeled PteGlu), HPT cells transported  PteGlu by specific and nonspecific processes. Specific PteGlu binding and  transport were both saturable processes, reaching maxima of 0.5 and 0.1 pmol/mg  protein, respectively, with half-maximal constants of 12 and 50 nM, respectively.  The PteGlu analogues methotrexate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid  (5-CH3-H4PteGlu) inhibited both the binding and transport of PteGlu, with  5-CH3-H4PteGlu being more potent (lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration).  In contrast, 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid significantly reduced PteGlu transport  at concentrations (100-250 nM) that had no effect on binding. These data suggest  that the HPT cells will serve as a good model for studies of renal folate  reabsorption. Initial characterization of the transport of folate by HPT cells  suggests two distinct processes, binding to a high-affinity membrane  folate-binding protein followed by a structurally specific transfer into the  cell.","1992-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F841-848","","5 Pt 2","263","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1443174","","","","Humans; Tritium; Time Factors; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cells, Cultured; Regression Analysis; Osmolar Concentration; Culture Media; Biological Transport/drug effects; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/cytology/*metabolism; Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology; Folic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Methotrexate/pharmacology; Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PTH also stimulated  renal proximal tubular AC in vitro and increased renal cortical cAMP content in  vivo. PTH oxidized at Met 18 was anticalciuric, but not phosphaturic, stimulated  renal AC and increased cortical cAMP content. PTH oxidized at Met 8 also produced  an anticalciuria without a phosphaturia, but only weakly stimulated AC and did  not alter cortical cAMP content. PTH oxidized at both Met 8 and Met 18 was  phosphaturic but not anticalciuric, was a weak agonist for AC and decreased  cortical cAMP content. In the isolated perfused rabbit proximal straight tubule,  PTH inhibited fluid and phosphate transport, whereas the doubly oxidized peptide  was inactive. The data are consistent with the possibility that the effects of  PTH on renal tubular phosphorus transport are mediated by more than one mechanism  and are, in part, independent of the cAMP messenger system.","1989","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","267-275","","5","15","","Miner Electrolyte Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2554103","","","","Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Rabbits; Biological Transport; Blood Pressure; Cyclic AMP/metabolism; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Bicarbonates/blood; Kidney/*physiology; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/drug effects; Calcium/blood/urine; Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism; Parathyroid Hormone/*metabolism; Phosphorus/blood/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neutrophils incubated with  serum inulin supernatants reduced the dye and showed a general increase in  oxidative metabolism. The oxidation of glucose-1-14-C by supernatant prepared  from selectively depleted sera indicated that the neutrophil-stimulating  factor(s) was generated through the alternate pathway of complement activation.  The possibility that inulun had been ingested as a particle was ruled out by  light microscopy and radiolabeling studies. The failure of neutrophils stimulated  by the serum-inulun supernatants to migrate after exposure to a chemotactic agent  suggested that the site of neutrophil-complement interaction was on the cell  membrane. It is concluded from these results that biologically active fragments  generated through the alternative pathway of complement activation can stimulate  neutrophil metabolism in the absence of phagocytosis. Interaction of such  fragments with circulating neutrophils in vivo and the subsequent metabolic  activation of these cells is one explanation for the spontaneous reduction of  nitroblue tetrazolium dye in vitro by neutrophils from patients with certain  infections and inflammatory disorders.","1975-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","843-849","","6","45","","Blood","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 47770","","","","Humans; Tritium; Oxygen Consumption; Carbon Radioisotopes; Absorption; Glucose/metabolism; Complement C3/metabolism; Antibodies; Coloring Agents; Neutrophils/*metabolism; Hemolysis; Inulin; Complement System Proteins/*metabolism; Complement C4; Immunoelectrophoresis; *Nitroblue Tetrazolium; *Tetrazolium Salts; Angioedema/immunology; Carbon Dioxide/biosynthesis; Chemotaxis; Epitopes; Hexosephosphates/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: High glucose increased the paracellular  permeability of BRCEC monolayers independently of its hypertonic action (5 mM  glucose: 154.2 +/- 21.2 and 19.5 +/- 2.4; 30 mM glucose: 134.2 +/- 5.1 [P = 0.01]  and 23.5 +/- 2.1 [P = 0.01]; 5 mM glucose + 25 mM mannitol: 168.7 +/- 13.7  ohm.cm2 [P = 0.04] and 19.3% +/- 1.2% 48-hour equilibration of inulin [P =  0.008]). In a separate series of experiments, the authors were unable to show  that either aminoguanidine or ponalrestat prevented the effect of high glucose on  permeability (30 mM glucose 95.1 +/- 16.7 and 45.4 +/- 5.6; 5 mM glucose: 122.9  +/- 14.2 [P = 0.02] and 36.6 +/- 5.6 [P = 0.001]; 30 mM glucose + aminoguanidine  87.9 +/- 17.5 [P = 0.04] and 75.3 +/- 14.9 [P = 0.6]; 30 mM glucose + ponalrestat  79.9 +/- 12.7 ohm.cm2 [P = 0.1] and 48.2 +/- 2.5% 48-hour equilibration of inulin  [P = 0.15]). Ponalrestat did not abrogate the effect of high glucose despite its  ability to reduce a high glucose-induced increase in BRCEC intracellular sorbitol  levels. CONCLUSIONS: The data are consistent with a role for increased  paracellular permeability in breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier in diabetic  retinopathy, which appears to be independent of both nonenzymatic glycosylation  and the polyol pathway.","1997-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","635-642","","3","38","","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9071217","","","","Animals; Cells, Cultured; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Cattle; Lactic Acid/metabolism; Glucose/*pharmacology; Electric Impedance; Polymers/metabolism; Guanidines/pharmacology; Carbon Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Capillary Permeability/*drug effects; Diffusion Chambers, Culture; Blood-Retinal Barrier; Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism; Fructose/metabolism; Phthalazines/pharmacology; Pyruvic Acid/metabolism; Retinal Vessels/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism; Sorbitol/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After activation of Na+-glucose  cotransport, the permeability of intestinal tight junctions is increased. Because  previous analyses of this physiological tight junction regulation have been  restricted to intact mucosae, dissection of the mechanisms underlying this  process has been limited. To characterize this process, we have developed a  reductionist model consisting of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells transfected  with the intestinal Na+-glucose cotransporter, SGLT1. Monolayers of SGLT1  transfectants demonstrate physiological Na+-glucose cotransport. Activation of  SGLT1 results in a 22 +/- 5% fall in transepithelial resistance (TER) (P <  0.001). Similarly, inactivation of SGLT1 by addition of phloridzin increases TER  by 24 +/- 2% (P < 0.001). The increased tight junction permeability is size  selective, with increased flux of small nutrient-sized molecules, e.g., mannitol,  but not of larger molecules, e.g., inulin. SGLT1-dependent increases in tight  junction permeability are inhibited by myosin light-chain kinase inhibitors (20  microM ML-7 or 40 microM ML-9), suggesting that myosin regulatory light-chain  (MLC) phosphorylation is involved in tight junction regulation. Analysis of MLC  phosphorylation showed a 2.08-fold increase after activation of SGLT1 (P < 0.01),  which was inhibited by ML-9 (P < 0.01). Thus monolayers incubated with glucose  and myosin light-chain kinase inhibitors are comparable to monolayers incubated  with phloridzin. ML-9 also inhibits SGLT1-mediated tight junction regulation in  small intestinal mucosa (P < 0.01). These data demonstrate that epithelial cells  are the mediators of physiological tight junction regulation subsequent to SGLT1  activation. The intimate relationship between tight junction regulation and MLC  phosphorylation suggests that a critical step in regulation of epithelial tight  junction permeability may be myosin ATPase-mediated contraction of the  perijunctional actomyosin ring and subsequent physical tension on the tight  junction.","1997-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","C1378-1385","","4","273","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9357784","","","","Humans; Male; Kinetics; Animals; Homeostasis; Transfection; Glucose/metabolism; Phosphorylation; Mannitol/pharmacokinetics; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Cricetinae; Phlorhizin/pharmacology; Phosphoproteins/metabolism; Membrane Potentials; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Intestinal Mucosa/*physiology; Tight Junctions/*physiology; Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/biosynthesis; Myosin Light Chains/*metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplement","","0803-5326","10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb02105.x","","Appropriate measurement of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is important for the assessment of renal function. This paper reviews the methods used to assess  GFR in clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with Fabry  disease, which include inulin clearance, 24-hour creatinine clearance, chromium  ethylene diamine tetraacetate (51Cr-EDTA) clearance and cystatin C  concentrations. GFR has also been estimated using calculations based on  creatinine clearance (the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and the Modification of Diet  in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Analysis of the results of these studies shows  that there are striking discrepancies between estimated and measured GFR. For  example, the MDRD equation overestimates GFR in patients with Fabry disease who  have normal renal function. In addition, cystatin C has been shown to be of  limited use for measuring renal function during ERT, because it is influenced by  other factors such as age, gender and weight. CONCLUSION: The use of exact  methods, such as inulin clearance, 124I-iothalamate, 99mTc-DTPA, 51Cr-EDTA and  iohexol, appears to be mandatory for a robust evaluation of the effects of ERT on  GFR in patients with Fabry disease.","2005-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","19-23; discussion 9-10","","447","94","","Acta Paediatr Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Norway PMID: 15895707","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Radiopharmaceuticals; Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology; Creatinine/blood; Feeding Behavior; Kidney Function Tests; Environmental Monitoring; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate; Cystatin C; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Inulin/blood; alpha-Galactosidase/therapeutic use; Cystatins/blood; Edetic Acid/blood; Fabry Disease/*complications/drug therapy; Kidney Diseases/*blood/*complications/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine if excessive activation  of this system might cause dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps in some  patients, we conducted a double-blind, randomized and balanced trial in which 5  patients with frequent dialysis-associated cramps were each given either a 25 mg  oral dose of captopril or placebo 1 h before 8 consecutive dialyses. Captopril  increased the frequency of dialyses complicated by skeletal muscle cramps in 1  patient and did not affect cramp frequency in the other 4 patients. Predialysis  plasma renin activity (PRA) averaged 3.9 ng/ml/h (+/- SD) and was the same as in  unselected hemodialysis patients. Following captopril, PRA increased by an  average of 2.2 +/- 0.7 times, similar to the 2.6-fold increase that was reported  when this drug was used to prevent dialysis-associated hypertensive crises.  However, hemodialysis by itself did not activate the renin-angiotensin system as  consistently in patients with frequent dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps  as in unselected hemodialysis patients and the ratio of post- to predialysis PRA  averaged 1.0 +/- 0.6. We conclude that the renin-angiotensin system does not  mediate, and that its activation during hemodialysis may actually help prevent,  dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps.","1990-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","405-409","","10","28","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 2258248","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Double-Blind Method; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Body Weight/drug effects; Renin/*blood; Renal Dialysis/*adverse effects; Renin-Angiotensin System/*physiology; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Urea/pharmacokinetics; Captopril/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Muscle Cramp/blood/*etiology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was accompanied by a reduction in the active flux that  resulted in a reduced net bicarbonate flux. Perfusion with 0.3 mM H2O2 resulted  in a marked increase in the active and net flux of sodium beginning at two hours.  By four hours the net sodium flux had increased by nine-fold over control values.  Perfusion with 0.3 mM H2O2 resulted in a 16% and 30% increase in endothelial  permeability to inulin and dextran, respectively. Suppression of catalase  activity by in vivo pretreatment with intravenous 3-aminotriazole (3AT) did not  result in an increased sensitivity of the corneal endothelium to 0.2 mM H2O2:  both bicarbonate and sodium fluxes were normal. Inhibition of glutathione  synthesis with intravitreal buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) increased the  sensitivity of the corneal endothelium to 0.2 mM H2O2 only in the case of sodium  flux, with a 4.8-fold increase in net sodium flux at 3 hours after initiation of  perfusion. Bicarbonate fluxes were unaffected after BSO pretreatment. The data  show that ionic and non-ionic fluxes are altered by H2O2, that pretreatment with  3AT has a minimal effect on ion fluxes while BSO markedly alters sodium flux  without changing bicarbonate fluxes, and that sodium and bicarbonate movement are  not locked in a symport.","1991","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","9-25","","1","8","","Lens Eye Toxic Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1710927","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Permeability/drug effects; Antimetabolites/pharmacology; Dextrans/pharmacokinetics; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Sodium/pharmacokinetics; Bicarbonates/pharmacokinetics; Amitrole/pharmacology; Buthionine Sulfoximine; Catalase/antagonists & inhibitors; Endothelium, Corneal/enzymology/*metabolism; Glutathione/antagonists & inhibitors; Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology; Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured bone mineralization and calcium metabolic  parameters longitudinally in a group of 99 adolescents. We found a significant  relationship between calcium absorption and skeletal calcium accretion and the  Fok1, but not other VDR or related, genetic polymorphisms. It seems that the Fok1  polymorphism directly affects bone mineralization during pubertal growth through  an effect on calcium absorption. INTRODUCTION: There are few data regarding the  relationship between genetic markers for low bone mass and changes in calcium  metabolism in childhood or adolescence. We sought to identify the effects of  polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) on calcium and bone mineral  metabolism in a longitudinal study of pubertal adolescents. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: Adolescents (n = 99) received comprehensive stable isotope studies of  calcium absorption, bone calcium kinetics, and bone mineralization. Studies were  repeated 12 months later. Polymorphisms of putative genetic markers were  determined and related to bone mineralization and calcium metabolic finding.  Results were analyzed by ANOVA in which changes over time were determined using  the initial value as a covariate. RESULTS: Polymorphisms of the Fok1 gene of the  VDR were significantly related to calcium absorption (p = 0.008) and whole body  BMC (p = 0.03) and BMD (p = 0.006). The Fok1 effect on whole body BMD was  significant for those with Ca intake >800 mg/day (p < 0.001), whereas for those  with Ca intake < or = 800 mg/day, the Fok1 genotype did not have a significant  effect on whole body BMD (p = 0.40). The Fok1 genotype was significantly related  to the changes during the year in whole body calcium accretion, with the ff  genotype having a 63 +/- 20 mg/day deficit compared with the FF genotype (p =  0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The Fok1 polymorphism of the VDR receptor seems to directly  affect bone mineral accretion during pubertal growth through an effect on calcium  absorption. The relationship between different genetic polymorphisms and bone  mineral metabolism may vary by life stage as well as diet.","2005-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","945-953","","6","20","","J Bone Miner Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15883634","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Analysis of Variance; Time Factors; Genotype; Diet; Child; Placebos; Software; *Polymorphism, Genetic; Bone Density; Immunoassay; Osteocalcin/metabolism; Inulin/pharmacology; Bone and Bones/metabolism/physiology; Calcium/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Fructans/metabolism; Polysaccharides/pharmacology; Receptors, Calcitriol/blood/*genetics/*physiology; Vitamin D/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the cause of acute renal failure in AACS may be  multifactorial, renal vein compression alone has not been investigated. This  study evaluated the effects of elevated renal vein pressure (RVP) on renal  function. METHODS: Two groups of swine (18-22 kg) were studied after left  nephrectomy and placement of a renal artery flow probe to measure renal artery  blood flow, renal vein catheter, and ureteral cannula. Two hours were allowed for  equilibration and an inulin infusion was begun to calculate inulin clearance for  measurement of glomerular filtration rate. Group 1 animals (n = 4) had RVP  elevated by 30 mm Hg for 2 hours with renal vein constriction. RVP was then  returned to baseline for 1 hour. In group 2 (n = 4), the RVP was not elevated.  The cardiac index (2.9 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2) and mean arterial pressure (101 +/- 9 mm  Hg) remained stable. Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were measured  every 60 minutes. RESULTS: Elevation of RVP (0-30 mm Hg above baseline) in the  experimental group showed a significant decrease in renal artery blood flow index  (2.7 to 1.5 mL/min per g) and glomerular filtration rate (26 to 8 mL/min)  compared with control. In addition, there was significant elevation of plasma  serum aldosterone (14 to 25 microng/dL) and plasma renin activity (2.6 to 9.5  microng/mL per h) as well as urinary protein leak in the experimental animals  compared with control. These changes were partially or completely reversible as  RVP returned toward baseline. CONCLUSION: Elevated RVP alone leads to decreased  renal artery blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and increased plasma renin  activity, serum aldosterone, and urinary protein leak. These changes are  consistent with the renal pathophysiology seen in AACS, morbid obesity, and  preeclampsia. The changes are partially or completely reversed by decreasing  renal venous pressure as occurs with abdominal decompression for AACS.","1999-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1000-1003","","6","47","","J Trauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10608524","","","","Animals; Acute Disease; Swine; Blood Flow Velocity; Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Disease Models, Animal; Vascular Resistance; *Renal Circulation; Aldosterone/blood; Renin/blood; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Urodynamics; *Venous Pressure; Abdomen/*blood supply; Acute Kidney Injury/*etiology/metabolism/*physiopathology; Compartment Syndromes/*complications; Proteinuria/etiology/urine; Renal Artery/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These data imply that ANG  II induces insulin resistance by an effect independent of a reduction in  interstitial insulin.","1999-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","E920-926","","5","277","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10567021","","","","Male; Animals; Blood Glucose; Dogs; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Insulin Resistance/*physiology; Hyperinsulinism/physiopathology; Regional Blood Flow/physiology; Glucose/biosynthesis; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin II/*pharmacology; Extracellular Space/chemistry; Femoral Artery/physiology; Hypertension/chemically induced/physiopathology; Hypoglycemic Agents/*analysis/blood/pharmacology; Insulin/*analysis/blood/pharmacology; Lymph/*chemistry; Vasoconstrictor Agents/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question has been raised of the possible long-term unfavorable course of CyA-induced lesions.  Advantage was taken of a large cohort of diabetic patients treated for several  months using moderate CyA dosage to evaluate the long-term evolution of renal  function in such patients. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty five recently  diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients having received CyA for a mean of 19.9 months  were monitored for 13 years, in parallel with 100 similar patients treated with  insulin alone. RESULTS: In the CyA-treated group, a transient increase in  creatininemia levels occurred during the first 18 months of treatment associated  with a transient increase in renal vascular resistance. Both effects disappeared  later on: creatininemia levels then remained normal. Inulin and p-aminohippurate  (PAH) clearances remained normal throughout follow-up. Neither permanent renal  failure nor progressive deterioration of renal function occurred in either group  or in individual patients. A 10 to 12% increase in inulin and PAH clearance was  elicited by IV amino acid infusion at 7 to 10 years, a finding consistent with a  normal renal functional reserve. Patients with moderate kidney lesions on biopsy  at 1 year had normal and stable clearance values at 7 to 13 years. The prevalence  of arterial hypertension and retinopathy was lower in the CyA-treated group than  in the control group, possibly because of the tighter metabolic control obtained  in the CyA group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that low-dose CyA treatment  combined with thorough monitoring does not result in long-term renal dysfunction.","2002-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","464-472","","6","18","","Diabetes Metab Res Rev","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12469360","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Time Factors; Follow-Up Studies; Pregnancy; Hypertension/chemically induced; Creatinine/blood; Kidney Function Tests; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Kidney/*drug effects/physiopathology; Autoimmune Diseases/*drug therapy; Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/*toxicity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity; Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology; Proteinuria/chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this  end we first examined the impact of CRF on the pharmacokinetics of IGF-I and then  we examined the effect of prolonged IGF-I treatment on the renal function of  patients with an average GFR of 17 mL/min/1.73 m2. Interestingly the metabolic  clearance rate of IGF-I in CRF subjects was similar to that in normal subjects  even though the total serum IGF-I levels rose to higher maximum levels. This  increase was due to a reduced volume of IGF-I distribution, a consequence of the  elevated serum IGF binding proteins in CRF subjects. Treatment with IGF-I (60  mg/kg twice daily sc) for 31 days resulted in a 14% and 18% increase in the  inulin and PAH clearances respectively (n = 6 patients). These parameters  returned to basal levels on stopping treatment. Serum immunoreactive IGFBP-3  levels fell and IGFBP-2 and -3 levels rose during IGF-I therapy. Adverse effects  were mild, of short duration and easily manageable. Thus IGF-I pharmacokinetics  are largely unchanged in CRF and the administration of IGF-I produces a modest  improvement in the GFR. These results appear to justify more extensive  examination of the therapeutic role of IGF-I in the treatment of CRF.","1998-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","349-356","","2","20","","Ren Fail","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9574462","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Blotting, Western; Recombinant Proteins; Kidney/*physiopathology; Blood Urea Nitrogen; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Creatinine/blood/urine; Inulin/metabolism; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/blood; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that the  nitric oxide (NO) system would be upregulated in OC users and that this would be  reflected by a blunted hemodynamic response to l-arginine infusion. All subjects  were studied after a 7-day controlled sodium and protein diet. Inulin and  para-aminohippurate clearance techniques were used to assess renal function.  l-Arginine was infused at 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg, each over 30 min. Skin  endothelial NO synthase mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR. While OC  nonusers exhibited significant increases in effective renal plasma flow (670.8  +/- 35.6 to 816.2 +/- 59.7 ml.min(-1).1.73 m(-2)) and glomerular filtration rate  (133.4 +/- 4.3 to 151.0 +/- 5.7 ml.min(-1).1.73 m(-2), P = 0.04) and declines in  renal vascular resistance (81.1 +/- 6.1 to 63.5 +/- 6.2 mmHg.ml(-1).min, P =  0.001) at the lower l-arginine infusion rates, the responses in OC users were  blunted. While l-arginine reduced mean arterial pressure at the 250 and 500 mg/kg  doses in OC nonusers, OC users only exhibited a decrease in mean arterial  pressure at the highest infusion rate. In contrast, tissue endothelial NO  synthase mRNA levels were higher in the OC users (P = 0.04). In summary, these  findings suggest that the NO system is upregulated by OC use in young, healthy  women. Increased activity of the NO pathway may modulate the hemodynamic effects  of RAS activation in OC users.","2007-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F1539-1544","","5","293","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17715260","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Infusions, Intravenous; Blood Pressure/drug effects; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Nitric Oxide/*metabolism; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects/physiology; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Arginine/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Kidney/*drug effects/*physiology; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacology; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/genetics; Skin/enzymology; Up-Regulation/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-four subjects were studied (13 normotensive and 11 hypertensive) in a  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study using fenoldopam, a selective  D1-like receptor agonist. Subjects were studied in sodium metabolic balance at  300 mEq/d, after which the salt sensitivity of their blood pressure was  determined. Fenoldopam at peak doses of 0.1 to 0.2 microgram/kg per minute  decreased mean arterial pressure in hypertensive subjects but did not change mean  pressure in normotensive subjects. Fenoldopam increased renal plasma flow to a  greater extent in hypertensive than normotensive subjects. Fenoldopam increased  both urinary and fractional sodium excretions in the hypertensive and  normotensive groups. In normotensive but not hypertensive subjects, fenoldopam  increased the fractional excretion of lithium and distal sodium delivery. In  contrast, both distal fractional sodium reabsorption and sodium-potassium  exchange fell significantly in hypertensive subjects. We conclude that human  essential hypertension is associated with a reduction in the proximal tubular  response to D1-like receptor stimulation compared with normotensive subjects.  Hypertensive subjects appear to have a compensatory upregulation of renal  vascular and distal tubular D1-like receptor function that offsets the proximal  tubular defect, resulting in an enhanced natriuretic response to D1-like receptor  stimulation.","1997-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","115-122","","1 Pt 1","29","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9039090","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Cross-Over Studies; Infusions, Intravenous; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Natriuresis/drug effects; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules/*drug effects/physiology; Sodium/urine; Renal Plasma Flow/drug effects; Lithium/urine; Dopamine Agonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Fenoldopam/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Hypertension/etiology/*metabolism/physiopathology; Receptors, Dopamine D1/*drug effects/metabolism; Sodium, Dietary/administration & dosage/adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renal function deteriorates with age, yet dosage guidelines for antibiotics that  allow for this reduction remain to be established. Ceftazidime, a cephalosporin  with enhanced antipseudomonal activity that is eliminated primarily by glomerular  filtration, has been evaluated in the elderly. Herein, we review ceftazidime's  pharmacokinetic profile and dosing considerations in this population. Several  aspects of renal function deteriorate with the normal aging process, including a  decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Using serum creatinine concentrations  as an estimate of the GFR in the elderly is unreliable; a more reliable way of  estimating GFR is the use of inulin or 51Cr-editic acid clearance or calculation  from formulas or nomograms based on age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine. From  pharmacokinetic studies it was found that the elderly individual without renal  disease generally has an increased elimination half-life and decreased clearance  of ceftazidime compared with a young person. A positive correlation (r =  0.7-0.95) was shown between ceftazidime clearance and GFR, suggesting that  estimates of GFR may be used to determine the ceftazidime dose. In several  studies, the trough (after 12 hours) ceftazidime serum concentration exceeded by  several fold its minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit 90% of  organisms for most commonly encountered organisms; efficacy and safety were also  confirmed with an every-12-hour regimen. A twice-daily dosage regimen for  ceftazidime in elderly patients with normal renal function should be considered  based on age-related decreases in renal function and drug elimination.","1991-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","284-288","","3","25","","DICP","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2028636","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Half-Life; Age Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Drug Administration Schedule; Aged, 80 and over; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Ceftazidime/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cell physiology","","0363-6143","10.1152/ajpcell.2000.279.6.C1772","","In patients with amyloid beta-related cerebrovascular disorders, e.g. , Alzheimer's disease, one finds increased deposition of amyloid peptide (Abeta)  and increased presence of monocyte/microglia cells in the brain. However,  relatively little is known of the role of Abeta in the trafficking of monocytes  across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Our studies show that interaction of  Abeta(1-40) with monolayer of human brain endothelial cells results in augmented  adhesion and transendothelial migration of monocytic cells (THP-1 and HL-60) and  peripheral blood monocytes. The Abeta-mediated migration of monocytes was  inhibited by antibody to Abeta receptor (RAGE) and platelet endothelial cell  adhesion molecule (PECAM-1). Additionally, Abeta-induced transendothelial  migration of monocytes were inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitor and augmented  by phosphatase inhibitor. We conclude that interaction of Abeta with RAGE  expressed on brain endothelial cells initiates cellular signaling leading to the  transendothelial migration of monocytes. We suggest that increased diapedesis of  monocytes across the BBB in response to Abeta present either in the peripheral  circulation or in the brain parenchyma may play a role in the pathophysiology of  Abeta-related vascular disorder.","2000-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","C1772-1781","","6","279","","Am J Physiol Cell Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11078691","","","","Adult; Humans; Carbon Radioisotopes; Cells, Cultured; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology; Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products; Cell Survival/drug effects; Indoles/pharmacology; Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology; Dextrans/pharmacokinetics; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Anticoagulants/pharmacokinetics; Cell Movement/drug effects/immunology; Antibodies/pharmacology; Capillaries/cytology/metabolism; Amyloid beta-Peptides/*pharmacology; Blood-Brain Barrier/immunology; Brain/blood supply/metabolism; Cell Adhesion/drug effects/immunology; Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism; Genistein/pharmacology; HL-60 Cells/cytology; Maleimides/pharmacology; Monocytes/*cytology; Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*immunology; Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the mechanisms that generate albumin gradients across airway  epithelia, we have investigated whether active albumin absorption is a feature of  bronchial epithelia. Freshly excised canine bronchi were mounted in Ussing  chambers and short-circuited. Permeability coefficients of 14C-labeled canine  albumin (Palb) were measured in the mucosal-to-submucosal (M----S) and  submucosal-to-mucosal (S----M) directions in conductance-matched tissues. Mean  steady-state values for Palb in the absorptive (M----S) direction (5.97 +/- 1.89  x 10(-7) cm/s) were significantly greater than rates in the S----M direction  (1.09 +/- 0.41 x 10(-7) cm/s). Simultaneous measurements detected no asymmetry of  transport of the fluid phase marker [3H]inulin. Gel filtration chromatography  demonstrated that the majority of the radiolabel released into the submucosal  bathing solution represented albumin fragments. Albumin fragments per se were not  transported because no asymmetries in permeabilities of albumin fragments  isolated from spontaneous degradation of tracer were detected. Decreasing the  temperature of the bathing solution from 37 to 4 degrees C completely inhibited  net albumin absorption. [14C]albumin transport was saturated by addition of high  concentrations of unlabeled albumin (estimated Michaelis constant = 1.6 x 10(-3)  M). These results demonstrate that albumin is absorbed by a low-affinity process  that may contribute to the maintenance of low albumin concentrations in  secretions.","1989-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","2772-2777","","6","66","","J Appl Physiol (1985)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2745340","","","","Male; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Dogs; Absorption; Epithelium/metabolism; Bronchi/*metabolism; Serum Albumin/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prodrug approach is commonly utilized to enhance solubility  of hydrophobic drugs. However, for accelerated drug absorption, supersaturated  solutions need to be employed. In this work, a novel prodrug/enzyme based system  was developed wherein prodrug and enzyme are coadministered at the point of  absorption (e.g., nasal cavity) to form in situ supersaturated drug solutions for  enhanced bioavailability. A combination of fosphenytoin/alkaline phosphatase was  used as a model system. Prodrug conversion kinetics were evaluated with various  prodrug/enzyme ratios at pH 7.4 and 32 °C. Phenytoin permeation rates were  determined at various degrees of supersaturation (S = 0.8-6.1), across confluent  Madin Darby canine kidney II-wild type monolayers (a nasal epithelium model),  with prodrug and enzyme spiked into the apical chamber. Membrane intactness was  confirmed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and inulin  permeability. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin concentrations were analyzed using HPLC.  Results indicated that a supersaturated solution could be formed using such  prodrug/enzyme systems. Drug absorption increased proportionately with increasing  degrees of supersaturation; this flux was 1.5-6 fold greater than that for the  saturated phenytoin solution. The experimental data fitted reasonably well to a  two compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) model with first order conversion of prodrug  to drug. This prodrug/enzyme system markedly enhances drug transport across the  model membrane. Applied in vivo, this strategy could be used to facilitate drug  absorption through mucosal membranes when absorption is limited by solubility.","2013-09-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","3519-3524","","9","10","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23937162","","","","Animals; Cell Line; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Dogs; Solubility; Absorption; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Prodrugs/*chemistry; Enzymes/*chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Classical interstitial substances (labeled albumin,  inulin, sucrose, and sodium) and labeled water were found to undergo flow limited  distribution in the liver. An excluded volume phenomenon created systematic  variation in accessible interstitial space (that is, Disse space) values, smaller  for larger molecular weight substances. Labeled rubidium entered liver cells in a  concentrative fashion (return from cells was very small, early in time). Labeled  glucose liver cell entry was found to exhibit the characteristics of a  carrier-mediated membrane transport process. Labeled galactose showed saturation  of intracellular sequestration, as well as of the cell entry process, the former  at much lower galactose concentrations. Straight-chain labeled monohydric  alcohols were found to enter liver cells in a flow-limited fashion. Labeled  ethanol consumption, when related to underlying steady ethanol values, exhibited  Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A substantial extra intracellular enzymic space of  distribution was found for the C3- and C4- straight-chain alcohols, predicted by  the kinetics. Development of the tracer approach allowed the differentiation and  characterization of the processes by which substances penetrate the cell membrane  barrier and those resulting in intracellular sequestration.","1995-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","484-501","","6","18","","Clin Invest Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 8714792","","","","Humans; Animals; Biological Transport; Liver/*metabolism; *Pharmacokinetics; Research Support as Topic; Cell Membrane/*metabolism; Career Mobility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to assess the short term effects  of a single 5-L paracentesis without albumin replacement on total central blood  volume, systemic and renal hemodynamics, sodium homeostasis, and neurohumoral  factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis and  tense, diuretic-resistant ascites were studied before and 48 h after a single 5-L  paracentesis without albumin infusion. Systemic hemodynamics and total central  blood volume were assessed using radionuclide angiography. Glomerular filtration  rate and effective renal plasma flow were measured by inulin and  para-aminohippurate clearances, respectively. Lithium clearance was used as an  index of proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium. In addition, plasma  concentrations of neurohumoral factors were determined. RESULTS: Total central  blood volume was 2.41 +/- 0.33 L/m2 (mean +/- SEM) before and 2.34 +/- 0.18 L/m2  48 h after large volume paracentesis (p = 0.76). Similarly, no differences were  detected in the cardiac index, glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma  flow, urinary sodium excretion, hematocrit, plasma renin activity, or  concentrations of plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, or atrial natriuretic  factor. CONCLUSIONS: A single large volume paracentesis without albumin  replacement causes no disturbances in systemic and renal hemodynamics 48 h after  the procedure. These results suggest that a single 5-L paracentesis without  albumin infusion is a safe and satisfactory short term option for the management  of patients with cirrhosis and tense, diuretic-resistant ascites.","1997-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","394-399","","3","92","","Am J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9068457","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Homeostasis; Drug Resistance; Hematocrit; Heart/*physiopathology; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney/*physiopathology; Cardiac Output; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/metabolism; Blood Volume; Aldosterone/blood; Norepinephrine/blood; Renin/blood; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Liver Cirrhosis/*physiopathology; Renal Plasma Flow, Effective; *Paracentesis; Albumins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Ascites/drug therapy/physiopathology/*therapy; Diuretics/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Neurotransmitter Agents/blood/*physiology; Plasma Substitutes/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Sodium/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A moderate  reversible increase in creatinine plasma levels has been reported with  fenofibrate therapy; however, it is not known whether this increased  creatininemia reflects a fenofibrate induced alteration of renal function or if  fenofibrate interferes with creatinine tubular handling. We prospectively  examined the effect of 2 weeks fenofibrate treatment (200 mg daily) on renal  function in thirteen hyperlipidemic patients with normal renal function or mild  to moderate renal failure (Creat Cl: 110 to 30 ml/min). This study confirms that  fenofibrate therapy significantly increases creatininemia in patients with mild  to moderate renal failure (147 +/- 12 versus 170 +/- 15 mmol/l; p = 0.014), but  does not alter renal hemodynamic nor glomerular filtration rate as assessed by  the stability of PAH (304 +/- 56 versus 311 +/- 49 ml/min; p = NS) and inulin  clearances (51.7 +/- 6 versus 52.3 +/- 7 ml/min; p = NS). The increase in  creatininemia is neither due to an inhibition of creatinine tubular excretion,  since no change in creatinine clearance was observed (69 +/- 8 versus 68 +/- 8  ml/min; p = NS), but appears to be associated to a parallel increase in  creatinine daily urinary excretion (13.7 +/- 5 versus 15.4 +/- 4 mmol; p = 0.03).  In conclusion, fenofibrate therapy in renal patients does not worsen renal  function, nor diminish the reliability of creatinine clearance for its follow-up  in spite of a significant rise in creatininemia.

The accuracy of these estimates naturally influences their ability to  predict certain pharmacokinetic parameters and appropriate drug dosages.  Creatinine clearance is the most widely used estimate of renal function. Many  formulas have been developed to provide a quick, relatively accurate prediction  of creatinine clearance and, supposedly, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  However, an understanding of the limitations associated with creatinine clearance  estimations raises questions concerning their reliability as an aid in  individualizing drug therapy. Many factors such as disease states, age, diet,  analytical variations, and drug interactions affect the relationship between  estimates and measures of creatinine clearance and GFR. As a result, creatinine  clearance estimates using these formulas are often poor reflections of measured  creatinine clearance or GFR. Also, studies comparing measured creatinine  clearance with more accurate methods of assessing renal function (i.e., inulin)  reveal errors that are often exaggerated as renal function declines. Therefore,  estimated creatinine clearance is twice removed from the associated  pharmacokinetic parameter. Despite these limitations, no other clinically  relevant and convenient assessment of renal function is available. The authors  recommend that the appropriate caveats be considered when using these tools  clinically. For drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, estimates of creatinine  clearance should only be used to establish initial dosing regimens, with  subsequent therapy based on parameters generated from concentration  determinations.","1990-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1185-1190","","12","24","","DICP","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2089830","","","","Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Drug Interactions; Age Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Diet; Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Drug Therapy; Creatinine/blood/*metabolism; Kidney/metabolism/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies were carried out during maximal water diuresis. During the  sodium-rich diet, indomethacin raised minimal urine osmolality from 61 +/- 1 to  72 +/- 2 mosm/kg (P less than 0.05), and during the sodium-restricted diet from  55 +/- 3 to 93 +/- 6 mosm/kg (P less than 0.01). Indomethacin reduced maximal  free water clearance only during the low-sodium diet, and had no consistent  effect on inulin clearance and the fractional excretions of sodium, phosphate and  uric acid. Nevertheless, FRLi rose substantially, from 71 +/- 2% to 75 +/- 2% (P  less than 0.01) and from 75 +/- 2% to 81 +/- 2% (P less than 0.01) during high-  and low-sodium diets respectively. During either diet, indomethacin caused a  significant reduction of 24-h urine PGE2 excretion. Since indomethacin is not  supposed to influence proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, the rise in lithium  reabsorption occurred beyond this nephron level, presumably in the loop of Henle.  Clearly, the FRLi cannot be used as a quantitative marker of proximal tubular  sodium reabsorption in humans in all conditions.","1989","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","27-31","","1","4","","Nephrol Dial Transplant","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2494594","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Absorption; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Indomethacin/*pharmacology; Dinoprostone/urine; Kidney Tubules/*drug effects; Lithium/*pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules, Distal/*drug effects/metabolism; Lithium Carbonate; Sodium, Dietary/administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies showed that  acetaldehyde disrupts intestinal epithelial barrier function and increases  paracellular permeability by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. In the  present study, the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in protection of  epithelial barrier function from acetaldehyde was evaluated in Caco-2 intestinal  epithelial cell monolayer. METHODS: Caco-2 cells on Transwell inserts were  exposed to acetaldehyde in the absence or presence of EGF, and the paracellular  permeability was evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and  unidirectional flux of inulin. Integrity of epithelial tight junctions and  adherens junctions was analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and  immunoblot analysis of occludin, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, E-cadherin, and  beta-catenin in the actin cytoskeleton. Reorganization of actin cytoskeletal  architecture was examined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Acetaldehyde increased  paracellular permeability to inulin and lipopolysaccharide, and EGF significantly  reduced these effects of acetaldehyde in a time- and dose-dependent manner. EGF  prevented acetaldehyde-induced reorganization of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and  beta-catenin from the cellular junctions to the intracellular compartments.  Acetaldehyde treatment induced a reorganization of actin cytoskeletal network and  reduced the levels of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin associated  with the actin cytoskeleton. EGF effectively prevented acetaldehyde-induced  reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and the interaction of occludin, ZO-1,  E-cadherin, and beta-catenin with the actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSION: These  results indicate that EGF attenuates acetaldehyde-induced disruption of tight  junctions and adherens junctions and prevents acetaldehyde-induced reorganization  of actin cytoskeleton and its interaction with occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and  beta-catenin.","2004-05","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","797-804","","5","28","","Alcohol Clin Exp Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15166657","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Caco-2 Cells; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects/*physiology; Acetaldehyde/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology; Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects/*physiology; Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major obstacles to delivering  drugs to the colon are the absorption and degradation pathways in the upper  gastrointestinal tract. However, a successfully designed colon-targeted system  can overcome these obstacles. Targeting drugs to the colon has proven quite  valuable in a variety of disorders, and the colon has proven to be a potential  site for local as well as systemic administration of drugs. Colon targeting has  proven beneficial for local action in a variety of disease conditions, such as  inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colonic cancer.  Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, cationized  antioxidant enzymes, genetically engineered bacteria to produce cytokines,  nicotine, and other drugs have exhibited significantly enhanced efficacy when  delivered to the colon. Targeting drugs to cancer cells through receptors and  ligands have opened up new avenues in the treatment of colonic cancer. Colon  targeting has also proven useful for systemic action of protein-peptide drugs  such as insulin, calcitonin, and met-enkaphalin and even for other nonpeptide  drugs such as cardiovascular and antiasthmatic agents. This review also presents  various approaches for targeting orally administered dosage forms to the colon.  The use of a prodrug approach, bioadhesive polymers, and coating with  pH-sensitive and biodegradable polymers has been, to an extent, highly successful  in delivering the targeted formulations to the site of action. Biodegrable  hydrogels such as amylose, chondroitin sulphate, chitosan, inulin, guar gum, and  pectin have also been successfully used to achieve oral colon-targeted delivery.","2007","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","147-202","","2","24","","Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17725524","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Intestinal Absorption; Biotransformation; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; *Drug Delivery Systems; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*administration & dosage; Drug Carriers/chemistry; Colon/drug effects/metabolism; Colonic Diseases/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plasma clearance of  nonradioactive iohexol has been proposed as a reliable alternative to renal  clearance of inulin for estimation of GFR. However, the precision of this method  in estimating GFR in patients with renal disease has not been determined so far.  This issue was assessed by determining plasma clearance of iohexol on three  different occasions during a 12-d period in 24 patients with renal disease and a  wide range of renal function (creatinine clearance: 14 to 104 ml/min per 1.73  m2). Overall, the mean intraindividual coefficient of variation was 5.59%, and  the reproducibility was 6.28%. The precision of the method also applied to the  subgroup of patients with moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency, because a low  coefficient of variation (5.71%) and a high reproducibility (6.57%) were found in  patients with GFR < or =40 ml/min per 1.73 m2. It was also shown that the  precision of GFR measurement by the plasma clearance of iohexol is not affected  by the gender. These findings indicate that the method of plasma clearance of  iohexol allows a good precision in the estimation of GFR in patients with normal  renal function and different degrees of renal dysfunction.","1998-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","310-313","","2","9","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9527409","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Reproducibility of Results; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Chronic Disease; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney Diseases/*diagnosis/physiopathology; *Iohexol/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renal vein and urine outflow  curves were obtained after an intraarterial pulse injection of 125I-labeled  albumin (plasma reference), creatinine (extracellular reference), [14C]inulin,  and chromatographically homogeneous 3H-labeled neutral dextrans. The urine  recovery data reflect solute losses across the glomerulus. The renal vein outflow  curves contain information about both glomerular and postglomerular extraction.  For dextrans less than 13,500 daltons the urine transit pattern was superimposed  on the glomerular markers creatinine and inulin. Relative to 125I-labeled  albumin, the renal vein recoveries for creatinine, inulin, and dextrans (less  than 13,500 daltons) were all equal. The renal vein mean transit time (tdextran)  was greater than talbumin and less than tcreatinine. With increasing dextran  size, tdextran progressively decreased. Eventually for dextrans greater than  15,500 daltons, tdextran became equal to talbumin in the renal vein, whereas  urine recovery relative to inulin decreased with increasing size. Urine recovery  of 3H-labeled dextran (ED) relative to inulin (Ei) provided a measure of  unidirectional fractional glomerular extraction (ED/Ei). Constant infusion  fractional clearance measurement of the same dextrans [U/P)D/(U/P)i) was found to  equal ED/Ei obtained from the MIDT. Within the autoregulatory range of glomerular  filtration, ED/Ei was invariant with reduction in renal plasma flow. Therefore,  under the experimental conditions employed in the present study, diffusion across  the glomerulus was negligible relative to convection. This permitted estimation  of the reflection coefficients for the series of neutral dextrans. Postglomerular  extraction was markedly flow dependent, which implies a major diffusion  limitation. Application of a barrier-limited distributed model permitted  quantitation of postglomerular capillary permeability coefficients for neutral  markers of less than 5000 daltons.","1984-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","171-179","","2","43","","Fed Proc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6692936","","","","Metabolic Clearance Rate; Structure-Activity Relationship; Molecular Weight; Kidney/*blood supply; *Capillary Permeability; Kidney Glomerulus/blood supply/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four grams of placebo,  oligofructose or the mixture inulin+oligofructose was added to each glass of  orange juice immediately before it was consumed.

Conversely, in patients with fluid retention (oedema,  pleural effusions, ascites), there is a substantial discrepancy between the total  plasma clearance and the urinary plasma clearance. This is owing to delayed  indicator distribution to smaller or larger parts of the interstitial space,  which in patients with ascites may simulate a peritoneal dialysator. In patients  with fluid retention, urinary plasma clearance should be assessed to obtain a  correct measurement of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In theory, total  plasma clearance with late samples (24-h, 48-h) may be applied in patients with  fluid retention, but validation hereof has not been performed.

Twenty-four-hour creatinine clearance overestimates GFR in patients with poor  renal function. Inulin and iothalamate clearances are accepted reference  standards for determining GFR but are expensive and laborious. We have previously  reported that GFRs obtained by measuring the disappearance of 99mTc-DTPA from  ultrafiltered (protein-free) samples of plasma were virtually identical to those  obtained by the iothalamate method. However, the subjects used in that study had  normal to only moderately decreased renal function. METHODS: The accuracy of  measuring GFR by plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA was determined in subjects where  renal function varied from normal to severely impaired. In all subjects, GFR was  established by clearance of 125I-iothalamate from urine and serum and was used as  the standard of reference. RESULTS: For subjects with normal to moderately  diminished renal function (GFR > 20 ml/min), the correlation between values of  GFR obtained by the DTPA and iothalamate methods was high (n = 18, r = 0.966).  The difference between the pairs of GFR values obtained by the two methods was  not statistically significant (p > 0.1). In patients with severe renal  insufficiency (GFR < 20 ml/min), the correlation between the DTPA and iothalamate  methods was poor (n = 11, r = 0.236), and the GFR values obtained by the two  methods were statistically different (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results  suggest that GFR can be determined accurately by plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA  in all patients except those with severe renal insufficiency.","1997-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","110-114","","2","25","","J Nucl Med Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9239614","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Sensitivity and Specificity; Creatinine/urine; Contrast Media; Radionuclide Imaging; Ultrafiltration; Inulin; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Iothalamic Acid/pharmacokinetics; *Radiopharmaceuticals/blood/urine; *Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate/blood; Iodine Radioisotopes/blood/urine; Kidney Failure, Chronic/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; Renal Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eight ewes were used: four on a regular diet (total nitrogen 188.7  g.kg-1 dry matter) and the other four on a low protein diet (total nitrogen 109.4  g.kg-1 dry matter). On each animal, perfusions were performed on one kidney; the  other one was kept as a control. Fractional excretion of urea (TEu) and urea  (Cu), inulin, para-aminohippurate and osmolar clearances, were determined during  five experimental periods of 30 min each (T = control, 1M = perfusion with 1M  urea solution, R1 = first period of recovery, 3M = perfusion with 3M urea  solution, R2 = second period of recovery). 1. During control periods sheep on low  protein diet have a greater capacity of urea retention than sheep on regular  diet, under antidiuretic conditions (inulin U/P = 200). The following data (means  +/- S.D.) are all reduced in animals on low protein diet: TEu by 36% (0.38 +/-  0.19 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.28 for normal protein sheep, p less than 0.05), Cu by 55%  (0.50 +/- 0.19 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.49 ml.min-1.kg-1 for normal sheep, p less than  0.01) and amount of urea excreted by 80% (2.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.4 +/- 2.7 mg.min-1  for normal sheep, p less than 0.01). 2. The linear regression analysis of the  relationship between tubular reabsorption of urea and its filtered amount shows  that the capacity of urea retention is significantly higher in low protein sheep  and that the difference between the two groups is greater as the filtered amount  increases. Following 1M and 3M perfusions, the capacity of urea reabsorption by  the perfused kidneys is significantly decreased in low protein animals whereas  there is no change in the normal ones. The result is that perfused kidneys of the  low protein sheep increase the amount of urea excreted during these periods:  urine concentration of urea (Uu) increases by 55% during R1 and by 144% during  R2, TEu increases by 60% during R1 and by 147% during R2 and Cu increases by 40%  during R1 and by 95% during R2, without any variation of urine flow rate. These  changes could be understood, provided that an important transfer of the perfused  urea to the renal medulla in the low protein sheep would reduce the concentration  gradients which enhance urea passive reabsorption from the collecting  ducts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1988","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","64-73","","2","83","","J Physiol (Paris)","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 3251040","","","","Animals; Perfusion; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Dietary Proteins/*administration & dosage; Sheep/*metabolism; Kidney Pelvis/*metabolism; Urea/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This interval, defined as the transepithelial passage  time, was relatively short (about 15 s) for glucose, in agreement with earlier  results in the dog. In contrast, several amino acids required an average  transepithelial passage time of about 40 s. Values for aspartate could only be  obtained when its large basolateral uptake was inhibited by excess succinate. The  long transepithelial passage time may be due to the slow extrusion of reabsorbed  amino acids across basolateral cell membranes. This hypothesis was supported by  the extent of tissue accumulation of amino acids during reabsorption. Even though  basolateral transfer may thus limit the linear rate of movement of filtered amino  acids across the epithelium, the step determining fractional absorption from the  lumen is situated at the brush border.","1985-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F878-883","","6 Pt 2","249","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 4073270","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Time Factors; Tissue Distribution; Absorption; Glucose/metabolism; Mathematics; Kidney Cortex/metabolism; Kidney Tubules/*metabolism; Amino Acids/*metabolism; Aspartic Acid/metabolism; Cycloleucine/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With V1 = 17.5 l, Vss  is independent of renal function and the regularly observed decrease of V beta  with Cltot is explained by the simplification inherent in the one-compartment  model used for calculating V beta. A good correlation between kinetic rate  constants and biologic data for the exchange of a drug between central and  peripheral compartments can be expected only if the volume of the central  compartment is close to that of the inulin space.

A stenosing silver  clip was place on the left renal artery of four mongrel dogs. Six months later,  each dog received an infusion of gentamicin and inulin. Blood and urine samples  were collected serially. In each dog, the ischemic left kidney was smaller and  had a lower RPF and CCR. The decrease in CCR was highly correlated with the  decrease in RPF. Measured gentamicin kidney concentrations were found to be in  good agreement with predicted values based on the amount reabsorbed and the  kidney weight. Within each animal (control vs. ischemic kidney), there was a  significant correlation between the filtered load of gentamicin and both the  renal reabsorption and excretion of gentamicin. These relationships exhibited  high R2 values, demonstrating that the induced ischemia did not alter the  filtration or reabsorbtive mechanisms of gentamicin within the animal, but only  decreased the filtered load. Between animals, gentamicin excretion was  proportional to filtered load, but gentamicin reabsorption had the lowest r2  value, explaining only 49% of the observed variance. The unexplained variance  encountered in gentamicin reabsorption between animals establishes that there are  important determinants of renal tissue concentration that are independent of  filtration or filtered load. This study suggests that a reduction in glomerular  filtration is not an important risk factor for elevated gentamicin renal tissue  concentrations, provided that serum concentrations are controlled within the  therapeutic range.","1982-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","201-210","","2","100","","J Lab Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7097107","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs; Absorption; Kidney Diseases/*metabolism; Ischemia/metabolism; Constriction; Gentamicins/*metabolism; Renal Artery; Kidney/blood supply/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In all protein groups, we observed significant increases in Jv and in cell height  from SFPST segments obtained from remnant renal tissue harvested 3 wk  post-uninephrectomy when compared with sham-operated controls. Uninephrectomy  also led to compensatory hypertrophy of whole-kidney mass and to elevations in  inulin clearances. Increased protein intake consistently enhanced these renal and  SFPST structural and functional changes, whereas protein restriction limited  compensatory responses. The changes in Jv following uninephrectomy were  attributable to increases in the active, but not the passive, component of Jv in  all protein groups. Moreover, the active component of Jv could be modified by  altering dietary protein intake. Single kidney inulin clearances were correlated  with the changes in total Jv with ultrafiltrate perfusate (r = 0.88; P less than  0.025), with artificial perfusate (r = 0.95; P less than 0.01), the active  component of Jv (r = 0.96; P less than 0.005), SFPST cell height (r = 0.94; P  less than 0.01), and whole-kidney weight (r = 0.99; P less than 0.005). These  results indicate that hypertrophy of renal structure and augmentation of function  following uninephrectomy and increased dietary protein are also observed in  single rabbit SFPST segments perfused in vitro; that the hypertrophic responses  following uninephrectomy can be enhanced or reduced by increases or decreases in  protein intake, respectively; and that these changes are paralleled by changes in  glomerular filtration rate.","1987-08","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F222-233","","2 Pt 2","253","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3618787","","","","Female; Animals; Rabbits; Absorption; Body Fluids/*metabolism; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism; *Nephrectomy; Dietary Proteins/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The amount of otilonium bromide transported was determined by  high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Epithelial barrier  integrity was estimated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and  the transport of reference compounds, P-glycoprotein activity by measuring  rhodamine 123 efflux. Results showed that the apparent permeability of otilonium  bromide was comparable to that of our zero permeability marker, inulin, in the  apical-to-basal direction and similar to that of rhodamine 123 in the  basal-to-apical direction. The P-glycoprotein substrate, verapamil, prevented  otilonium bromide efflux and, conversely, otilonium bromide inhibited  P-glycoprotein activity. Bile salts induced a transient opening of tight  junctions, as measured by selective increase of paracellular transport, and  significantly enhanced the absorption of otilonium bromide. In turn otilonium  bromide potentiates the effect of bile salts on tight junctions without modifying  their critical micellar concentration or altering cell viability. In conclusion,  otilonium bromide is a paracellularly transported drug whose absorption, in  amounts sufficient to exert a spasmolytic effect, is favoured by bile salts.  P-glycoprotein, by stimulating efflux, contributes to remove excess compound,  restraining its distribution and site of action to the intestinal wall.","2008-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","4087-4100","","9","97","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18200532","","","","Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Caco-2 Cells; *Intestinal Absorption; Micelles; Bile Acids and Salts/*metabolism; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our consumer research, we have focused on  how the new consumer thinks and talks about gut health. We found out that he is  aware of the existence and the importance of gut microflora. He believes that  foods can influence his own flora. At the same time, our research has tested the  efficiency of several ways to communicate about these aspects. The consumer  reacts quite differently on different marketing concepts. He accepts that natural  ingredients can help his gut flora and expects to find such active ingredients in  common everyday foods and also in diet supplements. Based on this research, we  have condensed the 'prebiotic' message about inulin and oligofructose into a  number of simple communications. The best of these were selected for further  consumer product testing.

Gut bacteria produce desirable as well as undesirable metabolites from fermentation and  sometimes they may act as pathogens. Composition as well as activities of the gut  bacteria can be influenced by nutrition. Prebiotics are food ingredients that  selectively stimulate the growth of colonic bacteria regarded as beneficial, i.  e. bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Fructose polymers (fructo-oligosaccharides,  inulin), galacto-oligosaccharides and soya oligosaccharides were shown to exert  prebiotic activities. In adults, the growth of bifidobacteria was stimulated  especially by inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides. Infant formulas containing  galacto-oligosaccharides and inulin promoted the growth of bifidobacteria in  faeces of bottle-fed infants and resulted in stool characteristics similar to  those found in breast-fed infants. However, at present there is only limited  knowledge on the long-term health consequences of increased counts of  bifidobacteria. In adults, prebiotics can enhance the absorption of calcium from  the colon. They can increase stool frequency and are mildly laxative. Prebiotic  consumption is usually accompanied by mild flatulence and in sensitive persons by  more severe gastrointestinal symptoms. In contrast to the results of animal  experiments, a significant lipid-lowering action of fructo-oligosaccharides has  not been found in humans. In animals, fructo-oligosaccharides have shown a  favourable effect on experimental carcinogenesis.

For  materials penetrating less well, outflow curves consist of throughput material,  which emerges without entering cells, and exchanging material, which has entered.  Two extreme examples are reviewed: labeled rubidium, which enters the cells  concentratively, so that its early outflow profile consists almost exclusively of  throughput material; and D-glucose, which enters nonconcentratively, so that its  throughput and exchanging components overlap in intimate fashion.","1982-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","3033-3039","","14","41","","Fed Proc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6754456","","","","Humans; Models, Biological; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Biological Transport; Glucose/metabolism; Indicator Dilution Techniques; Liver/blood supply/*metabolism; Capillary Permeability; Water/metabolism; Extracellular Space/physiology; Sucrose/metabolism; Rubidium/metabolism; Erythrocytes/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Growing attention has been focused on levan, a β-(2,6)  fructan that possesses more favorable physicochemical properties, such as lower  intrinsic viscosity and greater colloidal stability, than β-(2,1) inulin. Levan  can be used not only as a functional carbohydrate but also as feedstock for the  production of levan-type fructooligosaccharides (L-FOSs). Three types of  levan-degrading enzymes (LDEs), including levanase (EC 3.2.1.65), β-(2,6)-fructan  6-levanbiohydrolase (LF2ase, EC 3.2.1.64), and levan fructotransferase (LFTase,  EC 4.2.2.16), play significant roles in the biological production of L-FOSs.  These three enzymes convert levan into different L-FOSs, levanbiose, and  difructose anhydride IV (DFA IV), respectively. The prebiotic properties of both  L-FOSs and DFA IV have been confirmed in recent years. Although levanase, LF2ase,  and LFTase belong to the same O-glycoside hydrolase 32 family (GH32), their  catalytic properties and product spectra differ significantly. In this paper,  recent studies on these LDEs are reviewed, including those investigating  microbial source and catalytic properties.

As compared to inulin-type  commercial FOSs, the fermentation of oligolevans/FOSs from Maple syrup led to a  higher count of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis and resulted  in a higher production of lactic acid. This study lays the foundation for the  biotransformation of Maple syrups into functional prebiotic ingredients.","2022-07-15","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","132355","","","382","","Food Chem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Free platinum clearances exceeded the glomerular filtration rate  in all time periods. For example, at 1 to 2 hr, the mean clearance of free  platinum was 224 +/- 32 (S.E.) ml/min compared to a mean creatinine clearance of  94 +/- 15 ml/min or a mean inulin clearance of 94 +/- 17 ml/min (p less than  0.01), indicating secretion of CP or a metabolite. Seven additional cancer  patients were treated with probenecid prior to CP. Fractional platinum  clearances, calculated as a ratio of free platinum clearance to creatinine  clearance, were reduced significantly in the probenecid-treated group (158 +/-  17%) compared to controls (270 +/- 57%) (p less than 0.03). Fractional platinum  clearances, calculated as a ratio of free platinum clearance to inulin clearance,  were also significantly reduced in the treated group (154 +/- 14%) compared to  controls (271 +/- 47%) (p = 0.04).

Different formulas like  creatinine clearance (CrCl) in 24 h urine samples, Cockroft-Gault formula (CGF),  and modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) are being used to come up with  an estimate. In this study, we compared (99m)Tc-DTPA with the formulas mentioned  above in an attempt to best identify the method that would yield the nearly ideal  GFR estimates in the elderly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 76 patients who were  admitted to our clinic, we measured 24 h urine volume (V), urine creatinine  (Ucr), and serum creatinine (Scr) levels together with CrCl, Scr, serum urea  (Su), and albumin (Alb) levels. By using coefficients identified for age, gender,  and race, we calculated modification of diet in renal disease 1 (MDRD1).  Different from MDRD1, we calculated modification of diet in renal disease 2  (MDRD2) that does not include Su and Alb parameters and formulas like CGF that  include Scr, age, gender, and weight parameters to come up with GFR levels. All  patients underwent (99m)Tc-DTPA procedure. RESULTS: The mean of the GFR values  measured by (99m)Tc-DTPA was 54.3 ± 19.9. The means of GFR values calculated by  CrCl, MDRD1, MDRD2, and CGF were 58.0 ± 30.5, 60.9 ± 22.1, 54.4 ± 20.1, and 57.9  ± 22.4, respectively. GFR as measured by (99m)Tc-DTPA showed statistically  significant correlations with the results of other methods (p < 0.001 for all  methods). The most significant correlation was with MDRD1. CONCLUSION: MDRD1 can  be used for next to ideal and accurate predictions of GFR in the elderly in the  daily practice.","2012","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","435-441","","4","34","","Ren Fail","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22268784","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Follow-Up Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Age Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; *Models, Theoretical; Aging/*physiology; Creatinine/*blood; Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Kidney/*physiology; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate/*pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/blood/diagnosis/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have demonstrated previously that all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) plays  an important role in forming functional TJs through a specific retinoic acid  receptor (RAR)/retinoid X receptor heterodimer in epithelial cells. However, the  physiological relevance of retinoic acids (RAs) in maintaining the epithelial  integrity remains to be examined. Here, we show that several types of RA,  including atRA, promote the barrier function of epithelial TJs. Conversely, RA  depletion in the cells by overexpressing CYP26s, cytochrome P450 enzymes  specifically involved in the metabolic inactivation of RAs, induces an increase  of permeability as measured by two differently sized tracer molecules, inulin and  mannitol. This RA-mediated enhancement of barrier function is potentially  associated with the increased expression of TJ-associated genes such as occludin,  claudin-1, claudin-4, and zonula occludens-1. We also found that RARalpha is a  preferential regulator of the epithelial barrier in vitro. Studies of murine  experimental colitis, which is characterized by increased gut permeability,  reveal that RARalpha stimulation significantly attenuates the loss of the  epithelial barrier during colitis in vivo. Our results suggest that cellular RA  bioavailability determines the epithelial integrity, because it is a critical  regulator for barrier protection during mucosal injuries.","2007-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","250-258","","1","71","","Mol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17035595","","","","Humans; Kidney; Animals; Biological Availability; Cell Line; Dogs; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism; Transfection; Bacterial Translocation; Cell Membrane/physiology; Colitis/metabolism; Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists; Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase; Tretinoin/*pharmacokinetics; Urothelium/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tubular absorption, hydrolysis and accumulation of albumin  were examined in all three segments of the rabbit proximal tubule. S1, S2 and S3  segments were dissected and perfused in vitro with tritiated albumin at a  physiologic concentration of 0.0364 mg/ml, and with [14C]inulin to determine  fluid reabsorption. In addition, the three segments were fixed for  ultrastructural examination after perfusion under conditions similar to those in  the physiologic studies. The fluid reabsorption was similar in S1 and S2 but  lower in S3. Albumin absorption was unexpectedly similar in the three segments. A  lower percentage of absorbed albumin was hydrolyzed in the S3 segment compared  with the earlier segments. The values were 70 +/- 15%, 61 +/- 11%, and 30 +/- 4%  for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The cellular accumulation of protein was  highest in the S3 segment. The ultrastructure of the three segments was similar  to that described in in vivo preserved kidneys, and no abnormalities were  observed in the endocytic-lysosomal compartment. These results reveal axial  heterogeneity in the hydrolysis of absorbed albumin by the rabbit proximal tubule  and suggest that under normal physiologic conditions the S3 segment has a lower  lysosomal proteolytic activity. Although the S3 segment maintains a high capacity  for protein absorption, the earlier proximal segments likely have a greater role  in protein degradation.","1988-05","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","549-558","","5","58","","Lab Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3367637","","","","Female; Animals; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Hydrolysis; Temperature; Absorption; Body Fluids/metabolism; Albumins/*metabolism; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/anatomy & histology/*metabolism/ultrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The poorly aqueous soluble diazepam was used  as a lipophilic model drug. The release of diazepam and sugar carrier was  determined to study the mechanisms governing dissolution behaviour. The effect of  carrier dissolution rate and drug load was tested with four different sugars, in  the order of decreasing dissolution rates: sucrose, trehalose and two  oligo-fructoses; inulinDP11 and inulinDP23 having a number average degree of  polymerization (DP) of 11 and 23, respectively. Diazepam was incorporated in  these sugar glasses in the amorphous state by means of freeze drying using water  and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) as solvents. None of the tablets disintegrated  during dissolution. Dissolution of 80% of the lipophilic drug within 20 min was  found when diazepam and sugar dissolution profiles coincided. The sugar carrier  and diazepam dissolved at the same rate, which was constant in time and fast.  This condition was met for relatively slow dissolving carriers like the inulins  or for low drug loads. For relatively fast dissolving carriers like sucrose or  trehalose with high drug loads, release profiles of diazepam and sugar did not  coincide: diazepam dissolved much more slowly than the sugars. In case of  non-coinciding release profiles, diazepam release was split into three phases.  During the first phase non-steady-state dissolution was observed: diazepam  release accelerated and a drug rich layer consisting of crystalline diazepam was  gradually formed. This first phase determined the further release of diazepam.  During the second phase a steady-state release rate was reached: zero-order  release was observed for both drug and carrier. During this phase, the remaining  (non-crystallised) solid dispersion is dissolved without the further occurrence  of crystallisation. The third phase, starting when all carrier is dissolved,  involved the very slow dissolution of crystallised diazepam, which was present  either as the skeleton of a tablet resulting in a zero-order release profile or  as separate particles dispersed in the dissolution medium resulting in a  first-order release. To understand the anomalous dissolution behaviour, a model  is proposed. It describes the phenomena during dissolution of amorphous solid  dispersion tablets and explains that fast dissolution is observed for low drug  loads or slow dissolving carriers like inulin.","2004-07-07","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","441-452","","3","97","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 15212876","","","","Tablets, Enteric-Coated; Solubility/drug effects; Drug Carriers/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Diazepam/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Disaccharides/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Glass/*chemistry; Monosaccharides/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  intestinal mucosa remained intact during our study by morphologic and inulin  clearance criteria and behaved normally with respect to intrinsic factor and  nonintrinsic factor binders. Since no intrinsic factor was present in the  perfusate, PPJ must directly enhance cobalamin uptake by the ileum, perhaps  promoting cobalamin attachment to receptor sites for subsequent transport by  intrinsic factor. PPJ thus seems to affect cobalamin absorption at several  levels. Previous studies have established its interaction with luminal R binders  and with bile. The findings now indicate that pancreatic juice may have an  additional, more direct role in promoting cobalamin absorption in the ileum.","1985-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","143-150","","1","178","","Proc Soc Exp Biol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3966072","","","","Humans; Male; Kinetics; Animals; Guinea Pigs; *Intestinal Absorption; Ileum/drug effects/*metabolism; Vitamin B 12/*metabolism; Cobalt Radioisotopes; Pancreatic Juice/*physiology; Tissue Extracts/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighty-two black and 63 white French  Canadian patients were studied. None had diabetes, and antihypertensive  medications had been discontinued for >/=1 week. Measurements included 24-hour  blood pressure monitoring, fasting plasma lipids, insulin sensitivity determined  with the Bergman minimal model, echocardiogram, microalbumin excretion, and  inulin and lithium clearances. Compared with the white French Canadians, black  patients had an attenuated nighttime reduction in blood pressure (P<0.02),  increased cardiac dimensions (P<0.001), greater microalbumin excretion (P<0.05),  increased inulin clearance (indicative of glomerular hyperfiltration; P<0.001),  and decreased lithium clearance (indicative of increased sodium reabsorption in  the proximal tubule; P<0.001). Blood pressure levels were not related to insulin  resistance; although in blacks, the nighttime reduction in systolic blood  pressure was inversely related to fasting plasma insulin (r=-0.18, P<0.04). In a  stepwise multivariate analysis (including blood pressure levels and components of  the insulin resistance syndrome as independent variables), race was the strongest  predictor of left ventricular mass (r=0.53, P<0.000), relative wall thickness  (r=0.49, P<0.000), and both inulin (r=0.53, P<0.000) and lithium (r=0.41,  P<0.000) clearances. Nighttime systolic blood pressure was also a significant  determinant of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (r=0.37, P<0.000). In  blacks, microalbumin excretion was related to insulin resistance. These  observations are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a genetic  contribution to cardiac hypertrophy, glomerular hyperfiltration, and sodium  retention in blacks with essential hypertension.","2001-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","761-766","","4","38","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11641283","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Insulin Resistance; Predictive Value of Tests; Fasting; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Diet; Multivariate Analysis; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Body Mass Index; Lipids/blood; Blood Pressure/*physiology; Syndrome; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; *White People; Potassium/urine; Sodium/urine; Hypertension/metabolism/*physiopathology; *Black People; Heart Ventricles/*pathology/physiopathology; Insulin/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their structural  similarities, their potencies differ significantly, and only icariin is currently  included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as a quality marker (Q-marker) for  epimedium flavonoids. Furthermore, icariin has the functions of anti-aging,  anti-inflammation, antioxidation, anti-osteoporosis, and ameliorating fibrosis.  We used bioinformatics to look for the GH43 family β-xylosidase genes BbXyl from  Bifidobacterium breve K-110, which has a length of 1347 bp and codes for 448  amino acids. This will allow us to convert epimedin B and epimedin C into icariin  in a specific way. The expression level of recombinant BbXyl in TB medium  containing 1 % inulin as carbon source, with an inducer concentration of  0.05 mmol/L and a temperature of 28 °C, was 86.4 U/mL. Previous studies found  that the α-l-rhamnosidase BtRha could convert epoetin C to produce icariin, so we  combined BbXyl and BtRha to catalyze the conversion of epimedium total flavonoids  in vitro and in vivo to obtain the product icariin.

Radioisotopically  labeled inulin, H2O, and butyric and lauric acid were used to measure net and/or  unidirectional fluxes from the chamber. The unidirectional absorptive transport  of H2O and butyric acid but not lauric acid by jejunal segments was significantly  correlated with flow through the chamber. Plasma volume expansion increased  villous motility but decreased the absorption of H2O and lauric acid. Absorption  of butyric acid from the ileum was little different than from the jejunum  although the degree of villous motility was less and net water absorption was  greater from the ileum. Absorption of butyric acid into dead tissue indicated  that passive diffusion into the tissue accounted for between 7 and 25%, depending  on flow rate, of the absorption in intact tissue and that nonspecific binding was  low. It was concluded that villous motility did not stir the unstirred water  layers and was not directly associated with altered transport.","1990-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","G238-246","","2 Pt 1","258","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2305890","","","","Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Time Factors; Perfusion; Carbon Radioisotopes; Intestinal Absorption; Dogs; *Gastrointestinal Motility; Butyrates/metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/physiology; Jejunum/physiology; Butyric Acid; Ileum/physiology; Intestine, Small/*physiology; Muscle, Smooth/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renal organ clearance of exogenous PP (3.7 +/- 0.3 ml . kg-1 . min-1)  closely approximated that of inulin (3.6 +/- 0.3 ml . kg-1 . min-1), indicating  that renal PP metabolism occurs entirely by glomerular filtration without  contribution from peritubular uptake mechanisms. Urinary PP, chromatographically  indistinguishable from that in plasma but quantitatively accounting for less than  1% of overall renal PP uptake, indicated virtually complete renal degradation of  the peptide to nonimmunoreactive fragments. Renal PP extraction was shown to be  nonsaturable. Plasma half disappearance time of PP was 10.1 +/- 1.0 min and  apparent distribution space 307 +/- 39 ml/kg. Linkage between the hepatic action  and degradation of insulin and glucagon has been proposed, and in this light  absent hepatic PP extraction is noteworthy.

The  first strain, Y. lipolytica YLZ150, was derived from the French wild-type strain  W29. It had inhibited triacylglycerol mobilization (∆tgl4) and β-oxidation  (∆pox1-6), and it overexpressed GPD1, DGA2, HXK1, the native Leloir pathway, SUC2  from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and INU1 from Kluyveromyces marxianus.

In the first experiment, strain YLZ150 was batch-cultured in media  containing different hexoses; the highest values for lipid concentration and  yield of lipids from the substrate were obtained using fructose (20.3 g dm(-3)  and 0.14 g g(-1) , respectively). In the second experiment, we grew the two  strains in fed-batch cultures to examine lipid biosynthesis from inulin (a  fructose polymer). For Y4779, the lipid concentration was 10.3 g dm(-3) and the  yield of lipids from substrate was 0.07 g g(-1) ; in contrast, for YLZ150, these  values were 24 g dm(-3) and 0.16 g g(-1) , respectively.

Methoxy-3H-inulin added simultaneously  served as a marker for the extracellular space and permeability of paracellular  shunt pathways in the preparation. The uptake of sulphanilic acid from the blood  side exceeded that from the luminal side 4--7 fold. The permeation of the acid  was strongly correlated to the permeation of inulin. At 5 micrometer and 2.5 mM  sulphanilic acid under aerobic conditions, the regression lines for the  permeation from lumen to blood pass almost through the origin, while the  regression lines for the permeation from blood to lumen intersect the ordinate at  a positive Y-value. In anaerobiosis, at 25 mM sulphanilic acid, or with addition  of p-toluene sulphonic acid only one regression line is obtained for the  permeation in both directions. It is concluded that besides a permeation of  sulphanilic acid across inulinpermeable shunt pathways an active transport system  exists, which transfers the acid from the blood to the luminal side. This system  is saturable, depends on aerobic energy and exhibits mutual inhibition by a  structurally related compound. The results are comparable to those previously  obtained with cardiac glycosides and quaternary ammonium compounds, in the same  preparation. Thus, the intestinal mucosa is able to secrete the same classes of  compounds which are secreted by the liver and the kidney.","1978-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","331-338","","5","43","","Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Denmark PMID: 726898","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Insulin; Intestinal Absorption; Guinea Pigs; Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism; Intestine, Small/*metabolism; Aerobiosis; Jejunum/metabolism; Anaerobiosis; Benzenesulfonates/*metabolism; Sulfanilic Acids/blood/*metabolism; Tosyl Compounds/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GFR is most commonly  measured by the plasma clearance of radioisotopes, however, use of iohexol, a  non-ionic radiocontrast medium, is a recently described alternative and has shown  good agreement with inulin clearance. A one-compartment model is used for  calculating GFR in most Australian centres but a two-compartment model is more  accurate. AIMS: To set up a non-radioisotopic method for assessment of GFR using  iohexol, and to compare this with the currently used  99mTc-diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid (DTPA) method. Secondly, to compare  GFR results using an unmodified one-compartment model with a one-compartment  model subjected to the Brochner-Mortensen modification. METHODS: Twenty-one  patients with diabetes had assessment of GFR with simultaneous measurements of  99mTc-DTPA and iohexol plasma clearance. Plasma clearance was determined by the  slope intercept method and then modified according to the Brochner-Mortensen  equation. Plasma iohexol concentrations were determined by capillary  electrophoresis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between iohexol and  99mTc-DTPA derived GFR values, difference 4.3+/-7.7 mL/minute (mean+/-SD). This  was despite 99mTc-DTPA protein binding demonstrated in the range of 5-10%.  Comparison of GFR results using an unmodified one-compartment model with a  Brochner-Mortensen corrected one-compartment model showed higher GFR values with  the former, in the range of 20-30% for GFR values > 100 mL/minute. CONCLUSION:  Iohexol provides an efficient alternative to radioisotopic methods for serial  measurement of GFR in diabetic patients with hyperfiltration, incipient and overt  nephropathy. A one-compartment model with its inherent overestimation of GFR  should be replaced by the Brochner-Mortensen modified one-compartment model.","1999-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","693-700","","5","29","","Aust N Z J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 10630650","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Electrophoresis, Capillary; Diabetes Mellitus/blood/*physiopathology; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Contrast Media; *Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate/blood; *Iohexol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The predominance  of beneficial bacteria in the gut microflora of breast-fed infants is thought to  be, at least in part, supported by the metabolism of the complex mixture of  oligosaccharides present in human breast milk, and a more adult-type intestinal  microbiota is found in formula-fed infants. Inadequate gut colonization,  dysbiosis, may lead to an increased risk of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune  disorders later in life. The addition of appropriate amounts of selected  prebiotics to infant formulas can enhance the growth of bifidobacteria or  lactobacilli in the colonic microbiota and, thereby, might produce beneficial  effects. Among the substrates considered as prebiotics are the oligosaccharides  inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, and lactulose. There  are some reports that such prebiotics have beneficial effects on various markers  of health. For example, primary prevention trials in infants have provided  promising data on prevention of infections and atopic dermatitis. Additional  well-designed prospective clinical trials and mechanistic studies are needed to  advance knowledge further in this promising field.","2009-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","S61-70","","5","155","","J Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19840609","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Risk Factors; Follow-Up Studies; Age Factors; Child, Preschool; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Breast Feeding; Probiotics/*administration & dosage; Bifidobacterium/*immunology/physiology; Immunity, Mucosal/*physiology; Infant Food/microbiology; Intestinal Absorption/immunology/physiology; Intestinal Mucosa/immunology/microbiology; Intestines/*drug effects/*immunology/microbiology; Lactobacillus/immunology; Term Birth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relatively little attention has been given to alternate routes by  which drugs may enter the eye. A system has been developed which allowed the  investigation in vivo of the contribution of noncorneal absorption to intraocular  drug levels after topical dosing. Using timolol and inulin as probe drugs, it was  shown that the noncorneal absorption route may contribute significantly to drug  penetration into intraocular tissues. Furthermore, results demonstrated that  drugs absorbed by the noncorneal route appeared to enter certain intraocular  tissues by a mechanism which bypasses the anterior chamber. These studies  suggested that intraocular penetration via noncorneal routes involves penetration  of drug across the conjunctiva/sclera. Neither reentry from the general  circulation after drug absorption into the blood or drug delivery by the local  vasculature accounted for the observed results. In terms of topical ophthalmic  drug delivery, the noncorneal absorption route may be important for drugs that  are poorly absorbed across the cornea due to their physical-chemical properties.

METHODS: We simultaneously evaluated Ccr, inulin clearance, and predicted GFR  calculated from serum creatinine level in 56 cirrhotic patients. Inulin clearance  was considered the gold standard for GFR evaluation. RESULTS: The sensitivity of  serum creatinine level, predicted GFR, and Ccr in detecting renal failure was  18.5%, 51%, and 74%, respectively. On the basis of inulin clearance, patients  were divided into two groups: those with normal GFR (mean, 106 +/- 34 mL/min per  1.73 m2) (group 1, 29 patients) and those with reduced GFR (mean, 56 +/- 19  mL/min per 1.73 m2) (group 2, 27 patients). Predicted GFR and Ccr were accurate  markers of GFR in group 1 patients, while both overestimated GFR by about 50% in  group 2 patients. An increased tubular secretion of creatinine accounted for the  disparity between Ccr and inulin clearance in these patients.

An increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) could  result from primary actions at the glomerular/vascular level or could be the  consequence of a primary increase in proximal tubular sodium reabsorption  resulting in systemic volume expansion. Recently it was hypothesized that an  increase in sodium reabsorption may lead to glomerular hyperfiltration through  the tubulo-glomerular feedback mechanism (tubular-hypothesis) without volume  expansion. DESIGN: We have studied 54 normoalbuminuric patients with type 1  diabetes. The GFR was measured by inulin clearance. Proximal and distal sodium  reabsorption were calculated according to standard formulas using the free water  clearance technique. Plasma volume, measured by the (125)I-albumin method, atrial  natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the second messenger cyclic  guanosine-3,5-monophosphate (c-GMP) were used as markers of extracellular volume  expansion. RESULTS: Glomerular hyperfiltration (GFR >or= 130 mL min(-1) 1.73  m(-2)) was present in 14 out of 55 patients with diabetes (25%). There were no  differences in plasma volume between normo-(NF) and hyper-filtrating (HF)  patients (2933 +/- 423 in NF vs. 3026 +/- 562 mL in HF, NS). Also plasma ANP and  c-GMP levels were not significantly different between the groups. The fractional  proximal reabsorption of sodium was significantly increased in HF [fPRNa(+) (%)  90.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 91.5 +/- 1.6, P = 0.02]. There were no differences in distal  sodium reabsorption or distal sodium load (approximately macula densa  concentration of NaCl) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the  primary event in diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration is an increase in proximal  tubular sodium reabsorption. They do not support the hypothesis that systemic  volume expansion or ANP mediate glomerular hyperfiltration in patients with  normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetes. As such, changes in tubular sodium handling  most probably influence tubulo-glomerular feedback.","2005-05","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","330-336","","5","35","","Eur J Clin Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15860045","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Prospective Studies; Absorption; Sodium/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Cyclic GMP/blood; Diabetic Nephropathies/metabolism/physiopathology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/metabolism/*physiopathology; Plasma Volume/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of concern is whether intrabronchial microdialysis  disrupts the integrity of the respiratory epithelium and thereby alters drug  penetration into the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF). The objective of  this study was to investigate the effect of intrabronchial microdialysis on the  integrity of the bronchial epithelium. Microdialysis sampling in PELF in proximal  (n = 4) and distal bronchi (n = 4) was performed after intravenous inulin and  florfenicol administration in anaesthetized pigs. Inulin was used as a marker  molecule of permeability of the epithelium, and florfenicol was used as test  drug. Bronchial tissue was examined by histopathology (distal and proximal  bronchi) and gene expression analysis (RT-qPCR, proximal bronchi) at the  termination of the experiment (6.5 hr). The microdialysis probe caused overt  tissue trauma in distal bronchi, whereas no histopathological lesions were  observed in proximal bronchi. A moderate up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory  cytokines IL1B, IL6 and acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A was seen in proximal  bronchi surrounding the microdialysis probes suggesting initiation of an  inflammatory response. The observed up-regulation is considered to have limited  impact on drug penetration during short-term studies. Inulin penetrated the  respiratory epithelium in both proximal and distal bronchi without any  correlation to histopathological lesions. Likewise, florfenicol penetration into  PELF was unaffected by bronchial histopathology. However, this independency of  pathology on drug penetration may not be valid for other antibiotics. We conclude  that short-term microdialysis drug quantification can be performed in proximal  bronchi without disruption of tissue integrity.","2015-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","242-250","","4","117","","Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25827198","","","","Female; Animals; Models, Animal; Administration, Intravenous; Permeability; Swine; Inflammation Mediators/metabolism; Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism; Insulin/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; *Respiratory Tract Absorption; Bronchi/injuries/*metabolism; Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism; Lung Injury/etiology/genetics/*metabolism; Microdialysis/adverse effects/*instrumentation; Respiratory Mucosa/injuries/*metabolism; Serum Amyloid A Protein/genetics/metabolism; Thiamphenicol/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Principal attention is given to  the mechanisms underlying a transient rise in urinary sodium and chloride  concentrations during the onset of diuresis. When the data are corrected for  washout artifacts from the pelvis and ureter, it can be shown that the initial  collection periods are associated with a transient increase in free-water  production and by the simultaneous secretion of urea from the interstitium into  the tubular fluid. The former coincides in time with the rise in urinary chloride  concentration and represents an augmentation of water reabsorbed in the  collecting duct, which is relatively impermeable to chloride. Both responses are  quantitatively consistent with the transition from a hyperosmotic to isosmotic  medullary interstitium.","1975-05","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1304-1312","","5","228","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1130534","","","","Animals; Time Factors; Dogs; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Kidney/metabolism; Body Water/*metabolism; Potassium/urine; Sodium/urine; Chlorides/urine; Water-Electrolyte Balance; Phosphates/urine; Urea/urine; *Diuresis/drug effects; Diuretics/pharmacology; Electrolytes/blood/*urine; Kidney Concentrating Ability/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The metabolic rate of the  cortex and outer medulla fell to 69% of control after TC, as measured by the heat  accumulation rate. Further reduction to basal metabolic level (30% of control)  was reversibly produced by elevating ureteral pressure, suggesting that the high  metabolic rate was caused by continued active reabsorption of sodium chloride at  about half the control rate. Thus Cin greatly underestimated glomerular  filtration rate in the TC-damaged kidney.

The clinical assessment of this function  is performed based on the measurement of fractional phosphate excretion (FEPi),  which is a quantity specifying the proportion of the filtered amount of  phosphates which is excreted in the urine. This quantity may provide useful  information about the involvement of kidneys in phosphate homeostasis of the  internal environment. This study focuses on the comparison of a kr(FEPi) value  examined based on a ratio of a phosphate clearance (CPi) and a creatinine  clearance (CKr) marked kr(FEPi), and a value calculated based on a ratio of CPi  and an exactly measured GFR as an inulin clearance (Cin), marked as in(FEPi).The  goal of comparing the two methods of examining FEPi was to establish to what  extent it is possible to evaluate the degree of inhibition of tubular phosphate  transport in residual nephrons based on a simple examination of kr(FEPi) .  METHODOLOGY: The examination of in(FEPi) and kr(FEPi) was carried out for 53  patients with CKD. The values of the examined quantities were as follows: SKr  199±45 µmol/l; SPi 1.41±0.29 mmol/l; CKr 0,95±0.36 ml/s/1.73 m2; Cin 0.71±0.25  ml/s/1.73 m2. For the purpose of comparison a cohort of 18 healthy volunteers was  examined. RESULTS: For individuals with CKD an average value of kr(FEPi) equalled  29.1±10.9% and in(FEPi) 52.4±4.3%. The values of in(FEPi) were higher than  kr(FEPi) (p<0.001) for all patients, although an average CPi value for patients  with CKD did not significantly differ from the control cohort (0.22 vs 0.21  ml/s/1.73 m2). The values of in(FEPi) increased proportionally to SKr values and  at higher values SKr (>300 µmol/l) they gradually approached 100% (indicating the  complete inhibition of tubular reabsorption of phosphates in residual nephrons).  The values of in(FEPi) were higher in all patients with CKD than kr(FEPi) as  expected, likely because the value CKr decreases at a slower rate than Cin (GFR)  in individuals with CKD as a result of increased tubular secretion of creatinine  in residual nephrons. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the  assumption that, provided the values of kr(FEPi) which are easily measurable in  clinical practice have reached 50-60%, almost complete inhibition of tubular  reabsorption of phosphates in residual nephrons must be assumed and no favourable  effect of phosphatonins on renal phosphate excretion can be expected. When  looking for new possibilities of inhibition of tubular phosphate reabsorption,  potential adverse effects of phosphatonins on organs must be considered.","2015-12","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1034-1038","","12","61","","Vnitr Lek","","","","","","","","cze","","","","","","","Place: Czech Republic PMID: 26806498","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Creatinine/metabolism; Kidney Tubules/*metabolism; Phosphates/*metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*metabolism/physiopathology; Renal Reabsorption/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the  pathophysiologic basis for variations in urine flow rates in ARF. This study was  designed to determine whether differences in residual levels of glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) or differences in tubular reabsorption of filtered solutes  and H2O accounted for the variations in urine flow rates among ARF patients.  Twenty-five patients with ARF of 3 to 6 days duration having ischemic and  nephrotoxic etiologies, increasing serum creatinines of more than 0.7 mg/dL/d,  urine sodium concentrations and fractional excretions of sodium (FENa) of more  than 20 mEq/L and more than 1%, respectively, 12 hours after stopping diuretics  and urine sediments consistent with acute tubular necrosis were studied. Urine  and serum collections were made over an 8-hour period to determine creatinine  clearance (Ccr), filtered osmolar load, urine to serum creatinine ratio (U/Scr),  urine to serum creatinine osmolality (U/Sosm), and FENa. These were compared with  urine flow rates. Creatinine clearance was validated as an estimate of GFR in ARF  with simultaneous inulin clearances x 12 measurements (r = 0.935, P < 0.001).  Residual Ccr was strongly correlated with urine flow rate (r = 0.857, P < 0.001),  as was filtered osmolar load (r = 0.810, P < 0.001). However, the latter  relationship was totally dependent on Ccr. There was no correlation between  U/Scr, U/Sosm, or FENa and urine flow rates. It is concluded that the residual  level of GFR is the primary determinant of variations in urine flow rate in  patients with ARF.","1994-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","788-793","","6","23","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8203359","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Absorption; Urine; Osmolar Concentration; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Sodium/metabolism; Kidney Tubules/*physiopathology; *Urodynamics; Acute Kidney Injury/*physiopathology/urine; Kidney Tubular Necrosis, Acute/physiopathology/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New-born pigs were loaded with glucose and fructose in order to determine  the maximal tubular transport rate of these substances. Significant changes at  birth occur in only a few functions of the tubulus system. Following delivery,  major changes are: (1) the increased reabsorption of sodium and water which is  probably the most important adaptation to extra-uterine life; (2) an apparent  increasing impermeability of the tubular epithelium for creatinine, and (3) the  direction of transport of fructose, which is reabsorbed by fetuses whereas  neonates demonstrate a net secretion. Glucose and fructose are transported by  different mechanisms. The experiments with fructose-loaded piglets demonstrate  that there are at least two transport mechanisms for fructose: reabsorption -  either passive or active - and secretion.

Muscle-stripped tissues from fed  or 48-h fasted piglets were mounted in Ussing chambers. Neural blockade with  tetrodotoxin (TTX) or antagonists of muscarinic or nicotinic receptors caused  reductions in basal short-circuit current that were approximately threefold  greater in fasted piglets. The TTX-induced reduction in short-circuit current in  fasted piglets was due to a decrease in residual ion flux and was abolished in  the absence of HCO(-)(3). Intestinal paracellular permeability, as indicated by  tissue conductance (G(t)) and fluxes of inulin and mannitol, was significantly  increased by fasting. TTX increased inulin flux and G(t) in fed but not fasted  piglets. In fasted piglets, carbachol reduced G(t) by 29% and mannitol flux by  27% but had no effect on these parameters in the fed state. We conclude that  fasting enhances enteric neural control of basal ion transport and increases  paracellular permeability in piglet jejunum.

The increase in phenobarbital: inulin clearance ratio was  significantly higher than the increase in the digoxin: inulin clearance ratio  (4.9 fold vs 1.66 fold) (p less than 0.005). Mannitol diuresis did not  significantly affect inulin clearance, nor digoxin protein binding during the  experimental period while there was a significant increase in PAH clearance.  Significant correlations were found between urine flow rate and digoxin renal  clearance or digoxin: inulin clearance ratio. The increase in the ratio drug:  inulin clearance with diuresis correlated inversely with the initial ratio;  animals with more predominant net reabsorption had a higher increase in ratio.  These studies suggest that the mannitol-induced increase in digoxin clearance  stems from a combination of increased renal blood flow enhancing digoxin  secretion, and increased urine flow rate inhibiting its reabsorption. We conclude  that urine flow rate and renal blood flow are important determinants of the renal  clearance of digoxin, independent of GFR.

The purpose of this study was to  address this issue. The overall mass transfer-area coefficient (KoA) was used for  the estimation of vancomycin hemodialysis clearance. A population pharmacokinetic  (popPK) model was developed, resulting in a fixed-effect parameter for  nonhemodialysis clearance of 0.316 liters/h. This popPK model was externally  evaluated, with a resulting mean absolute error of 13.4% and mean prediction  error of -0.17%. KoA-predicted hemodialysis clearance was prospectively evaluated  for vancomycin (n = 10) and meropenem (n = 10), with a correlation equation being  obtained (slope of 1.099, intercept of 1.642; r = 0.927, P < 0.001). An  experimental evaluation using an in vitro hemodialysis circuit validated the  developed model of KoA-predicted hemodialysis clearance using vancomycin,  meropenem, vitamin B(6), and inulin in 12 hemodialysis settings. This popPK model  indicated a maximum a priori dosing for vancomycin-a loading dose of 30 mg/kg,  which achieves the target AUC for 24 h after first dose with a probability of  93.0%, ensured by a predialysis concentration of >15 μg/mL. Maintenance doses of  12 mg/kg after every hemodialysis session could achieve the required exposure,  with a probability of 80.6%.

Although a substantial amount of solute moves into the blood compartment, back  clearance does not drastically decrease with increase in QF.

After the meat load (2 g.kg-1 body weight of cooked  unsalted red meat), GFR increased by 26.9% (peak value) over baseline in healthy  subjects and by 32% in CRF patients. The acid-base status of the healthy subjects  was in the normal range, whereas the CRF patients disclosed a slight metabolic  acidosis. After a meat load, there was, in the healthy subjects, an increase in  the filtered load of bicarbonate coupled to an enhanced tubular reabsorption and  urinary excretion. The time course between bicarbonate load and urinary excretion  was coincident. In CRF patients, the increase of bicarbonate tubular load after  the meal was associated with an increase in tubular reabsorption but not in  urinary excretion of this anion. The relationship between bicarbonate load and  reabsorption was linear in both groups up to the highest filtered loads. Baseline  titratable acidity (TA) and ammonium (NH4+) excretion (expressed per ml GFR) were  increased in CRF patients as compared with control subjects, but no changes were  found after the meat load in both groups in these experimental conditions. The  data indicate that the renal tubules contribute to the maintenance of acid-base  balance both in healthy subjects and in CRF patients by reabsorbing most of the  additional bicarbonate load. The transient, but significant, increase in  bicarbonate excretion observed in healthy subjects could be related to the  increased tubular load of bicarbonate. In CRF patients, tubular bicarbonate  reabsorption was more complete, possibly because of the stimulation of H+  secretion by the mild metabolic acidosis. TA and NH4+ did not participate in  tubular compensation of the increased buffer load.","1997-05","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","784-792","","5","8","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9176848","","","","Adult; Humans; Reference Values; Time Factors; Kidney/*metabolism; Absorption; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney Tubules/metabolism; Acids/*metabolism; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Bicarbonates/metabolism/urine; Dietary Proteins/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*diet therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology; Meat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In mammals, endogenous creatinine  is widely used as an indicator of renal glomerular dysfunction. However, avian  species produce primarily creatine. Here, renal creatine, (99m)Tc99-DTPA  (diethylenepentaacetic acid, DTPA) and 99mTc-MAG3 (mercaptoacetyl triglycine,  MAG(3)) renal clearances are characterized in the pigeon avian model by infusing  DTPA with inulin and creatine with each tracer and examining the slope of their  blood disappearance curves. Clearance curves for inulin and DTPA were parallel,  suggesting DTPA is cleared by renal filtration. MAG(3) clearance (slope: -2.74 ×  10(5), r(2) = 0.97) had a slope almost 10-fold steeper than for DTPA (slope:  -6.29 × 10(4), r(2) = 0.90), and orders of magnitude steeper than for creatine  (slope: -1.4, r(2) = 1.0). These results suggest that DTPA is cleared by  glomerular filtration like inulin, while MAG3 is filtered and actively excreted  in a manner similar to mammals. In contrast, creatine is filtered and resorbed,  has a larger volume of distribution (V(d)), or exhibits a greater blood protein  binding, making it more complex as a renal marker, when compared with creatinine  handling in mammals. The two radiotracers can be readily adapted for use in  birds, inviting both qualitative and semiquantitative functional evaluation of  avian renal function for research and clinical purposes. The elimination of  creatine appears to be more complex requiring further study.","2020-01-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","891-896","","4","50","","J Zoo Wildl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31926520","","","","Animals; Kidney/*metabolism; Oligopeptides/*metabolism; Contrast Media/pharmacokinetics; inulin; 99mTc-DTPA; 99mTc-MAG3; avian; Columbidae/*metabolism; creatine; Creatine/*metabolism; Pentetic Acid/*pharmacokinetics; Polyethyleneimine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; technetium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: We enrolled 106 patients,  including 56 males, aged 21.9 (standard deviation 9.2) years with 13.7 (9.1)  years' duration of diabetes and a mean haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ) of 7.7% (61  mmol/mol).

The  capillary and mesothelial membranes are modeled using pore theory and a dual  pathway (through pores and across cells) for fluid transfer. The nonperitoneal  tissues are modeled as a single body pool. Lymphatic uptake from the peritoneal  cavity is included. Model parameters were found from the literature and by  simultaneously fitting experimental data for dialysate volume and dialysate  concentrations of blood urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine, and inulin. The model  was also shown to predict concentration gradients within several tissues  surrounding the peritoneal cavity. Variation of the model parameters revealed the  importance of the mesothelial cell layer in peritoneal ultrafiltration.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We  compared 20 Type 1 diabetic (DM1) patients without microalbuminuria with 15  weight-, age-, and sex-matched healthy controls (C). Clearances of  para-aminohippuric acid (CPAH), inulin (Cin), lithium, sodium, and urinary  nitrite/nitrate (NOx), cGMP and bradykinin excretion rates were measured in two  90-min periods: a glycaemic clamp-induced euglycaemia (5 mmol/l-period I) and  hyperglycaemia (12 mmol/l-period II) (Study 1) and during time-controlled  euglycaemia (5 mmol/l-period I and 5 mmol/l-period II) to avoid the effects of  time and volume load (Study 2). RESULTS: Cin and CPAH were not significantly  different during euglycaemia (period I of Study 1) in DM1 and controls, whereas  fractional excretion of sodium was decreased in DM1 (1.84 +/- 0.75 vs. 2.36 +/-  0.67%; P < 0.05) due to an increase in fractional distal tubular reabsorption of  sodium (94.01 +/- 1.94 vs. 92.24 +/- 2.47%; P < 0.05). A comparison of changes  during Study 1 and Study 2 revealed acute hyperglycaemia did not change renal  haemodynamics significantly, while fractional distal tubular reabsorption of  sodium increased (DM1: P < 0.05; C: P < 0.01) and fractional excretion of sodium  decreased (P < 0.01) in both groups. The urinary excretion rates of NOx were  comparable during euglycaemia in DM1 and C. While in C, they significantly  increased during Study 1 (period I: 382 +/- 217 vs. period II: 515 +/- 254  nmol/min; P < 0.01) and Study 2 (period I: 202.9 +/- 176.8 vs. period II: 297.2  +/- 267.5 nmol/min; P < 0.05) as a consequence of the water load, no changes were  found in DM1. The urinary excretion of bradykinin was lower in DM1 compared with  C (0.84 +/- 0.68 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.85 micro g/min; P < 0.01) during euglycaemia; it  was not affected by hyperglycaemia. There were no significant differences between  DM1 and C and in cGMP urinary excretion rates following hyperglycaemia.  CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that DM1 without renal haemodynamic  alterations is associated with impaired renal sodium handling. Moreover, we did  not find a relationship between the renal excretion rates of vasoactive mediators  and sodium handling due to hyperglycaemia.","2004-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","968-975","","9","21","","Diabet Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15317600","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Blood Glucose/analysis; Hyperglycemia/*metabolism; Insulin/analysis; Glucose Clamp Technique/methods; Hemodynamics/physiology; Sodium/*metabolism; Nitric Oxide/*metabolism; Absorption/physiology; Bradykinin/*urine; Cyclic GMP/*urine; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*metabolism/physiopathology/urine; Diuresis/physiology; Kidney/*metabolism/physiopathology; Urination/physiology; Water/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the antigenic targets and functional  characterization of IgA have been incompletely defined in this disease. DESIGN,  SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study was performed in sera from  patients who were studied as part of a prospective, observational study of IgAN.  These patients (n=22) all had biopsy-proven IgAN within 3 years of study  initiation, complete clinical data, annual urinary inulin clearance for GFRs, and  at least 5 years of follow-up. Progression was defined as loss of >5 ml/min per  1.73 m(2) per year of inulin clearance measured over at least 5 years. A protein  microarray was used for detection of IgAN-specific IgA autoantibodies in blood  across approximately 9000 human antigens to specifically identify the most  immunogenic protein targets that drive IgA antibodies in IgAN (n=22), healthy  controls (n=10), and non-IgAN glomerular diseases (n=17). Results were validated  by ELISA assays in sera and by immunohistochemistry in IgAN kidney biopsies.  IgA-specific antibodies were correlated with clinical and histologic variables to  assess their effect on disease progression and prognosis. RESULTS: Fifty-four  proteins mounted highly significant IgA antibody responses in patients with IgAN  with a false discovery rate (q value) of ≤10%; 325 antibodies (P≤0.05) were  increased overall. Antitissue transglutaminase IgA was significantly elevated in  IgAN (P<0.001, q value of 0%). IgA antibodies to DDX4 (r=-0.55, P=0.01) and ZADH2  (r=-0.48, P=0.02) were significantly correlated with the decline of renal  function. Specific IgA autoantibodies are elevated in IgAN compared with normal  participants and those with other glomerular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In this  preliminary study, IgA autoantibodies target novel proteins, highly expressed in  the kidney glomerulus and tubules. These IgA autoantibodies may play important  roles in the pathogenesis of IgAN.","2015-03-06","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","372-381","","3","10","","Clin J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 by the American Society of Nephrology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25542908  PMCID: PMC4348675","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Disease Progression; Prospective Studies; Area Under Curve; ROC Curve; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Autoantibodies/*blood; Immunoglobulin A/*blood; Antigens, Surface/immunology; Protein Array Analysis; *Epitope Mapping; *Epitopes; Blood Proteins/immunology; DEAD-box RNA Helicases/immunology; DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology; Glomerulonephritis, IGA/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology; GTP-Binding Proteins/immunology; Homeodomain Proteins/immunology; IgA nephropathy; Membrane Proteins/immunology; Muscle Proteins/immunology; nephritis; Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology; primary GN; Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2; RNA Polymerase II/immunology; TEA Domain Transcription Factors; Transcription Factors/immunology; Transglutaminases/immunology; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renal hemodynamics increase strikingly in human  pregnancy. To test the hypothesis that these alterations are not potentially  harmful, clearances of inulin, p-aminohippurate, and neutral dextrans were  measured at 16- and 36-wk gestation, then 4 mo postpartum, in 11 normotensive  women.

METHODS: Endothelial cells were cultured in  a hollow fiber apparatus and continuously exposed to a flow. Transendothelial  electrical resistance and permeability to [14C]sucrose and [14C]inulin were used  to monitor the integrity of the endothelial monolayer. RESULTS: Under these  experimental conditions, measurements of insulin permeability, investigated at  increasing hormone concentrations, suggested that the predominant  transendothelial insulin fluxes were attributable to bidirectional convective  transport rather than to a saturable transport mechanism, in agreement with in  vivo experiment results published earlier. Analytical determinations of insulin  catabolism demonstrated a low percent of insulin degradation by the endothelium,  leading to production of insulin metabolites qualitatively identical to those  produced by human monocytes.

Among the different approaches to achieve targeted drug release  to the colon, the use of polymers especially biodegradable by colonic bacteria  holds great promise. Polysaccharidases are bacterial enzymes that are available  in sufficient quantity to be exploited in colon targeting of drugs. Based on this  approach, various polysaccharides have been investigated for colon-specific drug  release. These polysaccharides include pectin, guar gum, amylose, inulin,  dextran, chitosan, and chondroitin sulphate. This family of natural polymers has  an appeal to drug delivery as it is comprised of polymers with a large number of  derivatizable groups, a wide range of molecular weights, varying chemical  compositions, and, for the most part, low toxicity and biodegradability yet high  stability.

Differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray  powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron  microscopy showed that the drug was present as amorphous material entrapped  within the carrier matrix. Eight tablet blends were prepared using different  effervescent mixture ratios with or without binder and lubricant/glidant mixture.  All of the blends had acceptable flowability, acceptable effervescence times and  immediate drug release that could not be achieved by any of the control formulas.  The formula of choice contained 40% effervescent mixture, 5% starch, 1% boric  acid, 1% aspartame and sufficient lactose. The relative bioavailability (RB) of  risperidone from this formula was 161.41% with a significantly higher extent of  absorption compared to the market conventional tablets. This formula may be  promising in improving patient compliance and drug efficiency.","2016","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","297-306","","1","23","","Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24833273","","","","Humans; Animals; Rabbits; Half-Life; Bioavailability; Solubility; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Tablets; Patient Compliance; dissolution; Drug Compounding; Excipients; solid dispersion; Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; factorial design; psychiatric patients; Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy; Risperidone/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphometric analysis demonstrated well-preserved  ultrastructure after 90 min of perfusion. After luminal perfusion for 90 min the  absorption was constant with time and reached steady state within 5 min (177 +/-  7 fg.min-1.mm-1). Also the hydrolysis rate and tubular accumulation rate were  constant and averaged 84 +/- 8 and 93 +/- 10 fg.min-1.mm-1, respectively. Free  125I appeared already within 5 min of perfusion and reached steady state within  10 min. From proximal tubules perfused with 125I-insulin for 30 min and chased  for 60 min, a compartmental analysis revealed two compartments; half time (t1/2)  for delivery of insulin to the lysosomes was determined to be 8.5 min, and t1/2  for lysosomal degradation was 72 min. The results demonstrated that  internalization by endocytic invaginations, incorporation in endocytic vacuoles,  fusion with lysosomes, and hydrolysis were rapid processes and reached maximum  rates within few minutes. A significant transtubular transport of insulin to the  peritubular compartment was determined to be a constant rate of 11.2 +/- 0.7  fg.min-1.mm-1. Perfusion of tubules with insulin at high concentrations in the  perfusate revealed that the transport was dependent on the absorbed amount and  not on the perfused load, compatible with transport through the cells and not via  a paracellular mechanism. The intactness of the tight junctions was supported by  the following: 1) [14C]inulin leak did not increase with time and 2) enzyme-free  intercellular spaces were evident after perfusion for only 5 min with  microperoxidase (mol wt of 1,700). The transported 125I-insulin was  trichloroacetic acid precipitable and immunoprecipitable.","1992-05","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","F813-822","","5 Pt 2","262","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1590426","","","","Female; Animals; Rabbits; Time Factors; Perfusion; Hydrolysis; Biological Transport; Microscopy, Electron; Kidney Tubules/*metabolism/ultrastructure; Insulin/*pharmacokinetics; Peroxidases/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subjects consisted of 12 healthy volunteers, 18 patients with  membranous nephropathy, and 20 patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. In  membranous nephropathy, FCsDex measured with large dextrans (radii larger than 56  A) increased as the capillary lesion progressed. Histologic examination showed  that glomerular capillary alteration was the factor most closely linked to  changes in FCsDex in membranous nephropathy. Proteinuria (normalized to  glomerular filtration rate) did not correlate with FCsDex. Increased FCsDex  tended to normalize during prednisolone treatment in membranous nephropathy. In  immunoglobulin A nephropathy, the impairment of glomerular size selectivity  depended on the degree of mesangial sclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury. FCs  of dextrans of 59 A were correlated with the mesangial sclerosis index (r =  0.573, p = 0.050) and the tubulointerstitial injury index (r = 0.707, p = 0.003).  Proteinuria (again normalized to glomerular filtration rate) was significantly  correlated with FCs of large dextrans in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (r = 0.668,  p = 0.008). We conclude that glomerular size-selective barriers were impaired  both in membranous nephropathy and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. However, the  mechanisms of impaired size selectivity might differ, at least in part, between  these nephropathies. The predominant factors responsible for the size-selective  defect seemed to be glomerular capillary wall lesions in membranous nephropathy  but mesangial sclerosis or tubulointerstitial damages (or both) in immunoglobulin  A nephropathy.","1994-01","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","94-101","","1","123","","J Lab Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7507157","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney/*pathology; Dextrans/pharmacokinetics; Glomerulonephritis, IGA/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology; Glomerulonephritis, Membranous/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology; Prednisolone/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Models having a water-only (WO) pathway and continuous  distributions of microvascular transport-pathway sizes were fit to solute  reflection-coefficient (sigma) experimental data (approximately 0.5-16 nm Stokes  radii) obtained from skeletal muscle to determine optimal parameter values.  Without further modification, these models were used to predict experimental PS  values obtained from the literature for small solutes ranging in size from NaCl  to inulin and for three proteins, alpha-lactalbumin, ovalbumin, and albumin  (approximately 0.23-3.7 nm radii). The protein PSs were determined from  fluorescent tracer-diffusion curves and a nonlinear model of tracer diffusion in  the cat hindlimb preparation. The model's PS predictions were compared to those  of a discrete-pore model previously developed and a fiber-matrix (FM) model.  RESULTS: A log-normal (LN) continuous pore-size distribution plus WO-pathway  model (three free parameters) fit the sigma data to within the 95% confidence  intervals of each of eight solutes spanning a 32-fold size range and was nearly  as close to the data as was the two discrete-pore plus WO-pathway model (four  free parameters). Both models closely described the PS data for nine solutes  spanning a 14-fold size range. The fit of a fiber-matrix plus WO-pathway model  (three free parameters) to the sigma data was much poorer than for the other  models. CONCLUSIONS: The LN and two-discrete-pore models accurately describe  sigma and PS experimental data in cat and human skeletal muscle. Therefore,  experimental data resulting from complex microvascular transport processes are  well characterized by simple pore models.","1998","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","275-280","","4","5","","Microcirculation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9866118","","","","Humans; Animals; Permeability; Cats; *Models, Biological; Microcirculation; Surface Properties; *Computer Simulation; Body Water/metabolism; Albumins/pharmacokinetics; Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics; Lactalbumin/pharmacokinetics; Muscle, Skeletal/blood supply/*physiology; Ovalbumin/pharmacokinetics; Sodium Chloride/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this work was to compare cultured endothelial and  epithelial cells with respect to the function of their tight junctional complexes  in regulating the movement of macromolecules and ions across the cell monolayers,  and define functional parameters to characterize the tight junctional complexes.  Bovine aorta endothelial cells and T84 colonic carcinoma epithelial cells were  cultured on a microporous membrane support. The permeability coefficients of  inulin, albumin, and insulin were determined with the cell monolayers and  compared with the permeability coefficients obtained with 3T3-C2 fibroblasts, a  cell line that does not generate tight junctions. Electrical resistance  measurements across the monolayer-filter systems were also compared. The  permeability coefficient of albumin across the endothelial cell monolayer  compared favorably with other reported values. Likewise, the electrical  resistance across the T84 cell monolayer was in good agreement with published  values. Utilizing permeability coefficients for macromolecules as an index of  tight junction function, we found that a distinction between a lack of tight  junctions (fibroblasts), the presence of endothelial tight junctions, and the  presence of epithelial tight junctions was readily made. However, when utilizing  electrical resistance as an index of tight junction function, identical  measurements were obtained with fibroblasts and endothelial cells. This indicates  that more than one index of tight junction function is necessary to characterize  the junctional complexes. Although structurally similar, epithelial cell and  endothelial cell tight junctions perform very different functions, and, from our  data, we conclude that the demonstration of tight junctional structures by  electron microscopy is not relevant to the functional nature of the junction:  structure does not imply function. A minimal assessment of tight junction  function should rely on both the determination of the electrical resistance  across the cell monolayer, and the determination of the permeability coefficients  of selected macromolecules.","1990-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","498-504","","3","144","","J Cell Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2391379","","","","Animals; Cells, Cultured; Cattle; Biological Transport/physiology; Macromolecular Substances; Epithelial Cells; Cell Communication/physiology; Epithelium/metabolism/physiology; Electrolytes/*pharmacokinetics; Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism/physiology; Intercellular Junctions/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most authors found acute  'blunted increases' in GFR after dietary stresses, whereas others found acute  decreases. In hypertensive patients showing hyperfiltration, a contradictory  situation was observed; the traditionally observed 'blunted increase' in GFR and  increase in the intraglomerular pressure were neither accompanied by a change in  albumin excretion nor by an expected dynamic GFR response after administration of  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors. We are of the opinion that the  traditional clinical methods for assessing acutely provoked changes in renal  function have been inappropriate and that an approach based on the  two-compartment model of pharmacokinetics is more adequate for studying dynamic  clearance changes within clinically feasible time horizons. Such test evaluations  performed in patients within a washout period, and after long-term treatment with  various drugs enable one to assess the efficacy of the therapeutic regimens  especially in patients showing apparently normal or increased baseline clearances  in hyper filtering kidneys.","2002-09","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","241-249","","3","13","","Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Saudi Arabia PMID: 18209420","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vivo, the endothelium is potentially the primary site of  uptake of IGFs or IGF-IGFBP complexes from blood for transport to the  extravascular space. However, the pathway and mechanisms by which IGFs cross the  endothelial cell barrier are not known. The presence of high affinity receptors  for IGF-I and IGF-II on human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells was  demonstrated by (i) radio-receptor assays using both IGF-I and IGF-II and (ii)  affinity label cross-linking studies. In addition, Western ligand blotting and  immunoblotting revealed that IGFBP-2, -3, and -4 are secreted into serum-free  media conditioned by confluent HUVE cell monolayers. To study transendothelial  migration of IGF-I, HUVE cells were grown on microporous membranes in a bichamber  system. When compared with membranes without cells, HUVE monolayers restricted  the passage of 125I-IGF-I and [3H]inulin, whereas the control Madin Darby canine  kidney (MDCK) cell line virtually excluded all passage of these molecules.  Transport of 125I-IGF-I across HUVE cell monolayers was not significantly  different to that of [3H]inulin, a paracellular probe. Moreover, 125I-IGF-I  transport was not inhibited by either excess unlabelled IGF-I or a monoclonal  antibody to the type I IGF receptor at a concentration shown to inhibit  125I-IGF-I binding to HUVE cell monolayers. Our findings show that the movement  of free IGF-I across HUVE cell monolayers occurs via a paracellular route and not  by a receptor-mediated, transcellular pathway.","1997-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","290-298","","3","170","","J Cell Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9066786","","","","Humans; Animals; Dogs; Blotting, Western; Ligands; Microscopy, Electron; Biological Transport/physiology; Cell Culture Techniques/methods; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Iodine Radioisotopes; Antibodies/pharmacology; Binding, Competitive/physiology; Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure; Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism; Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry/pharmacology; Endothelium, Vascular/chemistry/*cytology/ultrastructure; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/analysis/metabolism; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules, Distal/cytology; Receptor, IGF Type 1/immunology/metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/analysis/pharmacokinetics; Umbilical Veins/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on this, we hypothesized that folate would enter the RPE via FR alpha and  exit the cell via RFT-1. To test this, we performed in vitro transport assays  using ARPE-19 cells cultured on permeable supports. The cells were grown for 4  weeks and electron microscopic analysis indicated that the cells have the  phenotypic features of normal RPE cells including apical microvillous processes  and junctional complexes. Measurement of transepithelial resistance showed that  the resistance increases in the cells as they differentiate over several weeks.  Transport assays showed that ARPE-19 cells transport folate in a basal-to-apical  direction, but do not transport this vitamin significantly in the apical-to  basal-direction. This was not a diffusional process, as the paracellular markers  inulin and sucrose were transferred across the cell monolayer at a much lower  level. The presence of FR alpha in the basal membrane was demonstrable by folate  binding and that of RFT-1 in the apical membrane by blockade of folate transport  by RFT-1-specific antibody. This study represents the first in vitro  demonstration of transcellular transfer of folate across RPE and suggests that  folate is transported from the choriocapillaris to the adjacent photoreceptor  cells in vivo by the concerted action of FR alpha in the basal membrane and RFT-1  in the apical membrane.","2002-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","129-138","","2","24","","Curr Eye Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12187485","","","","Humans; Cell Line; Antibody Specificity; Biological Transport/drug effects; Carrier Proteins/metabolism; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Antibodies/pharmacology; Protein Isoforms/metabolism; *Receptors, Cell Surface; Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored; Folic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/metabolism; Pigment Epithelium of Eye/cytology/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum cystatin C (cysC) has been proposed as an alternative  endogenous marker of GFR showing higher correlation to standard clearance methods  such as inulin or iohexol clearance. We compared serum crea and cysC levels in  n=127 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. The clearance of the iodinated  contrast dye iopromide served as reference method for GFR. Serum cysC was  determined by a particle-enhanced immunonephelometric method. CysC showed higher  non-parametric correlation (r=0.805) to the iopromide clearance compared to crea  (r=0.652) and to the estimated GFR according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula  (r=0.690), which underestimated true GFR systematically. Receiver operating  curves revealed a greater area-under-the-curve (AUC) for cysC (0.957 vs. 0.801,  p<0.05). At a cut-off level of >1.3 mg/l cysC exhibited an 88% sensitivity and a  96% specificity for detecting renal dysfunction which was defined as an iopromide  clearance less than 80 ml/min/1.73 m2; best values for crea were 63% for  sensitivity and 80% for specificity at a cut-off of >1.2 mg/dl. In conclusion,  cysC detected reduced GFR more reliably and at an earlier stage in patients  undergoing cardiac catheterization allowing a better identification of patients  with renal dysfunction and those at risk for contrast damage.","2005-07-10","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","173-178","","2","102","","Int J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 15982481","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Aged, 80 and over; ROC Curve; Biomarkers/blood; Retrospective Studies; Creatinine/*blood; Cystatin C; Contrast Media/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Nephelometry and Turbidimetry; Cystatins/blood; *Cardiac Catheterization; Heart Diseases/blood/complications/diagnosis; Iohexol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/blood/complications/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used an intact  guinea pig trachea model to investigate the role of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO)  in altering the function of the airway epithelial barrier. EPO in the presence of  hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and bromide (Br(-)) catalyzes the production of  hypobromous acid (HOBr), which is felt to have a toxic effect on airway  epithelial cells. An intact guinea pig trachea was mounted on an apparatus in a  way that would allow the tracheal epithelium to be exposed to different  solutions. Following these exposures, a test solution containing (14)C-sucrose  (S), (3)H-inulin (I), and FITC-dextran-20 (D) was placed in the tracheal lumen  and positioned in the center of the segment for 90 minutes. Flux of these  molecules across the epithelial barrier into a bath was measured, and the  permeability (P) was calculated for each molecule to quantify epithelial barrier  function. Light and electron micrographic studies were performed to assess  cellular damage. We found that there was a dose response to EPO (in the presence  of fixed amounts of H(2)(O)(2) and Br(-)). EPO at 7.3 x 10(-7) M caused no  increase in P over controls (Ringer's solution alone) for S, I, or D (P> 0.05),  whereas EPO at 2.7 x 10(-6) M caused a significant increase in P over controls (P  = 0.008) for all test molecules. Light and electron micrographs of the latter  tracheas showed no evidence of microscopic changes despite the increased P.  Further testing verified that the increase in permeability was caused by the EPO  catalyzed reaction and not the individual substrates themselves, and that the  reaction was inhibited by a peroxidase inhibitor. We conclude that EPO can alter  the barrier function of the airway epithelium before gross cellular damage  becomes visible. We hypothesize that changes in the tight junctions are  responsible for the alteration in the barrier function of the airway epithelium  and that this may play an important role in the pathophysiology of mild asthma.","1996-03","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","159-166","","3","21","","Pediatr Pulmonol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8860070","","","","Male; Animals; Guinea Pigs; Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects; Epithelial Cells; Asthma/physiopathology; Eosinophil Peroxidase; Eosinophils/*enzymology; Epithelium/drug effects; Peroxidases/*pharmacokinetics; Trachea/*drug effects/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tubular mechanisms are unknown, but it  seems that increased reabsorption of sodium proximal to the main site of action  of atrial natriuretic factor (i.e., the inner medullary collecting duct) plays an  important role. We attempted to decrease the proximal reabsorption of sodium with  mannitol in patients unresponsive to atrial natriuretic factor. The results of  mannitol in such a group of patients has previously been conflicting. We studied  10 patients with massive, resistant ascites who were off diuretics and on a  20-mmol/day sodium diet for 7 days. Atrial natriuretic factor unresponsiveness  was confirmed by failure of a 2-hr atrial natriuretic factor infusion to induce a  natriuresis. The next day all patients received an infusion of 40 gm of mannitol  and subsequently a combined infusion of mannitol and atrial natriuretic factor.  Proximal reabsorption of sodium and water were evaluated by lithium clearance,  and glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow were evaluated by inulin  clearance and p-aminohippurate clearances, respectively. Six patients responded  to mannitol alone with an increased diuresis (from 39 +/- 7 to 148 +/- 35 ml/hr)  and natriuresis (from 0.27 +/- 0.05 mmol/hr to 1.65 +/- 0.53 mmol/hr; p less than  0.05) (responders), whereas four did not (nonresponders). The combination of  atrial natriuretic factor and mannitol induced a further significant increase in  sodium excretion (3.28 +/- 0.68 mmol/hr) but not in urine excretion, compared  with mannitol alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1992-07","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","42-48","","1","16","","Hepatology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1535608","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Infusions, Intravenous; Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood; Prothrombin Time; Bilirubin/blood; Kidney/drug effects/physiopathology; Aldosterone/blood; Norepinephrine/blood; Renin/blood; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Sodium/urine; Liver Cirrhosis/blood/*physiopathology/urine; *Atrial Natriuretic Factor/administration & dosage; *Mannitol/administration & dosage; Ascites/physiopathology; Liver Cirrhosis, Alcoholic/blood/physiopathology/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Renal haemodynamics and  tubular electrolyte handling were measured in 10 healthy overweight men (aged  20-27 years; BMI 26-31 kg/m(2)) during intravenous administration of placebo  (saline 0.9%), exenatide, and exenatide combined with the NO-synthase inhibitor  L-N(G)-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and  effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by inulin and  para-aminohippurate clearance techniques, respectively, based on timed urine  sampling. Glomerular hydrostatic pressure and vascular resistance of afferent and  efferent renal arterioles were calculated using the Gomez formulae. Urinary  electrolytes, osmolality and pH were also measured. RESULTS: GFR increased by a  mean of 18 ± 20 (+20%; p = 0.021) and ERPF increased by a median (interquartile  range) of 68 (26; 197) ml/min/1.73 m(2) (+14%; p = 0.015) during exenatide  infusion versus placebo. During L-NMMA infusion, exenatide increased GFR by mean  8 ± 12 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (+9%; p = 0.049). Exenatide increased estimated  glomerular pressure by +6% (p = 0.015) and reduced afferent renal vascular  resistance by -33% (p = 0.038), whereas these effects were blunted during L-NMMA  infusion. Exenatide increased absolute and fractional sodium excretion, urinary  osmolality and urinary pH. The tubular effects of exenatide were not altered by  concomitant L-NMMA infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide infusion in healthy  overweight men acutely increases GFR, ERPF and glomerular pressure, probably by  reducing afferent renal vascular resistance, and at least partially in an  NO-dependent manner. As baseline renal haemodynamics in patients with type 2  diabetes differ from those in healthy individuals, clinical studies on the renal  effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are warranted.","2016-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","178-185","","2","18","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26636423","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Young Adult; Infusions, Intravenous; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Body Mass Index; Exenatide; Vascular Resistance/*drug effects; nitric oxide; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology; renal haemodynamics; exenatide; GLP‐1 receptor agonist; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/*agonists/metabolism; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology; Kidney Tubules/blood supply/drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology; Kidney/blood supply/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology; L‐NMMA; Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; omega-N-Methylarginine/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Overweight/metabolism/*physiopathology/urine; Peptides/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology; Venoms/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  response to euglycemic insulin infusion was investigated in two homogeneous  patient groups with a slight renal impairment-one with nephrotic syndrome (GFR,  64 mL/min; N = 9) and one with non-nephrotic immunoglobulin A nephropathy (GFR,  70 mL/min; N = 8). In addition, nine renal transplant recipients (GFR, 44 +/- 6  mL/min) were investigated. The results were compared with those of 12 healthy  controls (GFR, 105 +/- 4 mL/min). Renal hemodynamics and renal tubular sodium  handling were estimated with inulin, p-aminohippurate, sodium, and lithium  clearances. The results showed that patients with nephrotic syndrome (5.0 +/- 0.4  mg/kg per minute) and renal transplant recipients (4.8 +/- 0.6 mg/kg per minute)  had a significant lower metabolic clearance of glucose as compared with control  subjects (7.9 +/- 0.4 mg/kg per minute), whereas patients with immunoglobulin A  nephropathy (6.7 +/- 0.6 mg/kg per minute) had a metabolic clearance of glucose  that was similar to that of the controls. Despite insulin resistance to  carbohydrate metabolism, insulin infusion still induced hypokalemia and  antinatriuresis in patients with nephrotic syndrome and renal transplant  recipients. Insulin infusion caused a significant 13% increase in RPF and lithium  clearance in control subjects, and a positive Spearman rank correlation (Rs =  0.41; P < 0.05) was observed between the changes in p-aminohippurate and lithium  clearances during insulin infusion in the combined patient group, suggesting that  impaired renal vasodilation may contribute to abnormal proximal tubular sodium  handling and sodium retention. The results also suggest that hypertriglyceridemia  could be a factor contributing to abnormal proximal tubular sodium handling in  chronic renal disease.","1995-04","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","1751-1760","","10","5","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7787142","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Blood Pressure; Blood Glucose/analysis; *Insulin Resistance; Lipids/blood; Hemodynamics; Apolipoproteins/blood; Potassium/blood; Sodium/*metabolism; *Renal Circulation; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Hormones/blood; Hyperlipidemias/blood/complications/*physiopathology; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*blood/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vitro, 2,4,5-T transport was effective, with tissue concentrations 20  times those in the medium after only 5 min of incubation with 1 microM 2,4,5-T.  The tissue to medium ratios reached steady state by 20 min at approximately  45-fold. Uptake was energy dependent and inhibited by ouabain, phloridzin and  several organic anions (probenecid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and  octanoate). Neither tyrosine (transported by a separate system) nor the  neurotoxin, quinolinic acid, inhibited 2,4,5-T transport. Kinetic analysis  yielded an apparent Km of 58 microM and Vmax of 111 nmol g-1 min-1 in the lateral  ventricular choroid plexus with similar values (57 microM and 87 nmol g-1 min-1)  in the fourth ventricular plexus. In vivo, the steady-state clearance of 2,4,5-T  from the cerebrospinal fluid exceeded that of inulin and was reduced in a  dose-dependent fashion by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and probenecid.  Together, these data indicate that 2,4,5-T is cleared from the brain and  cerebrospinal fluid by the organic anion transport system and that alterations in  such transport may have a significant impact on the toxicity of this agent in the  central nervous system.","1993-11","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","751-757","","2","267","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8246151","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Perfusion; Biological Transport/drug effects; Ouabain/pharmacology; Probenecid/pharmacology; *Blood-Brain Barrier; Phlorhizin/pharmacology; Choroid Plexus/*metabolism; 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid/cerebrospinal fluid/pharmacokinetics/toxicity; 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical experience with these techniques is, however, scanty, and the present  study explored their potential in subjects with and without renal dysfunction. In  a series of subjects, a single slice of kidney was scanned sequentially after the  bolus injection of contrast material. Time-attenuation curves were constructed,  and alpha/V and fvv were calculated using a Patlak graphic analysis. In the first  part of the study, 50 normal kidneys in 35 subjects (aged 21 to 75 years) were  studied. In the second stage, alpha/V was compared with glomerular filtration  rate (GFR) measurements in 24 patients with diabetes (aged 28 to 84 years) with  or without renal dysfunction. In normal kidneys, alpha/V averaged 0.49 +/- 0.11  mL/min/mL and fvv averaged 35% +/- 12%. These values agree with literature data  obtained using other techniques. A negative correlation was seen between age and  alpha/V (r = 0.66; P < 0.0001), but not fvv. In patients with diabetes, a strong  correlation was observed between renal clearance values, calculated from CT and  corrected for renal volume, and GFR (r = 0.87; P < 0.0001). Dynamic CT can  provide quantitative renal physiological information on a regional basis  noninvasively.","1999-04","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","754-760","","4","33","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10196020","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Contrast Media; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/metabolism; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods; Kidney Function Tests/*methods; Diabetes Mellitus/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; Diabetic Nephropathies/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; Iodine; Kidney Diseases/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; Kidney/diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transport  across BBMEC monolayers was examined for molecular weight markers and  chemotherapeutic agents ([(14)C]sucrose, [(14)C]inulin, [(3)H]propranolol,  [(3)H]doxorubicin, and [(14)C]paclitaxel) with Zot (0.0-4.0 microg/mL). TEER of  monolayers was measured to assess effect and reversibility of Zot. Cell viability  of BBMEC in the presence of Zot was assessed by trypan blue exclusion staining.  Apparent permeability (P(app)), enhancement ratio (R), and percent increase in  transport determined were statistically compared by ANOVA. A significant increase  (p < 0.05) in P(app) was observed for the transport of [(14)C]sucrose,  [(14)C]inulin, [(3)H]doxorubicin, and [(14)C]paclitaxel at a 4.0 microg/mL  concentration of Zot. A significant concentration-dependent decrease in TEER was  observed on treatment with Zot with rapid reversal to baseline after removal. Zot  (4 micro/ml) was found to be nontoxic to the BBMECs after 2 hours incubation. In  conclusion, Zot increased paracellular transport across the BBMEC in a  reversible, concentration-dependent manner. Modulation of paracellular transport  with Zot may be used to increase the brain permeability of potent central nervous  system-active drugs, including anticancer agents.","2003-02","2023-07-10 08:46:50","2023-07-10 08:46:50","","414-423","","2","92","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 92:414-423, 2003","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12532391","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Fluorescent Dyes; Permeability; Biological Transport, Active; Molecular Weight; Cattle; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis; Rhodamine 123/metabolism; Cell Survival/drug effects; Blood-Brain Barrier/*drug effects; Endotoxins; Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism; Capillaries/drug effects/metabolism; Cholera Toxin/*pharmacology; Tight Junctions/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
