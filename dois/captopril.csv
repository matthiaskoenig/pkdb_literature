Blood, urine, and bile samples were collected during and after drug  infusion. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were carried out exclusively on data  obtained for unchanged captopril. The average total body clearance (ClT) and the  renal clearance (ClR) of captopril, in milliliters per kilogram per hour, were  605 and 341 in the dog and 1135 and 944 in the monkey. The biliary clearance of  captopril was negligible in both species. The greater difference between the ClR  and ClT values in the dog compared to that in the monkey was the result of more  extensive metabolism of captopril by the dog. Since almost all of the radioactive  dose was recovered in urine in both species, captopril and its metabolites were  almost exclusively eliminated by the kidneys. One primary reason that body and  renal clearance values of captopril were much greater in the monkey than in the  dog was that the net tubular secretion fo captopril was about three times greater  in the monkey (82%) than in the dog (28%). The volume of distribution of  captopril was higher in the monkey (3.6 liters/kg) than in the dog (2.6  liters/kg); the volume of the central compartment was about the same (0.5  liter/kg) for both species. The terminal half-life value was slightly higher in  the dog (2.8 hr) than in the monkey (2.2 hr).","1981-10","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:55","","1108-1112","","10","70","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7028947","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Species Specificity; Half-Life; Dogs; Creatinine/blood; Macaca mulatta; Anesthesia; Bile/metabolism; Proline/*analogs & derivatives; Captopril/blood/*metabolism/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine standard pharmacokinetic parameters for the  drug in this population, we administered captopril, 1 mg/kg, orally to 10 infants  aged 6.8 +/- 4.6 months. Sequential plasma unchanged and total (sum of unchanged  and dimerized) captopril concentrations were determined using a high-performance  liquid chromatographic method. Arterial pressure, systemic and pulmonary  resistance, heart rate, and respiratory rate were all significantly decreased 1 h  after the first dose of captopril. Plasma renin activity was not significantly  increased. For unchanged captopril, the maximum concentration (Cmax) was 350 +/-  184 ng/ml; the time to Cmax (Tmax), 1.6 +/- 0.4 h; elimination half-life (t1/2),  3.3 +/- 3.3 h; oral clearance (Clo), 1.1 +/- 0.4 L/h/kg. For total captopril,  Cmax was 1,088 +/- 621 ng/ml; Tmax, 2.7 +/- 1.1 h; t1/2, 3.4 +/- 1.0 h. Thus, we  conclude that the pharmacokinetic parameters for captopril in infants with CHF  are within the range reported for adults with CHF. Also, the hemodynamic changes,  measured 1 h after the first dose, indicate that the acute effects of captopril  in infants with CHF are beneficial.","1991-05","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:36","","209-214","","3","13","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1926273","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Pilot Projects; Infant; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Respiration/drug effects; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Heart Failure/*metabolism/physiopathology; Captopril/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plasma concentrations of zofenopril and its  active metabolite zofenoprilat as well as serum ACE activity were measured before  drug intake (baseline) and on timed samples over a 36 h period after dosing by  LC-MS-MS, a highly sensitive, validated method for active moiety concentrations.  Peak plasma concentration was reached on average at 1.19 h with zofenopril and at  1.36 h with zofenoprilat. Concentrations then decreased reaching values under or  close to the limit of quantitation (1 ng.ml-1 for zofenopril, 2 ng.ml-1 for  zofenoprilat) from 8 to 16 h after dosing. Complete inhibition of ACE was seen at  the first blood sampling time (1 h) and lasted on average up to 9.44 h. ACE  activity then slowly reactivated, but enzyme inhibition continued and was  estimated to be 74% and 56% at 24 and 36 h following drug administration,  respectively.

Serum and urine digoxin concentrations were  determined before and after a repeated administration of captopril in the  patients on chronic digoxin therapy. The patients were taking digoxin, 0.25-0.375  mg/day, once daily, and were concurrently administered captopril, 37.5 mg/day,  three times daily, for seven days. Peak serum concentration of digoxin (SCD)  before and after captopril was 2.1 +/- 0.2, mean +/- SEM, and 2.0 +/- 0.1 ng/ml;  the time to peak was 1.1 +/- 0.2 and 1.8 +/- 0.3 h; the terminal half-life (t1/2  alpha) was 10.9 +/- 1.0 and 8.7 +/- 0.9 h, and the area under the  concentration-time curve to 24 h was 26.9 +/- 2.4 and 27.6 +/- 2.0 ng.h/ml. There  was no significant difference between patients without and with captopril in SCD  and its pharmacokinetic parameters. Renal digoxin clearance and creatinine  clearance also showed no significant difference. After an administration of  captopril, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) activity was well suppressed.  These results suggest that captopril does not increase SCD in patients with CHF,  and effectively suppresses ACE activity. Thus, modification in the dosage regimen  of digoxin may be unnecessary in the case of coadministration with captopril.","1991-04","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:24","","576-580","","4","17","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1711623","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Half-Life; Creatinine/blood; Kidney Function Tests; Captopril/*pharmacology; Heart Failure/*metabolism; Digoxin/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of food on  the pharmacokinetics of perindopril (4 mg administered orally) and the time  course of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in serum was studied in a  randomized crossover short-term study of 12 healthy subjects. Food significantly  decreased the relative availability of perindoprilat by 35% +/- 42%, the  fractional urinary excretion of perindoprilat from 19% +/- 7% to 13% +/- 4% (p  less than 0.05), and the partial metabolic clearance of perindopril to  perindoprilat from 102 +/- 57 ml.min-1 to 72 +/- 32 ml.min-1 (p less than 0.05).  These changes were associated with a significant decrease in the area under the  percent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition-versus-time curve by 15% (p less  than 0.05). Food did not alter the total amount of drug recovered in urine as  perindopril and its metabolites, and it did not alter perindoprilat renal  clearance.

Captopril pharmacokinetic parameters were  not modified by RI, with the exception of elimination half-life which was  lengthened, but relative bioavailability of the drug was not modified. In  contrast, captopril-induced CEI was strongly potentiated in patients with RI, an  effect correlated with plasma creatinine values. This apparent discrepancy  between the lack of modification in captopril plasma bioavailability and the  prolongation of its biological effects can probably be accounted for by a  decreased elimination and/or an increased formation of captopril metabolites  during RI.","1984-10","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:46","","1216-1219","","11","77","","Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 6098233","","","","Adult; Humans; Kinetics; Middle Aged; Creatinine/blood; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Hypertension/*metabolism; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism; Hypertension, Renal/metabolism; Proline/*analogs & derivatives; Captopril/blood/*metabolism/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Paracetamol and captopril were chosen as the internal  standard of erdosteine and its active metabolite, respectively. Aliquots of 100  microL plasma sample were derivatized by 2-bromine-3'-methoxy acetophenone, then  separated on an Agilent XDB-C18 (50 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 1.8 microm) column using 0.1%  formic acid methanol--0.1% formic acid 5 mmol x L(-1) ammonium acetate as mobile  phase, in a gradient mode. Detection of erdosteine and its active metabolite were  achieved by ESI MS/MS in the positive ion mode. The linear calibration curves for  erdosteine and its active metabolite were obtained in the concentration ranges of  5-3 000 ng x mL(-1) and 5-10 000 ng x mL(-1), respectively. The lower limit of  quantification of erdosteine and its active metabolite were both 5.00 ng x  mL(-1). The pharmacokinetic results of erdosteine and its thiol-containing active  metabolite showed that the area under curve (AUC) of the thiol-containing active  metabolite was 6.2 times of that of erdosteine after a single oral dose of 600 mg  erdosteine tables in 32 healthy volunteers, The mean residence time (MRT) of the  thiol-containing active metabolite was (7.51 +/- 0.788) h, which provided a  pharmacokinetic basis for the rational dosage regimen.","2013-03","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:18:56","","395-400","","3","48","","Yao Xue Xue Bao","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 23724654","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Area Under Curve; Chromatography, Liquid; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Thioglycolates/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Thiophenes/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: Dissolution studies were performed using Apparatus 1 (Basket), DT 800H,  Erweka, Germany in acidic medium (0.01 N hydrochloric acid) and an agitation  speed of 50 rpm. Experiments were run on 12 tablets of each formulation.  Quantification of Captopril was achieved by using a spectrophotometric method,  λ=205nm. Clinical pharmacokinetics was determined in the frame of four different  bioequivalence studies comparing a single dose four different Captopril 50mg  generic tablet products to the innovator drug, Capoten 50mg (Bristol Myers  Squibb). RESULTS: Different batches of the reference formulations achieved  dissolution profiles of the same form and very closed to each other at all  dissolution points. Dissolution profiles of the tested formulations shown similar  behavior for all references. Two generic formulations achieved a slower release  at early dissolution time points, their release being ""diffusion controlled"",  described by law of Higuchi. In vivo, products proved to be bioequivalent, but  variability of space distribution and forms of plasma profiles was much bigger  than for the in vitro release curves. Due to very rapid in vitro dissolution, a  direct Level A in vitro-in vivo correlation was not possible, but, strangely, the  fraction absorbed vs. time clearly followed the same Higuchi law. CONCLUSION: All  the studied formulations achieved more than 85% dissolution after 15 minutes  which means that whatever the values of dissolution metrics f1 and f2,  formulations behave like a solution and generally should not have therapeutic  equivalence problems. Slower dissolution profiles correlates with in vivo  absorption being described by the same square root law of Higuchi which describe  diffusion controlled transport phenomena.","2017-09","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:17:07","","214-219","","3","43","","Curr Health Sci J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Romania PMID: 30595878  PMCID: PMC6284848","","","","bioequivalence; captopril formulations; release kinetics; square root law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  pharmacokinetics of this agent have been studied extensively in healthy subjects  and in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal  failure. Captopril contains a sulphydryl group and binds readily to albumin and  other plasma proteins. The drug also forms mixed disulphides with endogenous  thiol-containing compounds (cysteine, glutathione), as well as the disulphide  dimer of the parent compound. These components in blood and urine are measured  collectively as total captopril. Because of the reversibility of the formation of  these inactive disulphides, total captopril may serve as a reservoir of the  pharmacologically active moiety, and thus contribute to a duration of action  longer than that predicted by blood concentrations of unchanged captopril. To  measure free or unchanged captopril concentrations, a chemical stabiliser must be  added to the biological samples to prevent the formation of captopril disulphides  ex vivo. In healthy subjects given captopril intravenously, the body clearance of  captopril and steady-state volume of distribution were about 0.7 L/h/kg and 0.8  L/kg, respectively. The elimination half-life of unchanged captopril was  approximately 2 hours. The primary route of elimination of captopril is the  kidney. The renal clearance of unchanged captopril exceeds the glomerular  filtration rate, due to active tubular secretion of the drug. In healthy  subjects, about 70 to 75% of an oral dose is absorbed and the bioavailability of  captopril is approximately 65%. Peak blood concentrations are reached about 45 to  60 minutes after oral administration. The bioavailability of captopril is not  altered by age or concomitant medications including diuretics, procainamide,  allopurinol, cimetidine or digoxin. However, the co-administration of food or  antacids, or probenecid with captopril has been shown to diminish the  bioavailability of the latter and decrease its clearance, respectively. The  decreased bioavailability of captopril when taken with meals does not  significantly alter clinical responses to the drug. Over a wide range of oral (10  to 150 mg) and intravenous doses (2.5 to 10 mg) captopril had linear kinetics in  healthy volunteers. In healthy subjects with normal renal function and patients  with congestive heart failure given captopril 3 times daily, blood concentrations  of total captopril accumulated, whereas those of unchanged captopril did not.  Severe renal insufficiency was associated with an accumulation of both unchanged  and total captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1988-04","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:18:29","","241-259","","4","14","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 3292102","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Animals; Drug Interactions; Age Factors; Drug Administration Routes; Hypertension/*metabolism; Heart Failure/*metabolism; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism; Captopril/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical studies have shown that  M100240 is capable of decreasing ACE activity and angiotensin II concentrations  while increasing plasma renin activity and potentiating the effects of atrial  natriuretic peptide. This may result in a unique treatment benefit in disease  states characterized by intravascular volume or sodium overload or increased  venous pressure. The pharmacokinetics of MDL 100,173 were evaluated in 30 healthy  subjects in an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover design. Subjects  received a single oral dose of 50 mg of M100240 administered with a high-fat meal  and separately under fasted conditions. Serial plasma concentrations of M100240  and MDL 100,173 were analyzed, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated  with noncompartmental methods. The intrasubject percent coefficient of variation  for MDL 100,173 C(max) and AUC(0-24h) were less than 20%, indicating that this  agent is a moderately variable drug. Although AUC(0-24h) was within the  protocol-defined range of 80% to 125%, the lower limit of the 90% confidence  interval for C(max) fell outside of the 70% to 143% range. Absence of a food  effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of 50 mg of M100240 could therefore not be  demonstrated. This finding is not surprising based on the documented food effect  with the sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, captopril. Clinical significance of  this pharmacokinetic food effect is unlikely, as the magnitude of pharmacodynamic  response is probably better correlated with AUC than a single-point determination  of C(max). Single oral doses of 50 mg of M100240 were safe and well tolerated  under fed and fasted conditions.","2004-12","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:17:21","","1379-1384","","12","44","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15545308","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Administration Schedule; Fasting/physiology; Dietary Fats/administration & dosage; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Eating/drug effects/physiology; Prodrugs/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Benzazepines/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Food/*classification; Guidelines as Topic/standards; Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Pyridines/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On day 1 of a 7-day  medication period, subjects received a loading dose of digoxin 0.5 mg in the  morning, followed by an evening dose of digoxin 0.25 mg, either alone or together  with telmisartan 120 mg administered in the morning. On the subsequent 6 days,  either digoxin 0.25 mg or digoxin 0.25 mg together with telmisartan 120 mg was  administered once daily in the morning. Each 7-day medication period was  separated by a washout period of > or = 14 days. A steady-state plasma  concentration-time profile was assessed for digoxin during each period and for  telmisartan during the period with the combined treatment. Multiple-dose  telmisartan administered with digoxin resulted in higher serum digoxin  concentrations than those observed after digoxin given alone. Geometric mean  AUC144-168, Cmax, and Cmin values for digoxin when given in combination with  telmisartan were higher by 22%, 50%, and 13%, respectively, compared with values  when given alone. However, the 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean of  Cmin was within the predefined 80% to 125% range of no interaction. During  combination medication, digoxin tmax was shorter and Cmax/AUC144-168 increased,  suggesting that the rise in digoxin Cmax may be due to more rapid drug  absorption. Study medications were well tolerated, with the incidence, nature,  and intensity of adverse events being similar during both medication periods.  Also, no changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory tests were observed during  the study. Although there was some evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction  between digoxin and telmisartan found in this study, the safety and tolerability  of digoxin were unaffected by concurrent administration of telmisartan in the  study population. Since any symptoms of overdose are related only to steady state  and not peak concentrations and due to the fact that there was a lack of effect  on serum trough levels of digoxin in this study, it is unlikely that the findings  have any clinical relevance. The magnitude of increase in digoxin concentrations  is comparable with increases observed with administration of calcium antagonists,  carvedilol, ACE inhibitors such as captopril, and antiarrhythmic drugs such as  amiodarone, quinidine, and propafenone. Monitoring of serum digoxin  concentrations should be considered when patients first receive telmisartan and  in the event of any changes in telmisartan dose.","2000-12","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:20:01","","1373-1379","","12 Pt 1","40","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11185636","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Cross-Over Studies; Digoxin/*pharmacokinetics; Telmisartan; Cardiotonic Agents/pharmacokinetics; Benzimidazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology; Benzoates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition the time required for  that inhibition to return to 50% of the difference between maximum and zero  (control values) was measured as an estimate of duration of action. The 5 ACEis  (with dosages given in parentheses) were benazapril (0.5 mg/kg), captopril (2.0  mg/kg), enalapril (0.5 mg/kg), lisinopril (0.5 mg/kg), and ramipril (0.25 mg/kg).  Blood samples for ACE activities were obtained before dosing and at 1.5, 3.0,  6.0, 12.0, and 24.0 hours after dosing. All ACEis except captopril decreased ACE  activities to approximately 25% of control by the 1.5- to 3.0-hour sample, and  ACE activities returned to 50% of the difference by the 12-hour sample. The value  of AVE activity returned to normal by 24 hours for benazapril, whereas values for  ACE activity remained below normal for enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril at 24  hours. For captopril, however, ACE levels decreased to approximately 80% of  control by the 1.5-hour recording, and returned to levels not different from  control by the 3-hour recording. Based upon this study performed on normal dogs  given a single dose, no pharmacokinetic advantage or disadvantage is apparent for  any ACEi except captopril, which, at the dosage used, decreased ACE levels to a  much lesser degree and shorter time.","1998-04","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:18:45","","93-95","","2","12","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9560765","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Dogs; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*blood; Benzazepines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Captopril/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Lisinopril/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Ramipril/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplement : official journal of the International Society of Hypertension","","0952-1178","","","The clearance of drugs excreted entirely unchanged by the kidneys is assumed to relate directly to renal function. The clearance of drugs which are entirely  metabolized is usually not altered in patients with renal impairment, although  there are examples of both increased and decreased metabolic clearance rates. The  clearance of metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the kidneys is also  directly related to renal function. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril and quinapril are prodrugs that are  rapidly converted to active metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the  kidneys. Studies have consistently demonstrated reduction in the apparent oral  clearance of the active metabolites, in proportion to the degree of impairment of  renal function. In addition, for quinapril at least, the metabolic clearance of  the parent drug is slightly reduced in renal impairment. The activity of  captopril and lisinopril lies in the parent molecule itself. Lisinopril is  excreted renally unchanged, while captopril is both metabolized and excreted  renally unchanged. The duration of ACE inhibition after administration of any of  the ACE inhibitors is prolonged in proportion to the degree of renal impairment.  From these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, it follows that the  dose rate of the ACE inhibitors should be reduced in direct proportion to the  degree of reduction in renal function. Reducing the dose, rather than prolonging  the dose interval, is more logical for compliance and for maintaining a  consistent degree of ACE inhibition over 24 h.","1989-09","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:17:14","","S29-32","","5","7","","J Hypertens Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2681603","","","","Humans; Time Factors; Osmolar Concentration; Creatinine/metabolism; *Tetrahydroisoquinolines; Quinapril; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this trial zofenopril calcium and enalapril maleate (CAS  76095-16-4) were given to 20 healthy volunteers of both sexes in repeated dose  regiment at two dose levels: 30 mg and 60 mg zofenopril calcium and 10 mg and 20  mg enalapril maleate. The study was conducted according to a two-period,  two-sequence, crossover design, with washout. ACE activity in serum and  zofenopril, zofenoprilat, enalapril and enalaprilat plasma concentrations were  determined during and on the last day of the two study periods. Both zofenopril  and enalapril were extensively converted through hydrolysis to their active  metabolites zofenoprilat and enalaprilat, respectively. Zofenopril exhibited a  complete and a more rapid hydrolysis rate compared to enalapril, which is  reflected by the higher metabolite to parent drug ratio of Cmax and AUCss, tau  showed by this compound. Even though only two dose levels were investigated in  this trial, the pharmacokinetics of both drugs seem to be linear. In line with  previous trials, both compounds at both dose levels investigated produced  complete or almost complete inhibition of ACE activity in serum, for a period  lasting 6-8 h after administration, the inhibition being still relevant 24 h  thereafter. The tolerability of the two drugs at both dose levels proved to be  very good as demonstrated by subjective and objective symptoms, by the absence of  relevant adverse events, and by laboratory biochemical parameters and vital signs  evaluated before and after the trial. Blood pressure showed a fairly decreasing  trend with both the drugs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values being  however within normal range in all the subjects. In no case symptoms of  hypotension were experienced. In conclusion, zofenopril calcium and enalapril  maleate show very good tolerability and appear to exert similar activity on serum  ACE. The main difference in the pharmacokinetics of the two compounds is the  conversion from pro-drug to the active metabolite which is faster with  zofenopril.","2002","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:17","","233-242","","4","52","","Arzneimittelforschung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 12040965","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Area Under Curve; Biotransformation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Captopril/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Enalapril/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This intermittent partial ""escape"" is explained either by a renin-mediated  reactive rise in plasma Ang I or by non-ACE-dependent Ang II generation. We  therefore tested the hypothesis that a combination of ACE inhibition and Ang II  blockade may have additive biological and hemodynamic effects. METHODS AND  RESULTS: In a single-dose, double-blind, randomized, four-way, crossover study,  an Ang II antagonist (losartan 50 mg), an ACE inhibitor (captopril 50 mg), their  combination, and matched placebos were orally administered to 12 normotensive  male volunteers maintained in mild sodium depletion. When captopril 50 mg and  losartan 50 mg were given alone, the magnitude of their effects on blood  pressure, plasma active renin, Ang I, and aldosterone was similar, whereas the  kinetics of their effects were different, reflecting differences in drug  pharmacokinetics. The losartan-captopril combination completely suppressed the  rise in plasma Ang II induced by losartan 2 hours after drug intake (3.3 +/- 3.6  pg/mL versus 20.3 +/- 19.1 pg/mL, respectively, P < .05). Six hours after drug  intake, the losartan-captopril combination induced a significantly greater  decrease in mean blood pressure than that produced by either losartan or  captopril alone (73 +/- 7 mm Hg versus 79 +/- 8 mm Hg versus 81 +/- 7 mm Hg,  respectively, P < .05). The maximum placebo-subtracted falls in mean blood  pressure for the losartan-captopril combination, captopril 50 mg, and losartan 50  mg were 14 +/- 5 mm Hg, 10 +/- 3 mm Hg, and 9 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively (F2.22 =  3.45, P < .05). The duration of the mean blood pressure fall was not prolonged by  the combination. After combined losartan-captopril administration, the area under  the plasma active renin versus time curve (0 to 24 hours) was significantly  increased when compared with either losartan or captopril alone (6404 +/- 2961  pg.h.mL-1 versus 3105 +/- 1461 pg.h.mL-1 versus 2092 +/- 867 pg.h.mL-1,  respectively, P < .05). The combination had no additive effects on plasma  aldosterone decrease when compared with either losartan or captopril alone (58  +/- 17% versus 51 +/- 20% versus 53 +/- 21%, respectively, NS). CONCLUSIONS: The  combined administration of a standard single oral dose of an ACE inhibitor and an  Ang II antagonist to mildly sodium-depleted normal subjects (1) had a major  additive effect on plasma renin rise, (2) induced an additional mean blood  pressure reduction, and (3) had no additive effect on plasma aldosterone fall.","1995-08-15","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:17:12","","825-834","","4","92","","Circulation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7641363","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Reference Values; Drug Synergism; Double-Blind Method; Cross-Over Studies; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Hydrocortisone/blood; Renin/*blood; Heart Rate; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Aldosterone/blood; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood; Angiotensin I/blood; Angiotensin II/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood; Sodium/*deficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated its  pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in 8 healthy men: Increasing doses  of 1, 5, and 25 mg idrapril as well as placebo or 5 mg captopril were  administered intravenously (i.v.) at 1-week intervals. Six of the subjects  received 100 mg idrapril orally (p.o.) last, and two ingested oral placebo as a  double-blind control. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) remained unchanged.  No serious side effects were observed. ACE inhibition in vivo was evaluated by  changes in the ratio of specifically measured plasma angiotensin II (AngII) and  AngI concentrations determined by high-performance liquid  chromatography/radioimmunoassay (HPLC/RIA) techniques. Plasma ACE activity in  vitro was estimated by radioenzymatic assay; it was suppressed by > or = 93% at  15 min after injection of 25 mg idrapril or 5 mg captopril and by 96% 2 h after  idrapril intake. Mean AngII levels were decreased dose dependently at 15 min  after idrapril injections. At the same time, plasma renin activity (PRA) and AngI  increased according to the doses. The AngII/AngI ratio was clearly related to  plasma idrapril levels (r = -0.88, n = 60). Oral idrapril inhibited ACE maximally  at 1-4 h after dosing, when < 7% of initial ACE activity was observed in vitro  and in vivo. Idrapril is a safe and efficient ACE inhibitor in human subjects. It  is well absorbed orally. Besides having a slightly slower onset of action,  idrapril has pharmacodynamic effects comparable to those of captopril.","1994-08","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:20:16","","317-322","","2","24","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7526067","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Double-Blind Method; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood; Renin/blood; Captopril/pharmacology; Angiotensin II/blood; Zinc/metabolism; Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Hydroxylamines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-198510050-00001","","The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. In  addition, they are useful pharmacological probes to assess the contribution of  the renin-angiotensin system to circulatory homeostasis. Captopril was the first  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor approved for use in patients with  hypertension and congestive heart failure. It is rapidly absorbed from the  gastrointestinal tract, with detectable plasma concentrations apparent as early  as 15 minutes. The extent of absorption is between 60 and 75% of an oral dose and  peak plasma concentrations occur after approximately one hour. Captopril is  primarily excreted by the kidneys via renal tubular secretion. Renal excretion is  rapid, with 90% completed in the first 4 hours. The elimination half-life for  unchanged captopril is about 1.7 hours and is markedly increased in the presence  of renal insufficiency. Once absorbed, captopril is extensively metabolised to  several forms, including a disulphide dimer of captopril, a captopril-cysteine  disulphide, and other mixed disulphides with endogenous thiol compounds. It is  probable that captopril and its pool of metabolites undergo reversible  interconversions. Pharmacokinetic properties of captopril in patients with  uncomplicated hypertension appear to be the same as in healthy subjects. However,  long term administration of captopril leads to increased concentrations of total  captopril, probably from the accumulation of captopril metabolites. Despite the  number of potential influences on pharmacokinetic properties in patients with  congestive heart failure, due to the many abnormalities in gastrointestinal tract  oedema and reductions in splanchnic and renal blood flow, the available data  suggest that its pharmacokinetic properties in patients with congestive heart  failure resemble those in healthy subjects. However, additional data are  necessary to confirm this. Enalapril is the second angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitor to become available. Enalapril is a prodrug that is well absorbed from  the gastrointestinal tract, with 60 to 70% of an oral dose being absorbed.  However, enalapril must be converted by hepatic esterases to the active form,  enalaprilat. After the oral administration of enalapril, the tmax for enalapril  is one hour, but for enalaprilat it is 4 hours. There is a prolonged terminal  elimination phase with enalaprilat being detectable as late as 96 hours after  dosing. Thus, enalapril has a much longer duration of action than captopril. Like  captopril, enalapril is primarily excreted by the kidneys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT  400 WORDS)","1985-10","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:03","","377-391","","5","10","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2994938","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Intestinal Absorption; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tissue Distribution; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Hypertension/drug therapy/physiopathology; Enalaprilat; Heart Failure/drug therapy/physiopathology; Captopril/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Enalapril/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans these metabolites are excreted in the  urine. The presence of the indanyl-glycine moiety gives delapril a high  lipophilicity, greater than several other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors, such as captopril and enalapril. Due to its greater lipophilicity,  delapril has been shown to exert a more effective inhibition of vascular ACE than  captopril and enalapril, both in vitro and in vivo. The activity of delapril on  tissue ACE also lasts longer than on the circulating enzyme. At doses ranging  from 1-10 mg/kg orally, delapril exerts a marked and long-lasting  antihypertensive action in various experimental models of hypertension. The blood  pressure reduction has been shown to be accompanied by suppression of angiotensin  II release from the vascular wall. In stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive  rats (SHR-SP) and in SHR with chronic renal failure, besides reducing  hypertension, delapril significantly improves survival rate and prevents the  development of stroke, cardiac hypertrophy, and renal sclerosis. The ability of  delapril to reduce hypertrophy in vascular and cardiac tissue has been  demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.","1995-06-16","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:42","","7F-12F","","18","75","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7778536","","","","Humans; Animals; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Indans/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that statistically  significant synergy with captopril and CP-80,794 occurred when the area rather  than the peak drop or duration of change in blood pressure was measured. The  degree of the synergy indicated that to achieve the same reduction in blood  pressure, the dose of each drug, below the high end of its response range, could  be decreased approximately sixfold when administered in combination. It was  determined that the plasma pharmacokinetics of CP-80,794 were not altered during  coadministration, as plasma concentrations of CP-80,794 were similar in the  presence and absence of 0.1 mg/kg i.v. of captopril.

It is concluded that  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition markedly reduced absolute reabsorption  in both the proximal and distal tubules in RVH, in contrast to EH, predominantly  due to fall in the GFR, and that the slight increase in proximal fractional  reabsorption may be attributed to a reduction in the hydrostatic pressure in the  peritubular vessels.","1989-04","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:35","","135-141","","2","19","","Eur J Clin Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2499471","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Hypertension/physiopathology; Captopril/*pharmacology; Aldosterone/blood; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Angiotensin II/blood; Hydrostatic Pressure; Hypertension, Renovascular/*physiopathology; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Glomerular  filtration rate decreased by 16%. Concomitantly, clearance of endogenous lithium  fell by 66%, and fractional proximal reabsorption of sodium increased from 77 to  92%; absolute proximal reabsorption rate of sodium remained constant. ANG II  decreased sodium excretion by 70%, potassium excretion by 50%, and urine flow by  80%, whereas urine osmolality increased. ANG III also increased plasma  aldosterone markedly (+45%), however, without measurable changes in angiotensin  immunoreactivity, glomerular filtration rate, or renal excretion rates.

The development of new ACE inhibitors such as  ramipril provides an opportunity to improve the knowledge on this class of drug,  and to optimize the benefit/risk ratio for the patient. Ramipril was selected  among several analogs because of its unique physicochemical properties. It is a  nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, and after oral absorption it is transformed in the  liver into its active metabolite ramiprilat, which is at least 23 times more  lipophilic than enalaprilat. Furthermore, the in vitro affinity of ramiprilat for  the enzyme is 7 times higher than for enalaprilat and 47 times higher than for  captopril. The ramiprilat-ACE complex is therefore very stable and dissociates 6  times more slowly than the enalaprilat-ACE complex and 22 times more slowly than  the captopril-ACE complex. Ramipril possesses a favorable pharmacokinetic profile  as a consequence of its physicochemical properties: its high potency allows the  use of very low doses, and the slow dissociation of the ramipril-ACE complex  explains the long duration of its action, permitting a once-daily treatment.  Dose-finding studies have confirmed that very low doses of ramipril--2.5 mg once  a day--can be used as a first-step treatment of hypertension.

We also studied the effect of  chronic renal failure on the plasma concentration of AcSDKP during long-term ACE  inhibitor (ACEI) treatment or in its absence. In healthy subjects, a single oral  dose of 50 mg captopril (n=32) and a 7-day administration of 50 mg captopril BID  (n=10) resulted in a respective 42-fold (range, 18- to 265-fold) and 34-fold  (range, 24-fold to 45-fold) increase in the ratio of urinary AcSDKP to creatinine  accompanied by a 4-fold (range, 2- to 6.8-fold) and 4.8-fold (range, 2.6- to  11.8-fold) increase in plasma AcSDKP levels. Changes in plasma AcSDKP and in  vitro ACE activity over time showed an intermittent reactivation of ACE between  each captopril dose. In subjects with chronic renal failure (creatinine  clearance<60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), plasma AcSDKP levels were 22 times higher (95%  confidence interval, 15 to 33) in the ACEI group (n=35) than the control group  (n=23); in subjects with normal renal function, they were only 4.1 times higher  (95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 5.3) in the ACEI group (n=19) than the non-ACEI  group (n=21). Renal failure itself led to a slight increase in plasma AcSDKP  concentration. In conclusion, intermittent reactivation of ACE between doses of  an ACEI is the major mechanism accounting for the lack of major AcSDKP  accumulation during chronic ACE inhibition in subjects with normal renal  function.","1999-03","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:17:13","","879-886","","3","33","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10082503","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Kidney/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/metabolism; Biomarkers/urine; Captopril/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood; Oligopeptides/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preliminary data suggest that cilazapril is of comparable  antihypertensive efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide,  slow release propranolol, nitrendipine, captopril and enalapril. In small studies  cilazapril has produced sustained beneficial haemodynamic effects in patients  with congestive heart failure. Cilazapril has been well tolerated and exhibits  tolerability typical of ACE inhibitors as a class, including their lack of  detrimental effect on glucose or lipid metabolism.

Antihypertensive treatment of arterial hypertension with angiotensin converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to be effective with a low incidence of  adverse effects compared with other drug classes. Furthermore, treatment with ACE  inhibitors may slow the progression of renal function impairment in certain  groups of patients, such as those with diabetes. Most ACE inhibitors are prodrugs  which are converted by hepatic esterolysis to an active diacid metabolite. Only  captopril and lisinopril have sufficient oral bioavailability and are given as  active drugs. ACE inhibitors can be subdivided into 3 classes with regard to the  active group: the majority of ACE inhibitors are carboxyl-containing drugs, a new  class of ACE inhibitors possess a phosphoryl-group and captopril and related  compounds are sulfhydryl-containing drugs. The predominant elimination pathway of  ACE inhibitors is excretion via the kidneys. Therefore, renal insufficiency is  associated with reduced elimination of most ACE inhibitors and, thus, altered  pharmacokinetic properties. This is most evident in chronic renal failure when  glomerular filtration rates (GFR) are < 30 to 40 ml/min (1.8 to 2.4 L/h). As  renal clearance decreases, the peak plasma concentration and area under the  plasma concentration-time curve of the active drugs or diacids are increased and  time to peak concentrations and half-life are prolonged. However, there are large  between-drug differences in the changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, resulting  in different degrees of drug accumulation after consecutive administration. This  leads, for example, to high accumulation rates for drugs such as lisinopril, or  cilazaprilat. In contrast, fosinopril, which is also excreted to a large extent  by the hepatobiliary pathway, does not seem to accumulate in renal failure. In  general, pharmacokinetics and conversion of prodrugs seem to be slightly affected  in chronic renal failure; however, these changes do not appear to be clinically  relevant. Efficiency of clearance for prodrugs or active drugs and their  respective metabolites by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis varies  considerably. For some ACE inhibitors, such as captopril or enalapril, the high  elimination fraction by haemodialysis necessitates a supplemental dose after  dialysis. Other ACE inhibitors, such as quinapril or cilazapril, are only poorly  eliminated by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Dosage recommendations for  treatment with ACE inhibitors in chronic renal failure depend on the specific  pharmacokinetic properties of the various agents. For most ACE inhibitors, dosage  adjustment is recommended in moderate and severe impairment of renal function,  with resultant dosages being 25 to 50% of those recommended for patients with  normal renal function.","1993-03","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:18:48","","230-254","","3","24","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 8462229","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Renal Dialysis; Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Hypertension, Renal/complications/drug therapy/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drug undergoes hepatic hydrolysis into its major active diacid metabolite,  quinaprilat, and two minor inactive metabolites. On a weight basis quinaprilat is  three times as potent an ACE inhibitor as quinapril. Approximately 60 percent of  an oral dose of quinapril is absorbed. In contrast with captopril, the absorption  of quinapril is unaffected by food. Peak serum concentrations of quinapril and  quinaprilat are achieved within one and two hours, respectively. Approximately 61  percent of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine, principally as  quinaprilat. The elimination half-life of quinaprilat is three hours, but is  prolonged up to 11 hours in patients with renal dysfunction. Quinapril dose  reduction is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of 0.50 mL/sec  or less. In the elderly the elimination of quinaprilat is reduced and correlates  well with renal function. In patients with cirrhosis the hydrolysis of quinapril  to quinaprilat is impaired resulting in lower plasma quinaprilat concentrations  and up to a two-fold increase in quinapril half-life. Quinaprilat has a strong  binding capacity to tissue ACE allowing for once-daily dosing. The recommended  starting dose for quinapril is 20 mg/d. The nature and incidence of adverse  reactions to quinapril are similar to those of enalapril and captopril.  Quinapril's antihypertensive efficacy is equal to that of captopril and  enalapril.

Reduction in blood pressure during  dilevalol administration is associated with peripheral vasodilatation, and heart  rate remains essentially unchanged. Following oral administration, dilevalol is  completely absorbed. Once-daily administration is possible, due to a long  elimination half-life. Large well-controlled trials reveal that dilevalol is  equivalent in antihypertensive efficacy to metoprolol, the ACE inhibitors  captopril and enalapril, and the calcium antagonist nifedipine. Smaller  noncomparative and comparative trials demonstrate the blood pressure-lowering  effects of dilevalol and suggest an efficacy at least equivalent to that of the  'pure' beta-blockers atenolol and propranolol and the alpha 1-blockers urapidil  and doxazosin. Dilevalol appears to be well tolerated, the most frequent adverse  effects being dizziness, headache and diarrhoea in only about 7% of patients  each. Unlike alpha 1-blockers and labetalol, dilevalol is not commonly associated  with orthostatic hypotension.

Before and during 10 to 12 weeks after withdrawal of the ACEI,  AZA metabolites, renal function parameters and hematological parameters including  erythropoietin and reticulocytes were evaluated. Enalaprilat levels were measured  and compared with 15 similar patients matched for transplant function and  enalapril dosage immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and prednisone. AZA  metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the ACEI.  Enalaprilat levels also showed no significant difference between the two patient  groups treated with AZA or cyclosporine. Hematocrit and hemoglobin increased  significantly from 37.5 +/- 6.4 to 39.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD, P = 0.02) and 12.8  +/- 2.2 to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl, P = 0.04, respectively, 10 to 12 weeks after ACEI  treatment had been discontinued. Simultaneously numbers of reticulocytes and  erythropoietin concentrations rose significantly after 2, 4 and 10 weeks, with a  peak at two weeks (from 14.1 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 8.0/1000, P < 0.05 and from 14.3  +/- 12.4 to 29.3 +/- 54.5 mU/ml, P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion,  ACEI-related anemia in renal transplant recipients seems to be due to the  erythropoietin-lowering effect of this group of drugs. A pharmacokinetic  interaction between AZA and enalapril is not likely since plasma enalaprilat  levels were independent of the immunosuppressive regimen and AZA metabolite  levels were unchanged in the presence and absence of the ACEI. Several mechanisms  by which angiotensin converting enzyme blockade may cause a decrease in  circulating erythropoietin are discussed.","1996-09","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:18:44","","973-978","","3","50","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8872973","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Drug Interactions; Hematocrit; *Kidney Transplantation; Cyclosporine/pharmacology; Hemoglobins; Anemia/*chemically induced; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics; Azathioprine/metabolism/pharmacology; Enalaprilat/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics; Erythrocytes/chemistry; Erythropoietin/blood; Immunosuppressive Agents/metabolism/pharmacology; Kidney Diseases/complications/drug therapy/surgery; Thioguanine/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Natural medicines are the main alternatives to  treatment for a majority of people suffering from hypertension. Niazicin-A,  Niazimin-A, and Niaziminin-B compounds from Moringa oleifera ethanolic leave  extract were reported to have potent antihypertensive activity. OBJECTIVE: These  compounds were targeted with Angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] which is one of  the main regulatory enzymes of the renin-angiotensin system. METHODS:  Protein-ligand docking of these compounds with [ACE] [both domain N and C] was  conceded out through Autodock vina and visualization was done by chimera.  Pharmacokinetics study of these compounds was predicted by ADME-Toxicity  Prediction. RESULTS: Niazicin-A, Niazimin-A, and Niaziminin-B showed high binding  affinity with ACE and partially blocked the active sites of the enzyme.  Niazicin-A, Niazimin-A and Niaziminin-B showed the estimated free binding energy  of -7.6kcal/mol kcal/mol, -8.8kcal/mol and -8.0kcal/mol respectively with  C-domain of ACE and -7.9kcal/mol, -8.5kcal/mol and -7.7kcal/mol respectively with  N-domain of ACE. The compounds showed better binding energy with  angiotensinconverting enzyme in comparison to Captopril -5.5kcal/mol and  -5.6kcal/mol and Enalapril [standard] -8.4kcal/mol and -7.5kcal/mol with C and N  domain, respectively. CONCLUSION: Computationally, the selected bioactive  molecules have shown better binding energy to known standard drugs which have  been already known for inhibition of ACE and can further act as a pharmacophore  for in vitro and in vivo studies in the development of alternative medicine.","2019","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:18:59","","239-248","","3","13","","Recent Pat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 30747089","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Substrate Specificity; Protein Binding; Gene Expression; Molecular Docking Simulation; Plant Leaves/chemistry; Patents as Topic; Thermodynamics; Catalytic Domain; angiotensin converting enzyme; Docking; captopril; and Moringa oleifera; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism; autodock vina; Captopril/chemistry/metabolism; Enalapril/chemistry/metabolism; hypertension.; Hypertension/drug therapy/enzymology; Moringa oleifera/*chemistry; Niazicin-A; Niazimin-A; Niaziminin-B; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Plant Extracts/chemistry; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Thiocarbamates/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  pharmacokinetics of drugs such as furosemide might be altered under hypoxic  conditions, making it essential to establish different dose-regimens to maintain  therapeutic efficacy or to avoid toxic side effects at high altitude.  Simultaneously, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) mediated by OAT1 occur at high  altitude, severely affecting furosemide pharmacokinetics. This study investigated  the influence of acute exposure to high altitude at 4300 m on the renal excretion  of furosemide in rats. Significant changes in physiological parameters and kidney  histopathology were found after acute high altitude exposure. Compared with low  altitude, the pharmacokinetics of furosemide and the expression level of OAT1 in  kidney were significantly changed after rapid ascent to high altitude.  Additionally, the down-regulated OAT1 expression further sustained the potential  mechanism for the decreased renal excretion of furosemide, resulting in extended  residence of the drug in the human body. The elevation of AUC, C(max) , MRT,  t(1/2) of furosemide, and decreased CL at high altitude further reinforced the  current findings. Moreover, the absorption of furosemide was markedly increased  and renal excretion significantly declined after co-administration of captopril,  resulting in local drug interaction at high altitude. In conclusion, acute  exposure to high altitude may significantly affect the renal excretion of  furosemide and the pharmacokinetic parameters of furosemide were altered after  co-administration of captopril, which may then impact the conventional  therapeutic dosage.","2018-09","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:12","","378-387","","8","39","","Biopharm Drug Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30120768","","","","Male; Animals; pharmacokinetics; Rats, Wistar; Kidney/*metabolism; *Altitude; Renal Elimination; Diuretics/*pharmacokinetics; captopril; furosemide; Furosemide/*pharmacokinetics; high altitude; OAT1; Organic Anion Transport Protein 1/genetics/metabolism; renal excretion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Captopril differs from both  enalapril and quinapril in that its chemical structure contains a sulfhydryl  group, the presence of which may be important in the development of adverse  reactions. Captopril also differs from enalapril and quinapril in its ability to  be metabolized in plasma. Enalapril and quinapril are both de-esterified, most  likely in the liver, to their active metabolites, enalaprilat and quinaprilat.  All 3 ACE inhibitors are eliminated primarily via renal excretion, and renal  dysfunction markedly increases the area under the time versus plasma  concentration curves. Hepatic dysfunction also slows the conversion of enalapril  and quinapril to their active metabolites. There is evidence that both captopril  and enalapril, but not quinapril, may accumulate with repeated dosing. The  pharmacokinetics of these agents are not significantly modified by  co-administration of other drugs. However, captopril does cause marked increases  in trough plasma levels of digoxin. Overall, the pharmacokinetic profiles of  captopril, enalapril, and quinapril make them suitable for a wide range of  patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure.","1992-04-02","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:20:09","","8C-16C","","10","69","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1546641","","","","Humans; Reference Values; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; *Tetrahydroisoquinolines; Quinapril; Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/metabolism; Enalapril/pharmacokinetics; Captopril/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During or following absorption, fosinopril, a prodrug, is hydrolyzed  pharmacologically to the active diacid, SQ 27,519. A specific radioimmunoassay  (RIA) for the measurement of SQ 27,519 in human serum has been developed. The  assay utilizes a specific SQ 27,519 antibody, 125I-iodohistamine-SQ 27,519  radiolabel, and human serum standards. Satisfactory zero binding and assay  sensitivity are achieved after a 2-h incubation at room temperature. Separation  of the antibody-bound and free radiolabeled antigens is achieved by using  polyethylene glycol-goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin separant. Recovery  efficiencies ranged from 97.2 to 109.4%.

A review of its pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacology.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199000391-00009","","Perindopril is an orally active, non-thiol angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which in doses of 4 to 8mg is effective in the control of essential  hypertension. As monotherapy it is as effective as once-daily atenolol and  possibly more effective than twice-daily captopril. A synergistic response has  been noted when perindopril is combined with a thiazide diuretic. Maximal  pharmacodynamic effects (ACE inhibition, increase in plasma renin activity and  angiotensin I, reduction in aldosterone and angiotensin II and blood pressure)  are seen 4 to 6 hours after dosing, with substantial effects still present at 24  hours. Perindopril is a prodrug which requires de-esterification to perindoprilat  for useful ACE inhibition. Maximal plasma perindoprilat concentrations are  reached 2 to 6 hours after oral administration of perindopril, and 70% of the  active metabolite is cleared by the kidneys. The other major metabolite of  perindopril is an inactive glucuronide. Ageing is associated with increased serum  perindoprilat concentrations, which are probably caused by a combination of  enhanced conversion to the active metabolite and diminished renal clearance.  Compensated cirrhosis does not appear to have an independent effect. There is  little published experience of the use of perindopril in patients with cardiac  failure or other cardiac disease, but preliminary evidence would support the  general value of this class of agent as adjunctive therapy.","1990","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:13","","49-63","","","39 Suppl 1","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2407493","","","","Humans; Animals; Hypertension/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Cardiac Output, Low/drug therapy; Perindopril; Indoles/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, maximal  ACE inhibition is observed 4-6 hours after oral dosing and substantial inhibition  persists beyond 24 hours. Inhibition of ACE is dose-dependent over the range 1-16  mg perindopril orally, and is mirrored by elevation of plasma renin activity and  falls in aldosterone concentrations. Blood pressure reductions have been  confirmed in normotensive and hypertensive subjects with maximal effect 6-10  hours after dosing and adequate antihypertensive activity at 24 hours. Blood  pressure reductions are greater in the elderly than in young subjects due to  pharmacokinetic differences. Dose reduction is required in elderly subjects and  those with renal impairment. The antihypertensive efficacy of perindopril 4-8 mg  once daily, is comparable to that of atenolol 50-100 mg once daily, captopril  25-50 mg twice daily or a hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride combination.

METHODS: Three groups of patients were studied. Group I  contained 22 patients with hypertension but a low likelihood of RAS according to  negative captopril renography results, confirmed by angiography in 5. Group II  contained 22 hypertensive patients with RAS documented by angiography and  positive captopril and plasma renin response. Group III contained 10 patients  after successful percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with negative  captopril renography results. The 60-min, single-sample technique was used for  measurement of the plasma clearance of MAG3 during baseline and captopril  renography.

The clearance decrease in group II did  not correlate with the blood pressure decrease or plasma renin activity increase  during captopril renography. CONCLUSION: Renal function assessed by MAG3 plasma  clearance decreases in hypertensive patients with RAS but increases in patients  without RAS. MAG3 clearance measurements during baseline and captopril renography  can thus serve as additional diagnostic information when investigating patients  with hypertension for the possibility of an RAS.","2000-07","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:28","","1203-1208","","7","41","","J Nucl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10914910","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; *Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics; Captopril/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; *Angioplasty, Balloon; *Radioisotope Renography; *Technetium Tc 99m Mertiatide/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension, Renovascular/diagnostic imaging/etiology; Renal Artery Obstruction/complications/*diagnostic imaging/therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also inhibits the effects of serotonin on platelets in  cardiovascular disease, inhibits vasoconstriction caused by the amine, and when  administered intravenously improves some haemorheological indices in patients  with ischaemic diseases. The antihypertensive effect of oral ketanserin 40 mg  twice daily is comparable with that of total daily doses of metoprolol 200 mg,  propranolol 160 mg, captopril 100 mg, enalapril 20 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg,  or alpha-methyldopa 1000 mg and is achieved without adverse effect on plasma  lipoproteins or carbohydrate metabolism in patients with concomitant diabetes  mellitus. Evidence from prospective studies suggests a greater antihypertensive  efficacy in the elderly than in younger patients. In patients with intermittent  claudication, results have been inconsistent in small studies, while a large  study showed no improvement in pain-free walking distance but fewer amputations  compared to placebo. In Raynaud's phenomenon symptomatic improvement relative to  placebo was achieved in larger trials. Its role in preventing atherosclerotic  complications requires further investigation. Ketanserin is reasonably well  tolerated, the frequency of adverse effects being comparable with that of other  antihypertensive drugs in controlled trials. Dizziness, tiredness, oedema, dry  mouth and weight gain are the most commonly reported effects. Ketanserin prolongs  QT interval in a dose-related manner, and when given in certain predisposing  circumstances ventricular arrhythmias and syncope may occur. Administered  intravenously, ketanserin 10mg followed by an infusion of 2 to 4 mg/h controls  moderate to severe pre- and postoperative hypertension in most patients, acting  as a balanced vasodilator, lowering cardiac pre- and afterload. Although the  arrhythmogenic potential of ketanserin in patients receiving potassium-depleting  diuretics requires suitable precautions, it appears that its antihypertensive  activity is suited to the elderly provided plasma potassium concentrations are  normal at the start of treatment and are maintained within the normal range.","1990-12","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:17:16","","903-949","","6","40","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2079001","","","","Humans; Animals; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Ketanserin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Vascular Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Experiment 1, naive rats, maintained on ad lib  food and water, were given daily 40-min access to a 6% (w/v) alcohol solution and  water. Daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of captopril (20 mg/kg)  significantly reduced alcohol intake, while pretreatment with subcutaneous (SC)  injections of the bradykinin antagonist [D-Phe7]-bradykinin (100-300  micrograms/kg) attenuated the suppressive effect of captopril on alcohol intake.  The saline vehicle or the bradykinin antagonist alone did not alter alcohol  intake. In Experiment 2, bradykinin was administered daily at 100, 200, and 400  micrograms/kg doses SC either alone or in combination with captopril 10 mg/kg IP.  Neither bradykinin nor captopril by themselves changed alcohol or water intake.  Bradykinin combined with captopril stimulated water intake and reduced alcohol  intake by up to 70%. This effect was not due to drug-induced changes in the  pharmacokinetics of alcohol. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist  [Sar1,Thr8]-angiotensin II at 250 and 500 micrograms/kg SC attenuated the  stimulation of water intake but not the reduction in alcohol intake. It is  suggested that by inhibiting kininase II, ACE inhibitors extend the duration of  action of bradykinin and thereby unmask a potent inhibition of alcohol intake  mediated by kinins--an effect that is dissociable from the accompanying  stimulation of water intake. Taken together, these results point to an  involvement of the kinin system in the regulation of alcohol intake and in  particular to a role of bradykinin in the suppressive effect of ACE inhibitors on  alcohol intake.","1993-12","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:49","","751-758","","4","46","","Pharmacol Biochem Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8309951","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Drinking/drug effects; Alcohol Deterrents/*pharmacology; Alcohol Drinking/*psychology; Angiotensin II/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology; Bradykinin/analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology; Captopril/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical pharmacokinetic considerations.","Drugs & aging","","1170-229X","10.2165/00002512-199101030-00004","","The incidence of both systolic and diastolic hypertension is increased in elderly patients, therefore antihypertensive drugs are commonly used in this population.  In addition to changes in blood pressure, the aging process also causes numerous  changes in other physiological parameters, resulting in altered pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic responses to the drugs. The dosage regimens for thiazide  diuretics and amiloride must be individually titrated in the elderly patient,  since the elimination of these agents decreases concurrently with decreased renal  function, as indicated by compromised creatinine clearance. The initial doses of  the calcium antagonists should be decreased in elderly patients, since  representative compounds from all 3 chemically heterogeneous classes have been  shown to have decreased clearance in these patients which appears to be primarily  due to the status of hepatic function in the patient. However, with verapamil,  the dosage should be further decreased in association with compromised renal  function. The dosage of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should  be adjusted according to renal function rather than age. Lisinopril, which is  primarily eliminated unchanged, is usually given in lower doses in the elderly,  and doses of both captopril and enalapril may need to be reduced, depending on  renal function. While there is no need to adjust the dosage regimen for the  alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (prazosin, terazosin), caution should be used  with the beta-adrenergic blockers, particularly the hydrophilic agents, since  they are renally eliminated. Labetalol may be a suitable alternative beta-blocker  for the elderly patient, since its pharmacodynamic properties of decreased  systemic vascular resistance without changes in heart rate or stroke volume are  preferential for the elderly patient, and its pharmacokinetics are relatively  unchanged in this population. Drugs that act primarily through the central  nervous system, such as clonidine, methyldopa and guanfacine, require smaller  doses in the presence of renal dysfunction. In contrast, guanabenz is metabolised  primarily by the liver, so it would appear to be useful in elderly patients with  renal dysfunction despite the lack of studies in this population. Guanadrel, an  adrenergic neuron blocking drug, also requires a dosage reduction in patients  with impaired renal function. In addition to the pharmacokinetic changes that  occur in the elderly patient, pharmacodynamic changes may also be anticipated due  to receptor modifications. Older patients have a decrease in beta-receptor  sensitivity, while alpha-receptor sensitivity does not change. When designing the  dosage regimen for a senior patient with hypertension, the combination of all  these variables must be considered.","1991-05","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:38","","194-211","","3","1","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1686570","","","","Humans; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/*drug therapy/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Diuretics/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An updated review.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-198815020-00002","","Pharmacokinetics is the study of the effect that the body has on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The pharmacokinetics of a specific drug  are assessed by the volume of distribution, bioavailability, clearance and  elimination half-life. Elimination half-life is directly related to the volume of  distribution and inversely related to clearance. Any 1 or more of these  parameters may be altered by physiological changes such as ageing, or disease  states such as congestive heart failure. Congestive heart failure is associated  with hypoperfusion to various organs including the sites of drug clearance, i.e.  the liver and kidneys. It also leads to organ congestion as seen in the liver and  gut. The main changes in drug pharmacokinetics seen in congestive heart failure  are a reduction in the volume of distribution and impairment of clearance. The  change in elimination half-life consequently depends on whether both clearance  and the apparent volume of distribution change, and the extent of that change.  Pharmacokinetic changes are not always predictable in congestive heart failure,  but it seems that the net effect of reduction in the volume of distribution and  impairment of clearance is that plasma concentrations of drugs are usually higher  in patients with congestive heart failure than in healthy subjects. The changes  in pharmacokinetics assume importance only in the case of drugs with a narrow  therapeutic ratio (e.g. digoxin) and some of the antiarrhythmics such as  lignocaine (lidocaine), procainamide and disopyramide. This necessitates  reduction in both the loading and maintenance doses. Prolongation of the  elimination half-life leads to delay in reaching steady-state, and therefore dose  increments must be made more gradually. Plasma concentration measurements of the  drugs concerned are a good guide to therapy and help to avoid toxicity.  Pharmacokinetic changes are of less importance in the case of drugs with  immediate clinical response, e.g. diuretics and intravenous vasodilators such as  nitrates and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The dose in the latter group can be  titrated to the desired effect. Not all adverse reactions to drugs that may occur  in heart failure are the result of alterations in pharmacokinetics; rather, some  may be due to important drug interactions. An interaction may occur directly e.g.  reduction of renal clearance of digoxin by captopril and quinidine; or  indirectly, e.g. through diuretic-induced hypokalaemia, which exacerbate  arrhythmias associated with digoxin and antiarrhythmics such as quinidine and  procainamide.","1988-08","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:52","","94-113","","2","15","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 3064953","","","","Humans; Animals; Heart Failure/*metabolism; Cardiovascular Agents/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering that aspirin,  compared with captopril, reduces renal blood flow and, thus, tubular tracer  delivery in poststenotic kidneys, aspirin renography is expected to be more  useful, particularly if tubular tracers are used. METHODS: We prospectively  compared aspirin renography (20 mg/kg orally) and captopril renography (25 mg  orally) with 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine in 75 consecutive patients suspected  of having RAS. RESULTS: RAS, diagnosed as stenosis of more than 50% on  angiography, was found unilaterally in 34 patients and bilaterally in 17  patients. RAS was absent in 24 patients. The sensitivities for unilateral RAS or  bilateral RAS (i.e., stenosis that was at least unilateral) were, respectively,  88% and 88% for captopril renography and 82% and 94% for aspirin renography (not  significant). The overall specificity was 75% for captopril renography and 83%  for aspirin renography (not significant). Tracer uptake ratios, time to peak  activity, and percentage of 20-min tracer retention were also not significantly  different for captopril and aspirin renography. Subgroup analysis of modest  (50-75%) and severe (> or =75%) RAS, or of plasma creatinine greater than 120  micromol/L, also showed no difference between captopril and aspirin renography.

It has the unique  advantage over other ACE inhibitors in causing a lower incidence of dry cough.  After oral administration, imidapril is rapidly converted in the liver to its  active metabolite imidaprilat. The plasma levels of imidaprilat gradually  increase in proportion to the dose, and decline slowly. The time to reach the  maximum plasma concentration (T(max)) is 2.0 h for imidapril and 9.3 h for  imidaprilat. The elimination half-lives (t(1/2)) of imidapril and imidaprilat is  1.7 and 14.8 h, respectively. Imidapril and its metabolites are excreted chiefly  in the urine. As an ACE inhibitor, imidaprilat is as potent as enalaprilat, an  active metabolite of enalapril, and about twice as potent as captopril. In  patients with hypertension, blood pressure was still decreased at 24 h after  imidapril administration. The antihypertensive effect of imidapril was  dose-dependent. The maximal reduction of blood pressure and plasma ACE was  achieved with imidapril, 10 mg once daily, and the additional effect was not  prominent with higher doses. When administered to patients with AMI, imidapril  improved left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced plasma brain natriuretic  peptide (BNP) levels. In patients with mild-to-moderate CHF [New York Heart  Association (NYHA) functional class II-III], imidapril increased exercise time  and physical working capacity and decreased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide  (ANP) and BNP levels in a dose-related manner. In patients with diabetic  nephropathy, imidapril decreased urinary albumin excretion. Interestingly,  imidapril improved asymptomatic dysphagia in patients with a history of stroke.  In the same patients it increased serum substance P levels, while the angiotensin  II receptor antagonist losartan was ineffective. These studies indicate that  imidapril is a versatile ACE inhibitor. In addition to its effectiveness in the  treatment of hypertension, CHF, and AMI, imidapril has beneficial effects in the  treatment of diabetic nephropathy and asymptomatic dysphagia. Good tissue  penetration and inhibition of tissue ACE by imidapril contributes to its  effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. The  major advantages of imidapril are its activity in the treatment of various  cardiovascular diseases and lower incidence of cough compared with some of the  older ACE inhibitors.","2002","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:18:47","","93-110","","2","20","","Cardiovasc Drug Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12177688","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cardiovascular Diseases/*drug therapy; Cardiomegaly/drug therapy; Hypertension/drug therapy; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Kidney Failure, Chronic/drug therapy; Deglutition Disorders/drug therapy; *Imidazolidines; Imidazoles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Arrhythmias, Cardiac/drug therapy; Myocardial Ischemia/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A look at the future.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199040060-00004","","Available information indicates that about 78 new molecules belonging to the class of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are under investigation,  and that at least 11 or 12 of the newer ACE inhibitors will be available for  clinical use. The newer ACE inhibitors can be classified, according to the zinc  ion ligand of ACE, into 3 main chemical classes: sulfhydryl-, carboxyl- and  phosphoryl-containing ACE inhibitors. All the newer sulfhydryl-containing ACE  inhibitors differ from captopril since they are prodrugs, and among them  alacepril and probably moveltipril (altiopril, MC 838) are converted in vivo to  captopril. When compared with captopril, they show a slower onset and a longer  duration of action, and obviously the same route of elimination. Zofenopril, a  prodrug that is converted in vivo to the active diacid, shows a greater potency,  a similar peak time and a longer duration of action than captopril and, unlike  captopril, partial elimination through the liver. The newer carboxyl-containing  ACE inhibitors are prodrugs which are converted in vivo to active diacids. Like  enalaprilat, they are excreted via the kidney; the exception is spirapril, which  is totally eliminated by the liver. Compared to enalapril, benazepril shows an  earlier peak time and a slightly shorter terminal half-life, cilazapril and  ramipril have an earlier peak time and even longer terminal half-life,  perindopril shows similar peak time and terminal half-life, while delapril,  quinapril and spirapril show an earlier peak time and a shorter half-life. The  phosphoryl-containing ACE inhibitors belong to a new chemical class. Fosinopril  is a prodrug which is converted to the active diacid in vivo, shows a relatively  late peak time, a long terminal half-life, and is eliminated partially by the  liver. SQ 29852, the only newly developed ACE inhibitor which is not a prodrug,  seems to be more effective than captopril, with a much longer lasting effect and  elimination through the kidney. When the differences in potency between these  drugs are compensated by dosage adjustment, all the newer ACE inhibitors are  expected to exert a similar amount of inhibition of circulating ACE, and  therefore to inhibit to a similar extent the generation of circulating  angiotensin II and the breakdown of bradykinin. Obviously they may differ in  timing and the duration of circulating ACE inhibition according to their  pharmacokinetic properties. With regard to the possibility that they may  stimulate prostaglandin synthesis, it is suggested that this action, which does  not seem to be specific to this drug class, plays only a minor role in their  antihypertensive action; the hypothesis that the sulfhydryl group exerts an  additional stimulating action remains to be proved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400  WORDS)","1990-12","2023-10-27 12:54:52","2023-10-27 14:19:51","","800-828","","6","40","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2078997","","","","Humans; Animals; Hypertension/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In rats, dogs, and monkeys with  2-kidney renal hypertension, orally administered captopril rapidly and markedly  reduces blood pressure; this antihypertensive effect apparently occurs via a  renin-dependent mechanism; that is, the inhibition of ACE. In 1-kidney renal  hypertension studies in rats and dogs, it was determined that oral doses of  captopril markedly lowered blood pressure, but only after several days of dosing;  the mechanism is thought to be non-renin dependent. In SHR, daily oral doses of  captopril progressively lowered blood pressure; normal levels were attained by  the sixth month. In all species studied, the reduction in blood pressure resulted  from a reduction in total peripheral resistance; cardiac output remained  unchanged or increased. In humans, captopril reduces blood pressure in patients  with essential hypertension with low, normal, and high renin levels, and in  patients with renovascular hypertension and hypertension associated with chronic  renal failure. In hypertensive patients with high plasma renin activity,  captopril apparently exerts most of its pharmacologic effects through inhibition  of ACE. The means by which captopril reduces high blood pressure associated with  low or normal PRA is not known, but it is clear that captopril does not act on an  overactive plasma renin-angiotensin system in these cases. The antihypertensive  effect of captopril is enhanced when it is given in combination with a diuretic  or after salt depletion. Captopril was rapidly and well absorbed in all species  tested, including man. Studies in rodents indicated that ingestion of food caused  a reduction in the extent of absorption and bioavailability of captopril.  Captopril and/or its metabolites were distributed extensively and rapidly  throughout most tissues of normal rats; no radioactivity was detected in the  brain. In vitro and in vivo, captopril formed disulfide bonds with albumin and  other proteins. This binding was reversible in nature. In vitro studies in blood  indicates that the disulfide dimer of captopril and mixed disulfides of captopril  with L-cysteine and glutathione were formed. In intact blood cells, captopril  remained in the reduced form (sulfhydryl), whereas in whole blood or plasma,  captopril was converted to its disulfide dimer and other oxidative products.

In patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, titrated low  doses of captopril used alone or in conjunction with a diuretic are similar in  efficacy to usual doses of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or  beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, as well as to the other ACE inhibitors. In  addition, captopril improved well-being to a greater extent than methyldopa or  propranolol in a study designed specifically to determine the effect of treatment  on the quality of life of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension.  The earlier demonstrated efficacy of captopril, used with a diuretic and often  also with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, in the treatment of severe  hypertension refractory to conventional 'triple therapy' has been confirmed in  more recent trials which illustrate the generally marked antihypertensive effect  of captopril-containing regimens in such patients. Results of initial trials in  patients with scleroderma are promising, with control of hypertension and  stabilization of renal function in these patients when treated at an early stage  of the disease. Several comparative and long term trials of captopril in patients  with chronic congestive heart failure refractory to treatment with a  diuretic/digitalis regimen clearly demonstrate that initial haemodynamic  improvement is maintained and correlates with clinical benefit. A tendency for  overall clinical response to captopril to be better than the response to  prazosin, hydralazine, nisoldipine or enalapril has been reported. Results of a  multicentre comparison with digoxin and placebo indicate that captopril is a  suitable alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate heart failure  who are receiving maintenance diuretic therapy. The tolerability of captopril has  now been studied in many thousands of patients involved in formalized trials and  the early impression of poor tolerability can no longer be justified. The use of  generally lower dosages of captopril in patients with normal or slightly impaired  renal function has resulted in a generally low incidence of rash (0.5 to 4%),  dysgeusia (0.1 to 3%), proteinuria (0.5%), neutropenia (0.3% during first 3  months) and symptomatic hypotension (0.1 to 3%).

The results demonstrate that the spontaneous oxidation of  captopril, enalapril and lisinopril followed first-order degradation kinetics in  McIlvaine's citrate-phosphate buffer. The degradation rates for enalapril and  lisinopril were much slower than that for captopril. With the former two ACE  inhibitors, the first-order rate constants of breakdown in the presence of dermal  homogenate were not significantly different from the control values. Intestinal  homogenate increased the decomposition of both of these inhibitors when compared  to the enzyme-free control systems. On the other hand, the first-order rates of  disappearance of captopril in the presence of both dermal and intestinal  homogenates were lower than in the enzyme-free system. The extent of reduction  was proportional to the amount of homogenate added. This suggests that tissue  homogenates prevent the oxidation of captopril to its disulphide dimer. Transport  experiments show that the amounts of ACE inhibitors transferred from solution on  the mucosal side increased linearly with incubation time over the 2 hr of study.  The rates of transfer from the mucosal side to the serosal side had the following  rank order: captopril > enalapril > lisinopril roughly in the ratio 1:1.13:1.27.  Addition of harmaline caused a significant reduction in the transfer rate of  captopril compared to the control system, which strongly suggests that captopril  is transported by a sodium-dependent carrier-mediated process across intestinal  tissue.","1994-03-29","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1121-1126","","7","47","","Biochem Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8161340","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Wistar; Biological Transport, Active; Drug Stability; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; *Intestinal Absorption; Captopril/*metabolism; Enalapril/*metabolism; Lisinopril/*metabolism; Skin/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under such circumstances photo- and biodegradation in the environment can occur.  However, these processes do not necessarily end up with the complete  mineralization of a chemical. Therefore, the biodegradability of photoproduct(s)  by environmental bacteria is of interest. Cardiovascular diseases are the number  one cause of death globally. Captopril (CP) is used in this study as it is widely  used in Egypt and stated as one of the essential drugs in Egypt for hypertension.  Three tests from the OECD series were used for biodegradation testing: Closed  Bottle test (CBT; OECD 301 D), Manometric Respirometry test (MRT; OECD 301 F) and  the modified Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT; OECD 302 B). Photodegradation (150 W  medium-pressure Hg-lamp) of CP was studied. Also CBT was performed for captopril  disulfide (CPDS) and samples received after 64 min and 512 min of photolysis. The  primary elimination of CP and CPDS was monitored by LC-UV at 210 nm and  structures of photoproducts were assessed by LC-UV-MS/MS (ion trap). Analysis of  photodegradation samples by LC-MS/MS revealed CP sulfonic acid as the major  photodegradation product of CP. No biodegradation was observed for CP, CPDS and  of the mixture resulting from photo-treatment after 64 min in CBT. Partial  biodegradation in the CBT and MRT was observed in samples taken after 512 min  photolysis and for CP itself in MRT.

METHODS: A prospective,  head-to-head study was conducted between Feb 2008 and Dec 2008. One hundred and  fourteen patients enrolled and received captopril to aid in the diagnosis of PA  in the TAIPAI intervention. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were diagnosed with PA.  Post-captopril ARC was significantly correlated with PRA. The area under the  receiver operating characteristic curve of the post-captopril ARR was not  different in PRA vs ARC measurements. When post-captopril ARC-based ARR  (ARR(ARC))>35.5 as the cut-off value, we obtained sensitivity of 75.0% and  specificity of 86.4% to differentiate PA from essential hypertension.  CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of individual PRA and ARC after administration of  captopril was excellent; especially at the lower PRA levels. Post-captopril  ARR(ARC) values used to diagnose PA are not different from post-captopril  PRA-based (ARR(PRA)) values in patients without kidney, liver and heart failures.

Captopril absorption was determined at two initial  intraluminal concentrations in acute (untreated) rats and in rats that had been  chronically treated with captopril. Salicylic acid absorption was determined at  one concentration in acute rats. During the 40-min experimental period, captopril  absorption at the 4.6 mM dose from the gastric pouch was 17.0 +/- 1.8% and 17.9  +/- 5.4% in acute and chronically treated rats, respectively, and 33.6 +/- 9.2%  and 23.7 +/- 7.6%, respectively, from the intestinal loop.

As similar  fractions of the different administered doses were absorbed from the respective  gastric and intestinal sites in both acutely and chronically treated rats, the  absorption process of captopril appears to be principally by passive diffusion  and unaffected by chronic administration of captopril.

Drug doses were titrated. Compared with baseline values, maximal  haemodynamic and humoral effects after the first dose of both angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors were similar, but the effects of ramipril (5 mg)  demonstrated a slower onset of action and a significantly longer duration than  captopril (12.5 mg). After 3 months of treatment a single dose of 5 mg ramipril  showed the same 24-hour haemodynamic profile as after the first dose, but the  hypotensive effect was less marked. There was no plasma accumulation of  ramiprilat. Serum creatinine and potassium remained stable, except for one  patient whose renal function deteriorated on captopril treatment. Complex  ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 11 patients and were unaffected after  treatment with ramipril or captopril. Two patients died suddenly during ramipril  therapy and one patient during captopril therapy. In summary, ramipril is an  effective, long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, producing  long-term haemodynamic effects in patients with congestive heart failure.

Animals were exposed to 100 ppm arsenite as sodium arsenite in drinking water for  six weeks followed by treatment with DMSA (50 mg/kg, orally), captopril (50  mg/kg, intraperitoneally) either alone or in combination, once daily for 5  consecutive days. Arsenite exposure led to a significant depletion of blood  delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity, glutathione and platelet  levels while significantly increased the level of reactive oxygen species (in  RBCs). Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) level showed a significant decrease  while, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels increased on  arsenite exposure indicating arsenite induced hepatic oxidative stress. Kidney  GSH, GSSG, catalase and TBARS remained unchanged on arsenite exposure. Treatment  with DMSA was effective in increasing ALAD activity while, captopril was  ineffective when given alone. Captopril when co-administered with DMSA also  provided no additional beneficial effect on blood ALAD activity but significant  brought altered platelet counts back to the normal value. In contrast,  administration of captopril alone provided significant beneficial effects on  hepatic oxidative stress, and in combination with DMSA provided a more pronounced  recovery in the TBARS level compared to the individual effect of DMSA and  captopril. Renal biochemical variables remained insensitive to arsenite and any  of the treatments. Interestingly, combined administration of captopril with DMSA  had a remarkable effect in depleting total arsenic concentration from blood and  soft tissues. These results lead us to conclude that captopril administration  during chelation treatment had some beneficial effects particularly on the  protection of inhibited blood ALAD activity, and depletion of arsenic level. The  study supports our earlier conclusion that a co-administration of an antioxidant  is more beneficial than monotherapy with the chelating agents, in order to  achieve optimal effects of chelation in arsenite toxicity.","2007-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","372-379","","4","144","","Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17188940","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Drug Interactions; Oxidative Stress; Rats, Wistar; Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Brain/metabolism; Antioxidants/*pharmacology; Kidney/drug effects/metabolism; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Glutathione Disulfide/metabolism; Captopril/*pharmacology; Zinc/metabolism; Antidotes/*pharmacology; Arsenic/blood/metabolism; Arsenites/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; Copper/metabolism; Glutathione/blood/metabolism; Porphobilinogen Synthase/blood; Succimer/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prepared tablets showed no floating lag time and prolong total  floating time (>24 h). Drug release was found dependent upon porosity of tablets,  an increase in porosity of tablets resulted in increased drug release, so it can  be tuned by varying concentration of l-menthol. In addition to floating and  sustained release properties, porous tablets showed robust mechanical behavior in  wet conditions, which can enable them to withstand real gastric environment  stress. In vivo studies using New Zealand rabbits also confirmed the prolonged  gastric retention (24 h) and plasma drug concentration-time profile showed  sustained release of captopril with higher T(max) and MRT as compared to marketed  immediate-release tablets.

This study investigated the prophylactic and protective effects of  pomegranate juice (PJ) on the kidney exposed to nephrotoxicity induced by these  medications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar male rats received drinking water  (groups 1 to 3) or PJ at doses of 4 mL/kg (group 4), 10 mL/kg (groups 5 and 7),  and 15 mL/kg (group 6) for 14 days. Captopril and gentamicin were administrated  on days 10 and 14 to groups 1 and 2, respectively, while groups 3 to 6 received  both. Group 7 did not receive anything. The serum, urine, and renal tissue  parameters were measured after the experiment. RESULTS: Group 1 (captopril) had a  higher malondialdehyde level than groups 4, 5, 6, and 7 with PJ (P <0.05), and  group 3 (captopril and gentamicin) showed the most significant malondialdehyde  level compared to other groups (P < .001).

The instability of the renal index was observed during the  experiment for the groups receiving drinking water, while no significant changes  were observed in the groups receiving PJ. CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic  consumption of PJ for 14 days could show nephroprotective effects by reducing  oxidative stress and potassium depletion.

A surfactant coated carrier method was utilized to formulate  proniosomal powder containing captopril as a model drug. This system was  evaluated in vitro for drug loading, vesicle size, angle of repose, encapsulation  efficiency, and stability studies. This method of proniosome loading resulted in  54.16-70.10% of encapsulation. This study examined critical parameters such as  type and composition of surfactant. Proniosomes were investigated by transmission  electron microscopy for characterization. Four week stability data for  proniosomal powder is reported, and at all sampling points significantly higher  drug retention was observed.

These  findings suggested that siRNA/CP/GNP complexes could be an ideal system for  simultaneous transfer of drug and siRNA, which might be a new promising strategy  for effective breast cancer therapy.","2015","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","813-827","","13","26","","J Biomater Sci Polym Ed","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26166244","","","","Female; Animals; Gene Silencing; Cell Line, Tumor; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Cell Survival/drug effects; Mice, Nude; siRNA; Neoplasm Transplantation; Tumor Burden; anti-angiogenesis; RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage; breast cancer; captopril; Captopril/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; *Drug Carriers/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; *Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry; Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Gold Compounds/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; gold nanoparticles; Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology/*therapy; Polyethyleneimine/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; RNAi Therapeutics/*methods; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Apomorphine-induced behaviour was observed, and recorded using a  keypad linked to a microcomputer. In agreement with previous findings, low doses  of apomorphine induced a syndrome of vacuous mouth movements, penile grooming,  yawning and immobility whereas at higher doses the yawning syndrome disappeared  to be replaced with sniffing, licking and gnawing. Two antagonism studies were  carried out. In the first the effects of captopril on apomorphine-induced  behaviour were compared with those of the classical neuroleptic haloperidol, and  in the second dose-response curves for the effects of captopril and enalapril on  apomorphine-induced behaviour were determined. Captopril had no effect on the  apomorphine-induced yawning syndrome whereas this was blocked by haloperidol. In  contrast, both captopril and haloperidol blocked oral stereotypy (licking and  gnawing) induced by apomorphine but had no effect on sniffing induced by the  dopamine agonist. Selective blockade of apomorphine-induced oral stereotypy by  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition was confirmed in the second study in  which both captopril and enalapril were observed to antagonize  apomorphine-induced gnawing. The inhibition of apomorphine-induced gnawing by  enalapril correlated with inhibition of brain angiotensin converting enzyme, but  not lung angiotensin converting enzyme, by the drug as assessed by ex vivo  penetration studies. These data suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibition modulates the expression of apomorphine-induced oral stereotypy, a  response that is thought to be mediated by postsynaptic dopamine  receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1994-02","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","799-805","","4","58","","Neuroscience","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8190257","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Captopril/*pharmacology; Stereotyped Behavior/*drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Apomorphine/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology; Haloperidol; Lung/drug effects; Neostriatum/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its cytotoxicity is due to inhibition of the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A,  resulting in hyperphosphorylation of a number of functional and cytoskeletal  proteins. To penetrate through the plasma membrane, MC-LR needs specific  transporters such the organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) that are  highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Hence, our goal was to investigate the role  of the membrane transport proteins for the cytotoxic effect of MC-LR on adhesive  cell lines different from hepatocytes. We have used three cell lines--A549 (human  lung carcinoma), SK-Hep-1 (human liver adenocarcinoma), FL (human amniotic normal  cells), and two inhibitors of the OATP (cyclosporine A and captopril). To examine  the cytotoxic effect of MC-LR we applied MTT and Neutral Red assays. In addition,  a fluorescent staining of the mitochondria by JC-1 was performed. A  dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed for the three cell lines, as this  effect was most pronounced in A549. No cytotoxicity was detected when the  captopril was added 2 h before treatment of the cells with MC-LR. Addition of  captopril to the cells 2 h after treatment with MC-LR leads to enhancement of the  cytotoxic effect. Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential after treatment with  MC-LR was detected in the three cell lines, compared to untreated control cells.  Results from the NR-cytotoxicity assay indicated that MC-LR does not affect the  lysosomes. Captopril is an effective inhibitor of both OATP influx membrane  transport proteins and the P-gp efflux pumps involved in the transport of MC-LR.  It protects the cells from toxic effects of the cyanotoxin MC-LR.","2016-03-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","50-57","","","111","","Toxicon","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filaments were used as the exci-pient to prepare  the shell of tablet. The ellipse-shaped tablets (the length of major axes of  ellipse was 20 mm, the length of the minor axes of ellipse was 10 mm, the height  of tablet was 5 mm) with two separate compartments were designed and printed  using FDM 3D printer. The height of layer was 0.2 mm, and the thickness of roof  or floor was 0.6 mm. The thickness of shell was 1.2 mm, and the thickness of the  partition wall between the two compartments was 0.6 mm. Two cardiovascular drugs,  captopril (CTP) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), were selected as model drugs for  the printed compound tablet and filled in the two compartments of the tablet,  respectively. The microscopic morphology of the tablets was observed by scanning  electron microscopy (SEM). The weight variation of the tablets was investigated  by electronic scale. The hardness of the tablets was measured by a single-column  mechanical test system. The contents of the drugs in the tablets were determined  by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the dissolution apparatus  was used to measure the in vitro drug release of the tablets. RESULTS: The  prepared FDM 3D printed compound tablets were all in good shape without printing  defects. The average weight of the tablets was (644.3±6.55) mg. The content of  CTP and HCT was separately (52.3±0.26) mg and (49.6±0.74) mg.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After a single-blind,  4-week, placebo run-in phase, 527 patients (mean +/- SD age 54.5 +/- 1.2 years)  with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 101.2-101.7 mmHg were randomly assigned  to one of the three treatments for 8 weeks. The main evaluation criteria were  diastolic blood pressure and serum potassium concentration. Equivalence was  assessed on an intention-to-treat basis, using Schuirmann's method, which  involves performing two one-tailed statistical tests on the data. Thirty-five  patients were withdrawn from the study but there were no differences between  groups in the reasons for withdrawal. RESULTS: Diastolic blood pressure decreased  by between 13.1 and 14.2 mmHg in the three groups. The 90% confidence intervals  for the differences between perindopril + indapamide and the other treatments  were -1.1, +1.7 mmHg for captopril + hydrochlorothiazide and -0.4, +2.6 mmHg for  enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide.

The developed approach was linear over concentration ranges of 0.5-130.0,  50.0-4,500.0 and 0.3-30.0 ng/ml for nifedipine, captopril and bisoprolol,  respectively. The method revealed a sufficient lower limit of quantification in  the range of 0.3-50.0 ng/ml, as well as high recovery percentages, indicating  high bioanalytical applicability. The proposed method was efficiently applied to  a pharmacokinetic evaluation of a fixed-dose combination of the analytes in  healthy male volunteers.","2023-09","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","e5664","","9","37","","Biomed Chromatogr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37114598","","","","Humans; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Nifedipine; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods; LC-MS/MS; Chromatography, Liquid/methods; human plasma; pharmacokinetic study; captopril; *Captopril; *Bisoprolol; bisoprolol; nifedipine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicated that  captopril is very permeable in the small intestine but not in the colon, and the  permeability in the small intestine is both pH and concentration dependent. The  estimated parameters for the carrier are: Km*, 6 mM; Jmax*, 12 mM; and Pc*, 2.  There is also a significant passive component to captopril absorption in the  small intestine. Furthermore, the intestinal permeability of captopril was  significantly decreased by the withdrawal of sodium from the perfusate (3 times),  and the addition of 85 mM of gly-gly (2.5 times), 15 mM of gly-pro (4 times),  dipeptide mixture (4.5 times), 0.5 mM of 2,4-dinitrophenol (4 times), and 10 mM  of cephradine (6 times). This is the first demonstration that an angiotensin  converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is at least in part transported by a  carrier-mediated process in the intestine via the peptide carrier system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Donut-shaped tablet were made of different ratios of diluents to polymer or  combination of polymers by direct compression method. Top and bottom portions of  the tablet were coated with water-insoluble polymer followed by mucoadhesive  coating. Time of water penetration, measurement of tensile strength, mucoadhesion  studies (static ex vivo and ex vivo wash-off) were taken into account for  characterization of respective films. In vitro study has been performed at  different dissolution mediums. Optimized batches were also prepared by wet  granulation. Stability studies of optimized batches have been performed. RESULTS:  The results of time of water penetration and tensile strength indicated positive  response against water impermeation. Mucoadhesive studies showed that film  thickness of 0.12 mm was good for retention of tablet at stomach. At pH 1.2,  optimized batch of tablet made with hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) E15 as  binder showed 80% w/w drug release within 4–5 h with maximum average release of  97.49% w/w. Similarly, maximum average releases of 96.36% w/w and 95.47% w/w were  obtained with nearly same dissolution patterns using combination of HPMC E5 and  HPMC E50 and sodium salt of carboxy methyl cellulose (NaCMC) 500–600 cPs instead  of HPMC E15.

R.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a comparative review.","DICP : the annals of pharmacotherapy","","1042-9611","10.1177/106002809002400512","","The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and dosages of the three currently available angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are  reviewed. This class of agents effectively inhibits the conversion of angiotensin  I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, a hormone that also promotes, via  aldosterone stimulation, increased sodium and water retention. The ACE  inhibitors, therefore, are capable of lowering blood pressure primarily by  promoting vasodilatation and reducing intravascular fluid volume. Captopril, the  first orally active, commercially available ACE inhibitor, is a  sulfhydryl-containing compound. Captopril was followed by the introduction of  enalapril and lisinopril, two non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitors. The pharmacokinetic  profiles of these three ACE inhibitors differ. Captopril has rapid onset with  relatively short duration of action, whereas enalapril and lisinopril have slower  onset and relatively long duration of action. Captopril is an active ACE  inhibitor in its orally absorbable parent form. In contrast, enalapril must be  deesterified in the liver to the metabolite enalaprilat in order to inhibit the  converting enzyme; this accounts for its delayed onset of action. Lisinopril does  not require metabolic activation to be effective; however, a slow and incomplete  absorption pattern explains the delay in onset of activity. Captopril and its  disulfide metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine with minor elimination  in the feces. Approximately two-thirds of an administered enalapril dose is  excreted in the urine as both the parent drug and the metabolite enalaprilat; the  remainder of these two substances are excreted in the feces. Lisinopril does not  undergo measurable metabolism and approximately one-third is excreted unchanged  in the urine with the remaining parent drug being excreted in the feces. The ACE  inhibitors lower systemic vascular resistance with a resultant decrease in blood  pressure. Their efficacy is comparable to diuretics and beta-blockers in treating  patients with mild, moderate, or severe essential and renovascular hypertension.  In those patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) the ACE inhibitors  produce a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary  capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure. These drugs may produce  improvement in cardiac output and stroke volume and, with chronic administration,  may promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The antihypertensive  effects of the ACE inhibitors are enhanced when these agents are combined with a  diuretic. Captopril and enalapril have been shown to be of particular benefits as  adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure, both in terms of  subjective improvement of patient symptoms, and in improving overall hemodynamic  status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-05","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","506-525","","5","24","","DICP","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2188439","","","","Humans; Animals; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thiol reductants (25 mM) were, however, partially able to reduce  penicillamine disulfide with the most effective agent being glutathione (15%  reduction) following by dithioerythritol (8%) and cysteine (5.1%). The reduction  of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide by glutathione was 6-fold higher than for  penicillamine disulfide. Kinetic analysis showed that the initial rate of  reduction and equilibrium constant for the reduction of penicillamine disulfides  by glutathione were 267- and 875-fold less than for captopril disulfide at pH  7.4. Biotransformation studies in the cytosol fraction of rat blood cells  demonstrated that whereas 48% of the reduction of captopril disulfide was  enzyme-mediated only 19% of the penicillamine formed was enzyme-mediated for  penicillamine disulfide.

The internal standard (IS) was  5-methoxy-1H-benzimidazole-2-thiol. Derivatization with monobromobimane  immediately after blood collection and plasma preparation prevents oxidation of  captopril to the corresponding disulfide compound and enhances the ionization  yield. Consequently, derivatization enhances sample stability and detection  sensitivity. Addition of the internal standard was made immediately after plasma  preparation. The internal standard was also derivatized by monobromobimane, as it  contains a thiol functional group. Preparation of plasma samples containing  captopril and IS derivatives was based upon protein precipitation through  addition of acetonitrile, in a volumetric ratio 1:2. The reversed-phase liquid  chromatographic separation was achieved on a rapid resolution cartridge Zorbax  SB-C(18), monitored through positive electrospray ionization and tandem MS  detection using the multiple-reaction monitoring mode.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review were to examine the evidence of  effectiveness and safety of hibiscus in the treatment of hypertension. METHODS:  We searched several medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials, and the specialized register of the Cochrane  Hypertension Group and the general engine Google) to January 2009. We included  randomized controlled trials that had examined Hibiscus's effectiveness and  safety in the treatment of primary hypertension in adults. Two authors  independently selected the trials for the review, extracted the data, and  critically appraised the included studies. RESULTS: Four trials, with a total of  390 patients, met our inclusion criteria. Two studies compared Hibiscus  sabdariffa to black tea; one study compared it to captopril and one to  lisinopril. The studies found that Hibiscus had greater blood pressure reduction  than tea but less than the ACE-inhibitors. However, all studies, except one, were  short term and of poor quality with a Jadad scoring of <3 and did not meet  international standards. CONCLUSION: The four randomized controlled studies  identified in this review do not provide reliable evidence to support  recommending Hibiscus sabdariffa for the treatment of primary hypertension in  adults.","2010-02","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","83-86","","2","17","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

The goal of this article is to review  the current status of IDRs, potential mechanisms and the challenges associated  with predicting drug toxicity. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the metabolic  pathways of five select classes of sulfur-containing drugs (captopril,  troglitazone, tienilic acid, zileuton, methimazole and sudoxicam) suggesting that  bioactivation plays a crucial role in the occurrence of IDRs. The reader will  gain further awareness that the sulfur atom can propagate as the bioactivation  site for the formation of reactive and conceivably toxic metabolites. As such, it  is the body's capacity to detoxify these drug products that may determine whether  IDRs occur. EXPERT OPINION: Incomplete understanding of mechanisms culminating in  IDR occurrence represents a monumental impediment toward their abrogation.  Moreover, current technology utilized to predict their manifestation (including  structure-toxicity relationships) is not infallible and thus, development of  novel tools and strategies is indispensible. In an attempt to streamline clinical  development and drug approval processes, consortiums have been instated under the  US FDA Critical Path Initiative. Collectively, these parameters along with the  availability of validated biomarkers and new/updated regulatory guidance could  positively influence the outcome of drug toxicity profiles and direct future drug  development.","2012-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","467-485","","4","8","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22394356","","","","Humans; Biomarkers; Animals; Pharmacokinetics; Structure-Activity Relationship; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Pharmaceutical Preparations/metabolism; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Biotransformation/physiology; Sulfur Compounds/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was found to be an effective, non-toxic  antihypertensive agent as well as an afterload-reducing agent for patients with  congestive heart failure (CHF). The primary activity of teprotide resulted from  blockade of the angiotensin I converting enzyme--the pivotal step in the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and consequent reductions in  angiotensin II levels. There was limited clinical testing for teprotide because  of: its scarcity; the need for parenteral administration; and the subsequent  discovery and synthesis of captopril, the first orally active angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitor. Captopril is the prototype oral angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitor and has been extensively studied since the initiation  of formal studies in 1976. Perhaps one of the most closely researched drugs in  modern times, the experience with captopril now includes more than 12,000  patients studied in formalized trials and over 4,000,000 patients treated  world-wide by physicians for hypertension and congestive heart failure. Enalapril  (MK421) is the first of what appears to be a growing number of analogues which  are structurally and pharmacodynamically different from captopril; yet, they  possess the same capacity for inhibiting the activity of angiotensin converting  enzyme. The side effect profile of enalapril (and presumably future) angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors appears to be similar to captopril, though clearly  more experience is needed with newer agents. The initial use of captopril was  troubled by a relatively high incidence of side effects which will form the focus  of this discussion. Partially the result of incomplete pharmacokinetic  information, captopril was administered in early studies at dosages now  recognised to be far in excess of those necessary for drug action. In addition,  dosages were given without regard for deficiencies of renal function, now known  to be the main excretory route of captopril. The population of those patients  studied frequently had chronic, treatment-resistant hypertension, often  associated with concomitant end-organ disease (especially renal disease); and  many additional factors further complicating the clinical setting, e.g. a  relatively high incidence of collagen vascular disease and immunosuppressive  treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1986-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","122-141","","2","1","","Med Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3023783","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Child; Pregnancy; Kidney Diseases/chemically induced; Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Drug Eruptions/etiology; Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced; Neutropenia/chemically induced; Hypotension/chemically induced; Captopril/*adverse effects; Respiratory Tract Diseases/chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major hydrolysis products during the initial  5-min incubation were YGGFLR and Y, which indicates that dipeptidyl  carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase activities were mainly involved in the  hydrolysis. After 60 min of incubation, dyn-(1-8) was completely hydrolyzed in  both membrane preparations. When the ileal and the striatal preparations were  incubated for 60 min in the presence of both captopril, a dipeptidyl  carboxypeptidase inhibitor, and amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, 63.8 and  49.3% of dyn-(1-8), respectively, were hydrolyzed. The YGG fragment was the major  hydrolysis product in both preparations. When the ileal and the striatal membrane  fractions were incubated with dyn-(1-8) in the presence of three peptidase  inhibitors, captopril, amastatin and phosphoramidon (an inhibitor of  endopeptidase-24.11), approximately 95% of the opioid octapeptide remained intact  in both cases. This shows that dyn-(1-8) was almost exclusively hydrolyzed by  three enzymes, amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, captopril-sensitive dipeptidyl  carboxypeptidase I and phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase-24.11, in both  ileal and striatal membranes. Additionally, the Ke (equilibrium dissociation  constant) values of selective antagonists against dyn-(1-8) and its initial main  hydrolysis product YGGFLR in two isolated preparations pretreated with the three  peptidase inhibitors indicate that the latter acts on mu receptors in guinea pig  ileum but delta receptors in mouse vas deferens and the former acts on kappa  receptors in both preparations. It is indicated, therefore, that in the absence  of peptidase inhibitors endogenously released dyn-(1-8) acts either through  dyn-(1-8) itself on kappa receptors or through YGGFLR on mu or delta receptors  depending on both the three peptidase activities and the three receptor type  densities at the target synaptic membrane.","1998-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","863-869","","2","286","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9694943","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Mice; Biotransformation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Hydrolysis; Guinea Pigs; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology; Mice, Inbred ICR; Electrochemistry; Captopril/*pharmacology; *Peptides; Dynorphins/*metabolism; Glycopeptides/*pharmacology; Hypothalamic Hormones/*metabolism; Membranes/drug effects/metabolism; Peptide Fragments/*metabolism; Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, delta/antagonists & inhibitors; Receptors, Opioid, kappa/antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  co-morbid state is believed to act synergistically on accelerating the long-term  diabetic complications. Therefore, adequate treatment of high blood pressure is  essential for diabetic patients, and should be always directed to their benefits.  Albumin glycation is still the most important explanation for the pathogenesis of  chronic diabetic complications. Our in vitro experiments induce non-enzymatic  glycation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) under physiological conditions. The  levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were measured by their  characteristic intrinsic fluorescence. Additions of captopril at concentrations  from 5 to 50 microM caused 10-47% reduction in the formation of AGEs. Captopril  binding properties of native and glycosylated BSA were characterized, and its  affinity towards the native albumin was unaltered by the in vitro glycation.  Therefore, we concluded that captopril could protect against albumin glycation,  and it has a similar binding affinities towards native and glcosylated protein.  Anti-glycation effect may help to attenuate the serious long-term diabetes  related complications. Besides, the unchanged pharmacokinetic parameters provide  an essential extra beneficial effect for diabetic hypertensive patients.","2006-05-03","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","571-575","","2","41","","J Pharm Biomed Anal","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16469467","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Hypertension/drug therapy/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Serum Albumin/chemistry/*metabolism; Glycated Serum Albumin; Captopril/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Diabetes Mellitus/drug therapy/*metabolism; Glycation End Products, Advanced/chemistry/metabolism; Glycosylation/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplement","","0803-8023","10.1080/080370598438447-1","","Management strategies in hypertension evolve in response to an increased understanding of underlying pathophysiological processes and developments and  refinements in drug treatments. Recent research has identified the regulatory  role of the imidazoline (I1) receptor in sympathetic outflow and blood pressure  regulation and this has led to the development of moxonidine, a highly selective  centrally acting antihypertensive agent. At a practical level, moxonidine is  suitable for single daily dosing in hypertension. Furthermore, in comparative  studies moxonidine has a low incidence of symptomatic adverse effects comparable,  for example, to that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, captopril and enalapril. The  antihypertensive efficacy of moxonidine has now been established in a series of  comparative clinical trials against all other first-line antihypertensive drug  classes but, in line with current concepts, it may be necessary to look beyond  blood pressure reduction. For example, centrally acting agents are known to be  effective for promoting the regression of LV hypertrophy and studies in  hypertensive patients have shown that antihypertensive treatment with moxonidine  successfully leads to significant reductions in LV mass indices. Furthermore,  there is now evidence that moxonidine has a beneficial effect on insulin  sensitivity such that there are likely to be improvements in the overall  metabolic profile.

As with amrinone, the relative importance of these properties to  treatment of congestive heart failure still remain controversial. The mode of  action of milrinone appears to be due in part to selective inhibition of a  specific cardiac phosphodiesterase with a subsequent increase in intracellular  cyclic adenosine monophosphate and alteration in intracellular and extracellular  calcium transport. Clinical experience has involved both short and long term  treatment of a limited number of patients with moderate to severe congestive  heart failure refractory to conventional therapy. Milrinone has usually been  administered as intravenous bolus doses (12.5 to 75 micrograms/kg) and/or  continuous intravenous infusion (0.5 microgram/kg/min), or orally (30 to 40  mg/day in divided doses). Milrinone rapidly improves cardiac performance by  enhancing myocardial contractility, and by decreasing systemic vascular  resistance (afterload), left ventricular filling pressure (preload), and  pulmonary arterial pressure. Exercise performance improvement occurs with  enhancement of left ventricular performance but without a significant increase in  myocardial oxygen consumption or significant decrease in mean arterial pressure.  Milrinone has been compared with dobutamine, nitroprusside and captopril in  preliminary short term studies in patients with severe congestive heart failure.  Milrinone significantly increased stroke work index and decreased left  ventricular filling pressure compared to nitroprusside. When compared with  dobutamine, both drugs improved cardiac index (to a similar degree), but  milrinone significantly reduced right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge  pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. One small study suggests  that short term effects of intravenous milrinone may be superior to those of oral  captopril, and it appears that the addition of captopril to milrinone therapy may  produce a synergistic haemodynamic effect. Preliminary long term studies suggest  that tolerance to the haemodynamic effects of milrinone does not occur, and that  the drug is well tolerated and without the thrombocytopenic effects, fever and  gastrointestinal complications observed with amrinone. However, it has not been  demonstrated that milrinone improves the prognosis of the disease or the overall  mortality and its propensity to produce arrhythmias has not been fully agreed  upon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1988-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","158-192","","2","36","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3053125","","","","Humans; Animals; Half-Life; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Milrinone; *Cardiotonic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Pyridones/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An update.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199018030-00003","","Since a previous review by Hurwitz was published in 1977 a large number of reports on drug interactions with antacids have appeared, few of which are of  clinical relevance. Tetracyclines form insoluble complex molecules by metal ion  chelation with various antacids; tetracycline absorption may be decreased by more  than 90% by this interaction. Of the new class of quinolone antibiotics, the  absorption of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin is reduced by 50 to 90% in the presence  of aluminium- and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids. In contrast to early  work showing inhibition of the absorption of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs by  antacids, subsequent studies did not confirm a reduction in the bioavailability  of either atenolol or propranolol during antacid treatment; indeed, they showed  an increase in the plasma concentrations of metoprolol when the drug was  coadministered with an antacid. The bioavailability of captopril was  significantly reduced in the presence of an antacid, and lower plasma  concentrations of this angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were accompanied  by a reduction of its effect on the systolic blood pressure of the patients. The  absorption of the cardiac glycosides digoxin and digitoxin is not inhibited by  antacids to a significant degree, although earlier studies had shown a positive  effect when the dissolution of the glycoside preparations was relatively poor.  Antacids reduce the bioavailability of the H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine and  ranitidine only when high antacid doses are used and when the drugs are  administered simultaneously. The bioavailability of famotidine was not  significantly altered by a potent antacid preparation, although a trend towards  reduced absorption was observed. Iron absorption is significantly decreased in  the presence of sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, but is nearly complete  when coadministered with aluminium-magnesium hydroxide. Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, tenoxicam, ketoprofen, ibuprofen and  piroxicam are not affected in their absorption by antacid treatment. Theophylline  bioavailability is unchanged when the drug is given together with antacids,  although its rate of absorption may be altered, leading to a reduction or an  increase in the time of the occurrence of peak plasma drug concentrations.","1990-03","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","210-219","","3","18","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 1969784","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Biological Availability; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Iron/pharmacokinetics; Antacids/*pharmacology; Anti-Bacterial Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Histamine H2 Antagonists/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scope of therapeutic use of the drug has been  expanded and become better defined since it was first reviewed in the Journal in  1979. Atenolol is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with all  grades of hypertension. Data from comparative studies show that when administered  orally, atenolol reduces blood pressure to a similar extent, and in a similar  proportion of patients, as usual therapeutic doses of other beta-adrenoceptor  antagonists (such as acebutolol, celiprolol, betaxolol, indenolol, metoprolol,  nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, tertatolol), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril and lisinopril), calcium antagonists (e.g.  amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine,  verapamil), doxazosin, ketanserin and alpha-methyldopa. Atenolol effectively  lowers blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension and in women with  hypertension associated with pregnancy, and improves objective and subjective  indices in patients with stable angina pectoris. Oral atenolol is used for  preventing recurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias once control is achieved by  intravenous administration of atenolol. Early intervention with intravenous  atenolol followed by oral maintenance therapy reduces infarct recurrence and  cardiovascular mortality in patients with known or suspected myocardial  infarction. There is also encouraging evidence of reduced mortality from  cardiovascular disease during long term therapy with atenolol in patients with  hypertension. Atenolol is well tolerated in most patients. Increases in plasma  levels of both total triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)  triglycerides have accompanied atenolol therapy although the clinical relevance,  if any, of longer term metabolic effects has yet to be determined. Its low lipid  solubility and limited brain penetration results in a lower incidence of central  nervous system effects than that associated with propranolol. After many years of  clinical usage atenolol is a well established treatment option in several areas  of cardiovascular medicine such as mild to moderate hypertension and stable  angina pectoris. Furthermore, it has also shown potential in the treatment of  some cardiac arrhythmias and has been associated with reduced cardiovascular  mortality in patients with hypertension and in patients with myocardial  infarction.","1991-09","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","468-510","","3","42","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1720383","","","","Humans; Drug Evaluation; Coronary Disease/*drug therapy; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*drug therapy; Atenolol/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enalapril is rapidly converted by ester  hydrolysis to enalaprilat, a potent ACE inhibitor; enalapril itself is only a  weak ACE inhibitor. Enalapril lowers peripheral vascular resistance without  causing an increase in heart rate. In patients with congestive heart failure,  enalapril has beneficial hemodynamic effects based on reduction of both cardiac  preload and afterload. Approximately 60% of a dose of enalapril is absorbed after  oral administration. Excretion of enalaprilat is primarily renal. Accumulation of  enalaprilat occurs in patients with creatinine clearances less than 30 mL/min.  Enalapril 10-40 mg per day orally has shown efficacy comparable to that of  captopril in treating patients with mild, moderate, and severe hypertension,  hypertension caused by renal-artery stenosis, and in congestive heart failure  resistant to digitalis and diuretics. When given alone for hypertension,  enalapril has efficacy comparable to that of thiazide diuretics and beta  blockers. Side effects observed with enalapril have generally been minor.  Captopril-associated side effects such as skin rash, loss of taste, and  proteinuria have been observed in a small number of patients receiving enalapril  to date; neutropenia less than 300/mm3 has been noted with captopril but not  enalapril. The incidence of these side effects has been noted to be greatly  decreased in patients on low doses of captopril.

Preliminary  studies suggest that nilvadipine may also be useful in the treatment of patients  with stable exertional or variant angina. Studies conducted in Japan indicate  that nilvadipine improves symptoms resulting from cerebral infarction in some  patients, but further comparative studies are required to confirm these results.  The tolerability of nilvadipine appears to be comparable with that of nicardipine  and better than that of nifedipine with respect to flushes, oedema and liver  function abnormalities. As is typical of calcium antagonists, there is no  evidence of tolerance to the antihypertensive effects of nilvadipine. The drug is  equally effective in treating hypertension in elderly and younger patients and  does not appear to adversely affect glucose or lipid metabolism.

In small  comparative studies amlodipine was at least as effective as 'standard' agents,  including atenolol, verapamil, hydrochlorothiazide or captopril in hypertension,  and diltiazem or nadolol in angina pectoris. Amlodipine is well tolerated, and  does not appear to cause some of the undesirable effects often associated with  other cardiovascular agents (e.g. adverse changes in serum lipid patterns,  cardiac conduction disturbances, postural hypotension). The most common adverse  effects associated with amlodipine therapy--oedema and flushing--are related to  the vasodilatory action of the drug, and are generally mild to moderate in  severity. Thus, amlodipine seems to provide a useful alternative to other agents  currently available for the treatment of essential hypertension and chronic  stable angina pectoris, with certain pharmacodynamic and tolerability properties  that should be advantageous in many patients.","1991-03","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","478-505","","3","41","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1711448","","","","Humans; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy; Amlodipine; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Nifedipine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main challenge with antihypertensive (AHT) drug therapy is  their extreme hydrophobic nature and very low oral bio-availability; which result  into higher dosage/frequency and associated side effects of drugs. The main  objective of this study was to fabricate AHT nano-ceuticals in hydrophilic  carriers of natural origin to improve drugs' solubility, protection and sustained  release. AHT nano-carrier systems (NCS) encapsulating captopril, amlodipine and  valsartan were fabricated using chitosan (CS) polymer by ionic gelation assisted  ultra-sonication method. Drug encapsulation efficiencies of 92±1.6%, 91±0.9% and  87±0.5% were observed for captopril, valsartan and amlodipine respectively.  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based analysis had revealed that captopril  loaded polymeric NCS were regular, smooth and without any agglomeration. FTIR  analyses of drug loaded and empty NCS demonstrated that drugs were molecularly  dispersed inside the nanoparticles via week hydrogen bonding. Captopril and  valsartan have demonstrated grafting reaction with N-H group of chitosan. Zeta  sizer results had confirmed that average size of chitosan nanoparticles was below  100 nm. Encapsulation of captopril had reduced the surface charge value from  +52.6±4.8 to +46.5±5.2 mV. Controlled release evaluation of highly encapsulated  drug captopril had revealed a slow release in vitro from NCS in physiological  buffer. Thus, here reported innovative AHT nano-ceuticals of polymeric origin can  improve the oral administration of currently available hydrophobic drugs while  providing the extended-release function.","2016-05-20","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","268-274","","","142","","Carbohydr Polym","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two ACE  inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and two AT1 receptor antagonists, losartan  and telmisartan, on the protective action of gabapentin in the maximal  electroshock seizure threshold test in mice. Additionally, the effects of the  combined treatment with gabapentin and antihypertensive drugs on memory retention  in the passive avoidance task and motor coordination in the chimney test were  assessed. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally. Losartan (50mg/kg)  significantly increased the convulsive threshold for gabapentin. The other  antihypertensive drugs, captopril (50mg/kg), enalapril (30 mg/kg) and telmisartan  (30 mg/kg), did not affect the anticonvulsant activity of gabapentin. The  observed interaction between gabapentin and losartan could be pharmacokinetic in  nature. Losartan increased plasma and total brain concentrations of gabapentin.  In the chimney test, losartan (50mg/kg) administered with gabapentin (50mg/kg)  caused motor impairment. In the passive avoidance test, memory retention was not  affected by the combined treatment with gabapentin and antihypertensive drugs. It  is suggested that the use of captopril, enalapril and telmisartan in epileptic  patients receiving gabapentin is presumed neutral upon its anticonvulsant action.  The utmost caution is advised when combining losartan and gabapentin in clinical  practice due to the appearance of pharmacokinetic interactions between losartan  and gabapentin as well as motor impairment evoked by these drugs in mice.","2013-04-15","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","92-97","","1-3","706","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) bind specifically to the angiotensin type 1  receptor and may offer further benefits compared with ACE inhibitors.  Candesartan, losartan and valsartan have all been evaluated in large clinical  outcome trials in heart failure. They display marked differences in  pharmacokinetics and receptor-binding properties that may contribute to observed  differences in outcome. ELITE II found no significant difference in outcome with  losartan as compared with captopril. In the Val-Heft trial, valsartan reduced  heart failure hospitalisations when added to conventional therapy including an  ACE inhibitor in most patients, but had no effect on mortality. The CHARM  programme showed that candesartan reduced morbidity and mortality in heart  failure with reduced systolic function, both when added to ACE inhibitor therapy  or when used as an alternative in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors.  Moreover, the CHARM-preserved study suggested that candesartan is beneficial in  patients with heart failure and preserved left-ventricular systolic function.

Intriguingly, case reports and clinical  trials have indicated that ACEIs, including captopril and lisinopril, may have a  rapid mood-elevating effect in certain patients, but few experimental studies  have investigated their value as fast-onset antidepressants. METHODS: The present  study consisted of a series of experiments using biochemical assays,  immunohistochemistry, and behavioral techniques to examine the effect and  mechanism of captopril on depressive-like behavior in 2 animal models, the  chronic unpredictable stress model and the chronic social defeat stress model.  RESULTS: Captopril (19.5 or 39 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) exerted rapid  antidepressant activity in mice treated under the chronic unpredictable stress  model and mice treated under the chronic social defeat stress model.  Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that captopril crossed the blood-brain barrier  and that lisinopril, another ACEI with better blood-brain barrier permeability,  exerted a faster and longer-lasting effect at a same molar equivalent dose. This  antidepressant effect seemed to be independent of the renin-angiotensin system,  but dependent on the bradykinin (BK) system, since the decreased BK detected in  the stressed mice could be reversed by captopril. The hypofunction of the  downstream effector of BK, Cdc42 (cell division control protein 42) homolog,  contributed to the stress-induced loss of dendritic spines, which was rapidly  reversed by captopril via activating the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin  complex 1) pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the BK-dependent  activation of mTORC1 may represent a promising mechanism underlying  antidepressant pharmacology. Considering their affordability and availability,  ACEIs may emerge as a novel fast-onset antidepressant, especially for patients  with comorbid depression and hypertension.","2020-09-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","415-425","","5","88","","Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Although both drugs act on the renin-angiotensin system  via converting enzyme inhibition, their different chemical structures may dispose  them to different pharmacologic and physiologic activity. Both drugs exert a  vasodilator effect, with reduction of left and right ventricular filling  pressures and aortic impedance. In short-term hemodynamic studies, the onset of  action and peak effect are earlier with captopril. Enalapril has a much more  gradual onset and longer duration of action. Both drugs have a shallow  dose-response curve and both produce comparable hormonal changes: an increase in  plasma renin activity and a decrease in aldosterone levels. Captopril also  increases prostaglandin production. Long-term efficacy trials have demonstrated  symptomatic improvement in patients given captopril and those receiving enalapril  who were also receiving digitalis and diuretics. Baseline hemodynamics may not  predict long-term improvement. There are few adverse effects for the two drugs,  but their incidences differ, suggesting a relationship to chemical structure.  Recent studies in congestive heart failure suggest a reduction in mortality with  various drug regimens.","1986-10-31","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","36-39","","4C","81","","Am J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3022583","","","","Humans; Therapeutic Equivalency; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Captopril/*therapeutic use; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Aldosterone/metabolism; Renin/metabolism; Enalapril/*therapeutic use; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/mortality/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data from clinical studies have indicated that  benazepril 5 to 80 mg (usually 10 to 20 mg), administered as a single daily dose,  effectively decreases blood pressure in patients with mild to moderately severe  hypertension. In a small number of comparative studies, the anti-hypertensive  efficacy of benazepril appeared to be at least equivalent to that of captopril,  enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, nitrendipine or propranolol at usual  therapeutic doses. Combinations of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide or  nifedipine achieved a greater lowering of blood pressure than benazepril alone,  and this approach may be suitable for patients with more severe hypertension.  Benazepril is reported to have beneficial effects on various indices of cardiac  function and to improve clinical symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with  congestive heart failure. The tolerability of benazepril in clinical trials has  been very good, with an incidence of adverse effects similar to that observed in  placebo recipients. Thus, benazepril appears to be an effective alternative to  other members of its class for the management of hypertension, and further  studies will accurately define its usefulness in congestive heart failure.","1991-09","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","511-539","","3","42","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1720384","","","","Humans; Drug Evaluation; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Benzazepines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pharmacokinetics of the captopril-lysozyme  conjugate was studied in the rat. Only intact conjugate could be detected in the  circulation. The total amount of captopril disulfides in the kidney was six times  higher after administration of the conjugate than after the administration of an  equivalent amount of free captopril. The conjugate was recovered in the urine  partially as intact conjugate and partially as low-molecular-weight disulfides.  The excretion of conjugate in the urine was not a consequence of the coupling of  captopril to lysozyme because an equivalent bolus dose of native lysozyme was  similarly excreted into the urine. By determination of the renal  angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, we showed that the conjugate was degraded  to the pharmacologically active captopril in vivo.

The  release rate of captopril from the binary HP-beta-CyD system was rather fast,  whereas that from the binary TB-beta-CyD system was comparatively slower, the  retarding effect being dependent on the amounts of TB-beta-CyD. The release rate  from the ternary captopril/TB-beta-CyD/HP-beta-CyD system was slowed down by the  addition of small amounts of HP-beta-CyD, whereas the rate became faster as the  molar ratio of HP-beta-CyD further increased (>.25 molar ratio). Both water  penetration studies and microscopic observation suggested that the retarding  effect is attributable to a gel formation of HP-beta-CyD in the TB-beta-CyD  hydrophobic matrix. It was difficult to prolong plasma levels of captopril by  administering orally either the binary HP-beta-CyD or TB-beta-CyD system in dogs.  On the other hand, the ternary captopril/TB-beta-CyD/HP-beta-CyD system (molar  ratio of 1:0.5:0.5) gave a plasma profile comparable to that of a commercially  available sustained release preparation (Captoril R).

Ultimately, however, the result is of little  benefit if it does not lead to a change in patient management. To assess how  patient management was changed following the result of a captopril renogram, we  reviewed the notes of 95 patients who had undergone this test over a 5 year  period to identify renal artery stenosis. Of these patients, significant renal  artery stenosis was suggested in 16 (17%), of whom only 9 (56%) underwent a  change in management (7 proceeding to angiography with or without angioplasty, 2  having alterations in medication).

Finally, of the 12 patients who had a non-diagnostic renogram, 7  (60%) had a management change (3 angiography, 4 altered drug therapy). Our  results suggest that, despite evidence from the literature that captopril  renography is both sensitive and specific for renal artery stenosis, clinicians  still rely on other factors when determining who has significant stenosis and,  therefore, who should proceed to a further investigation or have a change in  medication.

Homogenization pressure (X1), oil/water ratio  (X2), and surfactant (X3) were selected as independent variables, whereas  particle size was considered as a dependent variable. Results indicated that  homogenization pressure was the main contributing variable for particle size. The  optimum values for homogenization pressure, oil/water ratio, and surfactant were  30MPa, 9.34:1, and 2.54g, respectively, whereas the particle size was predicted  to be 288.2 nm. Morphological, physical, chemical, and functional properties of  the RS3NPs were the assessed. Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light  scattering images showed that RS3NP granules were broken down to size of about  222.2nm.

Recent  therapeutic trials confirm that the efficacy of isradipine in the treatment of  patients with mainly mild to moderate hypertension, when administered orally as a  conventional or modified release preparation, is similar to that of titrated  dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa,  metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood  pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another  antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to  monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective  in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and  that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and  hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when  administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine  Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of  isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of carotid  artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early  atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased significantly  less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of therapy.  Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder of the  3-year trial. The confirmation of its antihypertensive efficacy, along with its  favourable haemodynamic profile and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy,  minimal effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, preservation of quality of life  and good tolerability, makes isradipine a suitable drug for the treatment of most  patients with mild to moderate hypertension.","1995-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","618-649","","4","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7789292","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Interactions; Pregnancy; Drug Therapy, Combination; Postoperative Complications/drug therapy; Hemodynamics/*drug effects; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Hypertension/*drug therapy/etiology; Isradipine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined renal perfusion  by arterial spin labeling in 15 healthy adults using a clinical 1.5-T MRI system,  twice under baseline conditions and 60 minutes after a single oral dose of 50 mg  captopril. Data evaluation included assessment of interstudy and interrater  reproducibility in addition to the pharmacological effect of captopril on kidney  perfusion and a sample size calculation for potential application of the  technique in pharmacological intervention studies. Interstudy reproducibility of  cortical and medullary kidney perfusion was excellent (intraclass correlation  coefficients 0.77 and 0.83, respectively). Interrater reproducibility was  excellent in the cortex and good in the medulla (intraclass correlation  coefficients 0.97 and 0.66, respectively). Ingestion of 50 mg captopril was  associated with an 11% drop of systolic blood pressure and a rise in kidney  perfusion by 22% in the cortex (369 ± 48 vs 452 ± 56 mL/[min·100 g], P < .001)  and 26% in the medulla (157 ± 39 to 198 ± 45 ml/[min·100 g]; P < .01).  Statistical power analysis revealed that a small sample size of only 6  participants is needed in a clinical trial to capture an equal change in kidney  perfusion to the one induced by 50 mg captopril with a statistical power of 82%  and an α error of 0.05. In conclusion, funtional MRI with arterial spin labeling  is a reliable method for quantification of kidney perfusion and for fast  assessment of pharmacologically induced renal perfusion changes, allowing low  case numbers.","2018-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","466-473","","4","58","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29125633","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hemodynamics; Regional Blood Flow; Antihypertensive Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics; Spin Labels; Captopril/blood/pharmacokinetics; Clinical Pharmacology (CPH); Clinical Research (CRE); Clinical Trials (CTR); Hypertension (HTN); Kidney/blood supply/*diagnostic imaging/physiology; Nephrology (NEP); Pharmaceutical R & D (PRD); Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism; Pharmacology (PHA); Renal Disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we compared the effects of captopril-lysozyme  and free captopril in male Wistar rats. ACE activity in plasma and the kidney was  measured after intravenous bolus injection of either the captopril-lysozyme  conjugate (33 mg. kg(-1), corresponding to 0.2 mg. kg(-1) captopril) or  equivalent dosages of free captopril and lysozyme. The administration of the  captopril-lysozyme conjugate resulted in less plasma ACE inhibition and a  longer-lasting renal ACE inhibition compared with the free drug. Effects on blood  pressure and natriuresis were studied during intravenous infusion of  captopril-lysozyme (275 mg. kg(-1). 6 h(-1) conjugate, corresponding to 5 mg.  kg(-1). 6 h(-1) captopril) or an equimolar dosage of free captopril.  Captopril-lysozyme did not affect systemic blood pressure, whereas free captopril  lowered blood pressure significantly (-23 +/- 32% versus control after 6 h).  Captopril-lysozyme increased natriuresis about 3-fold compared with control  levels (260 +/- 32% after 6 h), whereas free captopril treatment resulted in a  reduced sodium excretion (26 +/- 12%). Furthermore, captopril at a lower dose,  which only moderately lowered blood pressure, showed an increased sodium  excretion.

Myocardial failure,  irrespective of the aetiology, tends to create a vicious cycle characterised by  reduced cardiac output and elevated systemic vascular resistance, which further  decrease cardiac output by increasing left ventricular ejection impedance. The  rationale for the use of vasodilators is to interrupt the vicious cycle by  decreasing the left ventricular ejection impedance by peripheral vasodilatation.  Although most vasodilator agents produce qualitatively similar haemodynamic  responses, quantitatively their haemodynamic effects differ considerably.  Knowledge of the haemodynamic effects of the various vasodilators helps in the  selection of a particular drug for the management of such patients.

These include properties such as the drug's  potency, route of absorption and excretion, pharmacokinetics, drug disposition,  and toxicity. Although increased potency, a traditional method for improving  efficacy, can be achieved with angiotensin-converting inhibitors by introducing  additional binding sites or by increasing the strength of binding at existing  sites, safety testing has shown that with some compounds this approach may cause  nephrotoxicity. Because renal disease is a common cause of hypertension and the  two conditions frequently coexist, in some patients agents that are eliminated by  both renal and hepatobiliary routes may be more desirable than those eliminated  almost exclusively by the kidneys, such as captopril. This and other shortcomings  of captopril have led to the development of two new angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors, zofenopril and fosfenopril, which are both in the early phase of  clinical investigation. The former is an analog of captopril and the latter is  classified as a first phosphinic acid angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.  Another possibility for the future is the incorporation of two therapeutic  objectives into a single compound in the form of an angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitory diuretic which, although chemically feasible, may be of questionable  practical value. Also, the success of blood pressure control through intervention  at the level of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has created interest in  the development of renin inhibitors. The primary stimulus for this avenue of  investigation was the specificity of renin, which has only one substrate while  converting enzyme has many.","1985","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","S30-34","","","7 Suppl 1","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2580173","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Animals; Intestinal Absorption; Binding Sites; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacology; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; *Fosinopril/*analogs & derivatives; Organophosphorus Compounds/pharmacology; Diuretics/pharmacology; Renin/antagonists & inhibitors/blood; Captopril/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology; Snake Venoms/analysis; Zinc/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A layer of myofibroblasts forming a pericryptal sheath  surrounds the colonic crypt epithelial cells. The colonic pericryptal  hypertonicity (250--350 mM NaCl) resulting from Na(+) pumping into the space  between the crypt epithelial cells and the myofibroblasts provides the driving  force required to produce the suction tension (5-10 atmospheres) that dehydrates  feces. [Na(+)] in the pericryptal space and crypt lumen is monitored in vivo with  a Na(+) ion-sensitive fluorescent dye, Sodium Red. Dietary Na+ restriction  increases this hypertonicity. The rate of dextran--labeled with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC--accumulation in the crypt lumen monitors fluid absorption  by the crypt lumen. The rate of leakage of FITC dextran (10 kDa) across the crypt  wall reflects its permeability. With low Na(+) intake, there is decreased crypt  luminal dextran permeability. This decrease in crypt permeability is due to  increased systemic and local release of angiotensin II and TGF-beta and is  accompanied by pericryptal growth stimulation with consequent increased  expression of myofibroblast proteins, smooth muscle actin, collagen 4, and OB  cadherin. Inhibition of cytokine formation by the angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitor (ACEI) captopril prevents these trophic effects. Colonic fluid  absorption is inhibited 4 days after whole-body exposure to ionizing radiation of  >8 Gy. Concurrently, there is loss of the pericryptal myofibroblasts resulting  from apoptosis, with consequent loss of the barrier function of the pericryptal  sheath. These effects cause increased rates of dextran leakage across the crypt  wall and loss of myofibroblast markers. Normal colonic function returns after 10  days accompanied by repair of the pericryptal sheath. The caspase inhibitor,  Z-VAD Fmk, reduces sheath apoptosis. Longer term irradiation of >8 Gy produces  overgrowth of the myofibroblasts and fibrosis, which is inhibited by captopril.","2004","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","79-97","","2","23","","J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15163287","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Microscopy, Confocal; Diet, Sodium-Restricted; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Colon/physiology/*radiation effects; Fibroblasts/metabolism/*radiation effects; Intestinal Absorption/physiology/*radiation effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  important trials for the various indications are briefly discussed. In  Switzerland 11 ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, differing mainly in  their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The characteristics of  practical relevance regarding oral bioavailability, elimination mechanisms and  half-life, as well as the necessary dosage modifications in patients with renal,  hepatic and cardiac failure, are presented. All ACE inhibitors except captopril  and lisinopril are administered as prodrugs. The bioavailability among ACE  inhibitors varies widely with a range from 11% (trandolapril) to more than 60%  (captopril). The great majority of ACE inhibitors are eliminated predominantly  through the kidneys. However, benazepril, fosinopril, ramipril, spirapril and  trandolapril also have a hepatic (metabolic) route of elimination. Since  half-life varies from 1 h (captopril) to 30 h (spirapril) we drew up, for  simplicity, a table of 3 groups with short, medium and long t1/2. In renal  insufficiency dose adjustment is required only below a creatinine-clearance level  of 30 ml/min. These dosage reductions are not required in liver diseases, but  renally excreted drugs such as lisinopril should be preferred. Treatment with ACE  inhibitors in severe heart failure should be initiated carefully, with low doses  and concomitant diuretic treatment added or maintained. Most common adverse  effects of ACE inhibitors are hypotension, cough, hyperkalaemia and renal  failure. Less frequent adverse effects are angioedema, bone marrow suppression  and also foetal damage. Thus, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy.","1999-07-27","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1053-1060","","29-30","129","","Schweiz Med Wochenschr","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 10464907","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Pregnancy; Contraindications; Diabetic Angiopathies/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/drug therapy; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Diabetic Nephropathies/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The demonstration that the  hemoregulatory peptide acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) is a natural and specific  substrate of the N-active site of ACE suggests that this enzyme may have a new  physiological role such as the modulation of hematopoietic stem cells. In vitro  studies have shown that ACE inhibitors displayed various potencies in inhibiting  the degradation of different natural or synthetic substrates of ACE, among which  captopril inhibits AcSDKP hydrolysis more potently than angiotensin I hydrolysis.  To look for this selectivity in vivo, we investigated the pharmacodynamic effect  of increasing doses of captopril (0.01-10 mg/kg) during the 90 min after i.v.  administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats. Plasma and urinary AcSDKP  levels were measured. The renin-angiotensin system was evaluated by measurements  of ACE activity in plasma samples, using the synthetic substrate Hip-His-Leu, by  determinations of plasma renin concentrations and measurements of arterial blood  pressure. The results showed that captopril (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) selectively  inhibited AcSDKP hydrolysis, with limited effects on the renin-angiotensin  system. AcSDKP levels in plasma and urine rose to a plateau 4 times the basal  level for doses more than 0.3 mg/kg. All of the parameters reflecting the  renin-angiotensin system were significantly affected at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg.  The present study therefore confirms that captopril can be used to protect  hematopoietic stem cells during antitumor chemotherapy while having only a  limited effect on cardiovascular homeostasis.","1999-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1257-1261","","3","289","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10336514","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Substrate Specificity; Rats; Time Factors; Injections, Intravenous; Hydrolysis; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Renin/blood; Rats, Inbred SHR; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*blood; Oligopeptides/*pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin I/*metabolism; Captopril/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Captopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) used effectively for the  management of hypertension. Due to short elimination half-life of captopril the  oral dose is very high. Captopril is prone to oxidation and it has been reported  that the oxidation rate of captopril in skin tissues is considerably low when  compared to intestinal tissues. All these factors make captopril an ideal drug  candidate for transdermal delivery. In this research work an effort was made to  formulate transdermal films of captopril by utilizing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)  and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as film formers and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400)  as a plasticizer. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF) were used  as permeation enhancers. Physicochemical parameters of the films such as  appearance, thickness, weight variation and drug content were evaluated. The  invitro permeation studies were carried out through excised human cadaver skin  using Franz diffusion cells. The in-vitro permeation studies demonstrated that  the film (P4) having the polymer ratio (PVP:PVA = 80:20) with DMSO (10%) resulted  a promising drug release of 79.58% at 24 hours with a flux of 70.0 µg/cm(2)/hr.  No signs of erythema or oedema were observed on the rabbit skin as a result of  skin irritation study by Draize test. Based on the stability report it was  confirmed that the films were physically and chemically stable, hence the  prepared films are very well suited for transdermal application.","2015","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","517-523","","5","12","","Curr Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 25675336","","","","Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Rabbits; Cadaver; Permeability/drug effects; Administration, Cutaneous; Polyvinyl Alcohol/chemistry; Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry; Povidone/chemistry; *Skin Absorption/drug effects; Skin/drug effects/*metabolism; *Transdermal Patch; Captopril/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Dimethyl Sulfoxide/chemistry/pharmacology; Dimethylformamide/chemistry/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In patients with symptomatic heart failure, enalapril reduces  overall mortality, death from progressive heart failure and hospitalisation  rates. In those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, enalapril  decreases the combined risk of death and development of heart failure, and the  risk of death and hospitalisation. The effects of enalapril in reducing  hospitalisation rates in symptomatic patients translate into net savings in  healthcare costs in heart failure. Enalapril also produces modest benefits in  quality-of-life (QOL) parameters in patients with symptomatic heart failure as  shown in well controlled studies. Its effects appear similar to those of  hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate. The influence of enalapril on quality of  life in patients with asymptomatic disease is minimal but not deleterious.  Enalapril generally either maintains or slightly improves quality of life from  baseline in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The drug appears to have  a QOL profile that is more favourable than that of propranolol and similar to  those of most other comparator drugs, as assessed by subjective measures of  quality of life. Clarification is required of its QOL profile relative to that of  captopril, in view of conflicting results in the literature. The effects of  enalapril on cognitive and psychomotor function appear to resemble those of  comparator agents. Thus, enalapril has modest beneficial effects on the quality  of life of patients with symptomatic heart failure, while generally maintaining  quality of life in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or  mild to moderate hypertension. Enalapril is a cost-effective treatment in heart  failure that would be expected to yield considerable cost savings in this  therapeutic area.","1994-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","155-182","","2","6","","Pharmacoeconomics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 10147441","","","","Humans; Treatment Outcome; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drug Therapy, Combination; Exercise; *Quality of Life; Hypertension/*drug therapy/epidemiology; *Economics, Pharmaceutical; *Enalapril/economics/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unique and effective therapy for hypertension and congestive heart failure.","Postgraduate medicine","","0032-5481","10.1080/00325481.1985.11699167","","Major developments in the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure have occurred  since the discovery of captopril in June 1975. Early in the past decade, this  oral ACE inhibitor was restricted to refractory and severe cases of hypertension.  By July 1985, the Food and Drug Administration approved its use not only for all  degrees of hypertension but also for the initial treatment of hypertensive  patients with uncomplicated disease. New information has confirmed the  effectiveness of twice-daily administration (which favorably influences  compliance) and the lack of a need to monitor blood or urine levels to assure  safety. The renin-mediated and non-renin-mediated mechanisms of action of  captopril-induced ACE inhibition have been fully delineated, as has its side  effect profile, which does not include various CNS, sympathetic reflex, and  metabolic side effects seen with other antihypertensive agents. As the first  vasodilator to prove its efficacy in the acute and chronic treatment of  congestive heart failure to the FDA, captopril is now widely used throughout the  United States. ACE inhibition reduces symptoms, enhances exercise capacity, and  favorably affects sodium, water, and potassium homeostasis in patients with heart  failure. Also, recent but as yet unconfirmed evidence suggests that ACE  inhibition may prolong survival in these patients. The success of captopril, the  first oral agent of this class, promises to hold true for other ACE inhibitors  (such as enalapril), which have similar activities but differing pharmacokinetic  properties and will soon be available for clinical use. Further information on  these newer agents is anxiously awaited. In the near future, the clinician will  undoubtedly be able to choose from a large selection of ACE inhibitors for the  treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Therefore, it is important to learn  about any meaningful differences among ACE inhibitors and to contrast this class  of agents with older, standard therapies. This learning process is crucial as we  assess whether newer agents offer clinical advantages over the old.","1985-10","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","229-41, 244, 247-248","","5","78","","Postgrad Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2864682","","","","Humans; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use; Erythema/chemically induced; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Neutropenia/chemically induced; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects; Captopril/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Enalapril/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Hypotension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Taste/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sustained release of captopril from floating matrices has been  studied varying the antioxidant load, the sodium bicarbonate proportion and the  compaction pressure. Although in many cases the effect of compaction pressure  remains hidden, actual results show that matrices compacted at 55 MPa have  smaller density and float in the dissolution medium while those compacted at 165  MPa float only adding sodium bicarbonate. The increase of compaction pressure  reduces the hydration volume and increases the time necessary to attain its  maximum. These changes are attributed to lower matrix porosity and to the  consequent diminution of water and drug transport. Increasing ascorbic acid  proportions increase the matrix hydration volume and the drug released. The use  of sodium ascorbate and the substitution of 15% polymer with sodium bicarbonate  reduce the matrix hydration volume, shorten the matrix hydration process and  increase the drug released. This is attributed to carbon dioxide bubbles that  decrease the matrix coherence and expand the matrix volume, facilitating drug  dissolution and only a limited further matrix expansion. The antioxidant  protection provided by sodium ascorbate was lesser of that of ascorbic acid  because of greater molecular mass and lesser release rate.","2010-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","230-240","","3","15","","Pharm Dev Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22716463","","","","Tablets; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/*methods; Delayed-Action Preparations/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Compressive Strength; Captopril/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Antioxidants/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, several new ACE inhibitors  with pharmacokinetic features different from earlier agents such as captopril or  enalapril have come into use. This review discusses the use of pharmacokinetics  to optimise ACE inhibitory therapy in various patient groups. Among the  pharmacokinetic characteristics of ACE inhibitors the route of excretion and to a  lesser degree the half-life appear to be the most clinically relevant. There is  no evidence that being a prodrug offers a significant clinical advantage. The  importance of varying tissue penetration also remains to be determined. Knowledge  of ACE inhibitor pharmacokinetics is particularly important in patients with  renal or hepatic dysfunction in whom the major route of excretion of these agents  is impaired. This might also be the case in elderly patients or those with severe  congestive heart failure. However, for most ACE inhibitors, major changes in the  drug dosage (amount or interval) are necessary only when the glomerular  filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min (1.80 L/h).

Part of the  explanation for this lies in differences in pharmacological properties. Depending  on the kinetics of elimination, the trough:peak ratio of short- and long-acting  ACE inhibitors has to be evaluated according to a dose regimen of twice or once a  day, respectively, and must take account of the dose used, since long-acting ACE  inhibitors appear to have a dose-dependent trough:peak effect. Further  explanations for the contradictory trough:peak ratios reported for ACE inhibitors  include measurement methods (clinic blood pressure versus ambulatory monitoring)  and study design. TROUGH:PEAK RATIO: Data from randomly allocated,  placebo-controlled studies indicate that both the short-acting ACE inhibitors  captopril and quinapril given twice a day and the long-acting ACE inhibitors  enalapril, lisinopril, benazepril and cilazapril given once a day have an  acceptable trough:peak ratio (> 50%). The evidence suggests that when chemically  different ACE inhibitors with similar kinetics of elimination are administered at  equipotent doses, similar trough:peak ratios are obtained.","1994-11","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","S91-4; discussion S94-95","","8","12","","J Hypertens Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 7707164","","","","Humans; Research Design; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to clarify whether combined  administration of an ACE inhibitor, captopril, with an antihypertensive  di-peptide Val-Tyr (VY) would alter their potent antihypertensive effects in  spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Single oral administration of captopril  (2.5 mg/kg), VY (25 mg/kg), or captopril (2.5 mg/kg)+VY (25 mg/kg) to 18-week-old  male SHRs was performed. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured up to 9 h,  and plasma captopril concentrations were determined. A transport study of  captopril and/or VY across living rat jejunum from SHRs was also performed to  evaluate the kinetics of absorption. Combined administration of captopril with VY  failed to lower the BP during the 9-h experiment. A transport study of captopril  or VY revealed that VY inhibited captopril transport, and vice versa, in a  competitive manner and exhibited an approximately 1/3-fold lower Ki value for  captopril compared with that for VY; indicating that both compounds compete for  the same membrane transport pathway. A 50% decrease in plasma captopril levels by  combined administration with VY supported that the attenuation of the BP lowering  effect was due to inhibition of captopril uptake by VY. Consequently, our  findings suggest that subjects treated with ACE inhibitors for hypertension  should avoid combined-intake with antihypertensive foods that are rich in small  peptides due to the competitive inhibition of drug uptake by these peptides.","2006-11-25","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","2492-2498","","26","79","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 16959271","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Drug Therapy, Combination; Biological Transport/drug effects; Rats, Inbred SHR; Jejunum/drug effects/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Captopril/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Dipeptides/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/physiopathology/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The renal response to captopril or  nicardipine was different in IDD.

Principle component  analysis (PCA) and principle component regression (PCR) were employed to identify  and quantify the effects of formulation variables and physico-mechanical  properties of the film on the drug permeability. PCA classified three distinct  groups of film formulations based on their composition and properties. PCR  quantified the impact of main variables, their interactions, and square effects  on the drug permeability. The main effect of the aqueous phase exhibited a  negative impact, while that of flux and tensile strength showed a positive impact  on the permeability. Interactions of primary emulsions with disintegration time  and tensile strength displayed a synergistic impact. Interactions of aqueous  phase with flux, Young's moduli, and tensile strength, as well as between Young's  moduli and tensile strength showed a significant positive effect on the  permeability. A negative correlation of square effects of primary emulsion and  flux, and a positive square effect of Young's moduli confirmed their non-linear  influence on the drug permeability across porcine buccal mucosa.

The molecular weight  of the copolymer was adjusted by varying the content of methacrylic acid (MAA)  while keeping that of N-vinylcaprolactam (NVCL) constant. Hydrophilic captopril  and hydrophobic ketoprofen were used as model drugs, and PNVCL-co-MAA nanofibers  were used as the drug carrier to investigate the effects of drug on its release  properties from nanofibers at different temperatures. The results showed that  slow release over several hours was observed at 40°C (above the lower critical  solution temperature (LCST) of PNVCL-co-MAA), while the drugs exhibited a burst  release of several seconds at 20°C (below the LCST). Drug release slowed with  increasing content of the hydrophobic monomer NVCL. The hydrophilic captopril was  released at a higher rate than the hydrophobic ketoprofen. The drug release  characteristics were dependent on the temperature, the portion of hydrophilic  groups and hydrophobic groups in the copolymer and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity  of drug.

Furthermore, the  co-administration of these compounds with some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs;  carbamazepine, diazepam, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital,  phenytoin, topiramate and valproate) was studied in order to identify possible  positive interactions in the same model. All ACEi were able to decrease the  severity of audiogenic seizures with the exception of enalapril up to the dose of  100mg/kg, the rank order of activity was as follows:  fosinopril>zofenopril>captopril. The co-administration of ineffective doses of  all ACE inhibitors with AEDs, generally increased the potency of the latter.  Fosinopril was the most active in potentiating the activity of AEDs and the  combination of ACEi with lamotrigine and valproate was the most favorable,  whereas, the co-administrations with diazepam and phenobarbital seemed to be  neutral. The increase in potency was generally associated with an enhancement of  motor impairment, however, the therapeutic index of combined treatment of AEDs  with ACEi was predominantly more favorable than control. ACEi administration did  not influence plasma and brain concentrations of the AEDs studied excluding  pharmacokinetic interactions and concluding that it is of pharmacodynamic nature.  In conclusion, fosinopril, zofenopril, enalapril and captopril showed an additive  anticonvulsant effect when co-administered with some AEDs, most notably  carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate and valproate, implicating a  possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations.","2012-03","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","285-296","","3","65","","Pharmacol Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

W.","Current status of cardiac glycoside drug interactions.","Clinical pharmacy","","0278-2677","","","The effects of concomitant drug therapy on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of digoxin and digitoxin are reviewed. A number of agents can  increase or decrease the absorption of digoxin and digitoxin from the  gastrointestinal tract by altering GI motility, binding the drugs through  physical adsorption, altering the properties of the intestinal wall, or altering  the bacterial flora of the intestine. The steady-state serum concentrations of  digoxin and digitoxin can be affected if the changes in absorption are of  sufficient magnitude, and adjustments in digoxin or digitoxin dosage may be  required. A reduction in digoxin and digitoxin protein binding has occurred  during concomitant administration of heparin and cardiac glycosides. Since  digitoxin is more highly protein bound than digoxin, interactions that involve  changes in protein binding are of much greater clinical importance with  digitoxin. A number of drugs increase or decrease the elimination of digoxin and  digitoxin, and subtherapeutic or toxic concentrations of the cardiac glycosides  often result. Drugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes can increase the  elimination of digitoxin, which is eliminated mainly by hepatic  biotransformation. Digoxin is eliminated mainly by renal excretion; renal  clearance of digoxin may be increased by vasodilators and thyroid hormones and  decreased by quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and potassium-sparing diuretics.  The clinical importance of changes in serum concentrations of the cardiac  glycosides that result from alterations in glycoside elimination requires further  study, as does the importance of preliminary reports of interactions between  cardiac glycosides and diazepam, captopril, and combination therapy with  quinidine-pentobarbital or quinidine-rifampin. Because the cardiac glycosides  have a narrow therapeutic range, patients receiving concomitant therapy with  agents that might affect the absorption, distribution, or elimination of the  cardiac glycosides should be monitored carefully for symptoms of digitalis  toxicity or undertreatment.","1985-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","404-413","","4","4","","Clin Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2412751","","","","Humans; Intestinal Absorption; *Drug Interactions; Quinidine/pharmacology; Cimetidine/pharmacology; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/pharmacology; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology; Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology; Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology; Heparin/pharmacology; Gastrointestinal Agents/pharmacology; Diuretics/pharmacology; Antithyroid Agents/pharmacology; Cardiac Glycosides/metabolism/*pharmacology; Digitoxin/blood/metabolism/pharmacology/urine; Digoxin/blood/metabolism/pharmacology/urine; Thyroid Hormones/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We previously demonstrated that propofol enhances vasodilation in  mesenteric arteries from aged rats, partly due to increased nitric oxide (NO)  bioavailability. Patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors may exhibit refractory hypotension under general anesthesia. We  hypothesized that propofol enhances NO-mediated vasodilation in arteries from  aged rats chronically treated with ACE inhibitors. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats  aged 12 to 13 months were treated with or without captopril for 7 to 8 weeks,  yielding a final age of 14 to 15 months at the time of experimentation. Before  euthanasia, arterial blood pressures were obtained through carotid artery  cannulation. Concentration-response curves to propofol (0.1-100 µM) or  methacholine (MCh) (0.01-3 µM) were then assessed on isolated resistance  mesenteric arteries (100-200 μm diameter) from both treatment (captopril) and  control rats. MCh relaxation was also assessed after propofol pretreatment (1 and  10 µM). N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (100 µM) and meclofenamate  (10 µM) were used to inhibit NO and prostaglandin synthesis, respectively.  Concentration-response data were summarized as 50% of the maximum relaxation  response or area under the curve. RESULTS: Mean arterial blood pressure in the  captopril-treated rats was lower than in untreated rats (P = 0.049). When  comparing relaxation in arteries from captopril-treated versus untreated rats,  concentration-response curves revealed that captopril-treated rats display  greater direct propofol relaxation (P = 0.018). MCh relaxation in the absence of  propofol, however, was not different between captopril-treated and untreated rats  (P = 0.80). Propofol pretreatment increased MCh relaxation in arteries from  captopril-treated compared with untreated rats (P = 0.029 for 1 µM and P = 0.020  for 10 µM). Meclofenamate did not have an effect in this response (P = 0.22).  l-NAME-dependent inhibition of MCh relaxation, however, was greater in arteries  from control compared with captopril-treated rats (P = 0.0077). However, propofol  increased the proportion of NO-dependent vasodilation to MCh similarly in both  groups. This suggests that other vasodilatory pathways are involved in the  differential response to MCh in the presence of propofol in captopril-treated  rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that mesenteric arterial relaxation in  response to propofol, both by direct stimulation and through modulation of  endothelium-dependent mechanisms, is, in part, NO-dependent. In captopril-treated  rats, propofol further increased arterial relaxation through a non-NO-dependent  vasodilating pathway (e.g., endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor), which  may account for enhanced vasodilation during propofol exposure in patients  treated with ACE inhibitors.","2013-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","775-783","","4","116","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23429803","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Area Under Curve; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Aging/*physiology; Muscle Relaxation/drug effects; Nitric Oxide/physiology; Anesthetics, Intravenous/*pharmacology; Propofol/*pharmacology; Vasoconstrictor Agents/pharmacology; NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/pharmacology; Captopril/*pharmacology; Phenylephrine/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Endothelium, Vascular/physiology; Methacholine Chloride/pharmacology; Muscarinic Agonists/pharmacology; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*drug effects; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the predictability of changes  in the exposure to captopril, tiopronin, the active form of dalcetrapib and the  active metabolite of prasugrel, R-138727, all of which have a sulfhydryl group,  in moderate and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using a constructed  PBPK model. The changes in the exposure to captopril, tiopronin and the active  form of dalcetrapib under CKD conditions were well predicted. However, the change  in exposure to R-138727, which is a secondary metabolite of prasugrel, was  overpredicted. Although these thiol compounds covalently bind to endogenous  thiols, our study concluded that changes in exposure to these compounds under CKD  conditions can probably be predicted, except for compounds with a complicated  mechanism whereby the thiol metabolite is generated.","2021-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","31-39","","1","51","","Xenobiotica","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32744915","","","","Humans; pharmacokinetics; Pharmacokinetics; PBPK; CKD; Esters; Amides; renal impairment; covalent; dalcetrapib; disulfide; Patients; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*metabolism; Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism; thiol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats were  intraperitoneally injected with the chelating agents (1.2 mmol/kg each)  immediately after intravenous injection of AuTM (0.026 mmol/kg). Treatment with  captopril or tiopronin significantly prevented increases in the urinary excretion  of protein, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and glucose and the blood urea  nitrogen (BUN) level after AuTM injection. L-NAC and D-Cys significantly  prevented increases in the urinary excretion of protein, AST, and glucose after  AuTM injection, but did not reduce to control levels. Treatment with BGD, EDTA,  or L-Cys did not prevent AuTM-induced increases in the urinary excretion of  protein, AST, and glucose and BUN level. Tiopronin significantly increased the  urinary excretion of gold. Captopril slightly promoted both the urinary and fecal  excretion of gold, resulting in the significant increase in the total excretion  of the metal. Tiopronin and captopril significantly decreased the gold  concentration in the kidney and liver. L-Cys, D-Cys, L-NAC, BGD, and EDTA had no  significant effect on the excretion or distribution of gold at 7 days after AuTM  injection.

Our basic hypothesis was that  a decreased RFR may be used as an early indicator of renal deterioration, i.e. a  test to disclose significant obstruction as opposed to simple dilatation in  hydronephrosis. During various forms of stimulation (amino acids, captopril and  dopamine), we measured changes in GFR, renal plasma flow (RPF), tubular  reabsorption of sodium and water, net uptake from plasma to the kidney of three  salt and water homeostatic hormones (angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial  natriuretic peptide) and of glucagon, which is thought to play a key role as  mediator of the GFR increase during amino acid infusion. We found the largest GFR  increase during combined infusion of amino acids and dopamine (+13%), but  compared with a non-stimulated control group, the GFR increase was statistically  non-significant. RPF increased by 57% during stimulation with amino acids plus  dopamine (P < 0.001), while tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, and renal  uptake of angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide showed no  significant differences between control and stimulation groups. The renal uptake  of glucagon increased significantly during amino acid stimulation with no  concomitant GFR increase. We conclude that in this experimental, non-obstructed  model, RFR is a very insensitive measure, which cannot be used to discriminate  between obstruction and simple dilatation in hydronephrosis. Further, our study  does not support the hypothesis that glucagon is involved in GFR changes after  amino acids.","1997-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","57-69","","1","17","","Clin Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9015658","","","","Female; Animals; Organ Size; Hematocrit; Blood Pressure; Pulse; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Vascular Resistance; Dopamine/*pharmacology; Captopril/*pharmacology; Aldosterone/blood; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood; Angiotensin II/blood; Sodium/blood/urine; Renal Circulation/physiology; Kidney Tubules/*physiology; Swine/*physiology; Amino Acids/*pharmacology; Nephrons/physiology; Glucagon/pharmacokinetics; Kidney/growth & development/metabolism/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C, Materials for biological applications","","1873-0191 0928-4931","10.1016/j.msec.2016.07.070","","Mini-tablets are a new tendency in solid dosage form design for overcoming therapeutic obstacles such as impaired swallowing and polypharmacy therapy. Among  their advantages, these systems offer therapeutic benefits such as dose  flexibility and combined drug release patterns. The use of lipids in the  formulation has also drawn considerable interest as means to modify the drug  release from the dosage form. Therefore, this paper aimed at developing sustained  release mini-tablets containing the highly soluble drugs captopril and metformin  hydrochloride. Carnauba wax was used as a lipid component in melt granulation,  targeting the improvement of the drugs poor flowability and tabletability, as  well as to sustain the drug release profiles in association with other  excipients. To assist sustaining the drug release, Ethocel™ (EC) and Kollicoat®  SR 30D associated with Opadry® II were employed as matrix-forming and  reservoir-forming materials, respectively. The neat drugs, granules and the bulk  formulations were evaluated for their angle of repose, compressibility index,  Hausner ratio and tabletability. Mini-tablets were evaluated for their weight  variation, hardness, friability, drug content and in-vitro drug release. The  results indicated that melt granulation with carnauba wax improved the flow and  the tabletability of the drugs, allowing the preparation of mini-tablets with  adequate tensile strength under reduced compaction pressures. All mini-tablet  formulations showed acceptable hardness (within the range of 1.16 to 3.93Kp) and  friability (<0.1%). The melt-granulated captopril in matrix systems containing  50% EC (45P, 100P or 100FP) and the melt-granulated metformin hydrochloride in  reservoir systems coated with Kollicoat® SR 30D and Opadry® II (80:20 with 10%  weight gain or 70:30 with 20% weight gain) exhibited release profiles adequate to  sustained release formulations, for over 450min. Therefore, carnauba wax proved  to be a promising excipient in melt granulation targeting the preparation of  mini-tablets for sustained release of soluble drugs.","2017-01-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","250-257","","Pt 1","70","","Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recent reference-based pricing measures have targeted several drug  classes, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The objective  of this study was to assess whether patients treated for hypertension with  various ACE inhibitors differed in their utilization of health care services and  hence, whether the various ACE inhibitors should be considered therapeutically  equivalent. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was formed from 4709 Saskatchewan  residents aged 40-79 years who initiated treatment for hypertension with 1 of the  3 most frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril or lisinopril)  between Jan. 1, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1993. Information obtained from universal  insurance databases included prescription drug use, the number of visits to a  general practitioner (GP) or specialist and the number of hospital admissions  during the year before treatment was initiated and during a follow-up period of  up to 4 years. Rates were statistically adjusted for potential confounding  variables and compared across treatment groups. RESULTS: Of the 4709 patients,  529 were prescribed captopril initially, 2939 enalapril and 1241 lisinopril.  After treatment was initiated patients prescribed captopril were dispensed more  medications on average, with an overall rate of 18.6 prescriptions per patient  per year (v. 16.4 and 14.7 for enalapril and lisinopril users respectively); they  were admitted to hospital more often, and they made more visits to GPs and  specialists. The adjusted rate ratio of the number of visits to a GP for patients  receiving enalapril, relative to captopril, was 0.84 (95% confidence interval  [CI] 0.80-0.88), and for those receiving lisinopril it was 0.79 (95% CI  0.74-0.83). The adjusted rate ratios for the number of visits to a specialist  were similar but lower, and for the number of hospital admissions they were 0.82  for patients prescribed enalapril initially (95% CI 0.73-0.93) and 0.65 (95% CI  0.56-0.75) for those prescribed lisinopril. INTERPRETATION: Patients with  hypertension who are initially prescribed captopril used health care services  more than those initially prescribed enalapril or lisinopril. This suggests that  ACE inhibitors may not be therapeutically equivalent.","1999-08-10","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","255-260","","3","161","","CMAJ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 10463046  PMCID: PMC1230501","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Cohort Studies; Therapeutic Equivalency; Retrospective Studies; Hypertension/*drug therapy; *Economics, Pharmaceutical; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*economics/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Cost Control; Drug Prescriptions/*economics; Health Services/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

W.","Effects of different angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on ischemic isolated rat hearts: relationship between cardiac ACE inhibition and  cardioprotection.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","","0022-3565","","","We determined the relationship between cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and anti-ischemic efficacy of several structurally different ACE  inhibitors or their prodrug esters perfused through the isolated rat heart. Seven  ACE inhibitors inhibited cardiac ACE to varying degrees due to differences in  uptake during perfusion through nonischemic rat hearts. Zofenopril-sulfhydryl and  fosinoprilic acid were the most effective of the free inhibitors. Among the  prodrugs, zofenopril and S-benzoylcaptopril, hydrolyzed rapidly by cardiac  esterase, were more effective than their component ACE-inhibitors, whereas  fosinopril, ramipril and enalapril were poorly active. For studies in ischemic  rat hearts, vehicle or drug treatment was initiated 10 min before a 25-min period  of global ischemia and during a 30-min reperfusion period. Of five unesterified  ACE inhibitors studied for anti-ischemic activity, only captopril and  zofenopril-sulfhydryl were found to improve postischemic contractile function and  reduce cell death in the isolated rat hearts. Fosinoprilic acid, ramiprilat and  enalaprilat were not cardioprotective at high perfusion concentrations, despite  the fact that nearly complete inhibition of cardiac ACE was achieved with all of  the compounds studied. The S-benzoyl prodrugs of zofenopril-sulfhydryl and  captopril were at least as potent as their component ACE inhibitors in reducing  ischemic-reperfusion damage in the same model. Neither zofenopril nor captopril,  however, had any effect on coronary flow before or after ischemia. Thus, it  appears that the cardioprotective effects of zofenopril and captopril are  independent of cardiac ACE inhibition or, at least, that ACE inhibition alone is  not sufficient. Both captopril and zofenopril are sulfhydryl-containing compounds  whereas the inactive compounds are not; and, thus, this group appears to be  important in mediating their cardioprotective actions.","1991-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","919-929","","3","257","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1646329","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Drug Stability; Coronary Disease/drug therapy; Pyrroles/pharmacology; *Fosinopril/*analogs & derivatives; *Ramipril/*analogs & derivatives; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Captopril/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Enalaprilat/pharmacology; Heart/*drug effects; Myocardium/*enzymology/metabolism; Organophosphorus Compounds/pharmacology; Prodrugs/pharmacology; Proline/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though the conclusions  drawn from published data are quite inconsistent, in most review articles PEPT1  is claimed to mediate the intestinal absorption of ACE inhibitors and thus to  determine their oral availability. We systematically investigated the interaction  of a series of ACE inhibitors with PEPT1 and PEPT2. First, we studied the effect  of 14 ACE inhibitors including new drugs on the uptake of the dipeptide  [14C]glycylsarcosine into human intestinal Caco-2 cells constitutively expressing  PEPT1 and rat renal SKPT cells expressing PEPT2. In a second approach, the  interaction of ACE inhibitors with heterologously expressed human PEPT1 and PEPT2  was determined. In both assay systems, zofenopril and fosinopril were found to  have very high affinity for binding to peptide transporters. Medium to low  affinity for transporter interaction was found for benazepril, quinapril,  trandolapril, spirapril, cilazapril, ramipril, moexipril, quinaprilat, and  perindopril. For enalapril, lisinopril, and captopril, very weak affinity or lack  of interaction was found. Transport currents of PEPT1 and PEPT2 expressed in  Xenopus laevis oocytes were recorded by the two-electrode voltage-clamp  technique. Statistically significant, but very low currents were only observed  for lisinopril, enalapril, quinapril, and benazepril at PEPT1 and for spirapril  at PEPT2. For the other ACE inhibitors, electrogenic transport activity was  extremely low or not measurable at all.

To obtain the area of  knowledge, the design of experiments studying the effect of two components (HPMC  K15M and ethylcellulose) at different levels has been applied, with the captopril  dissolution profile as the product's most important critical quality attribute  (CQA). Different dissolution profiles have been obtained with the design of  experiments performed, which is a key factor in the development of controlled  release matrix tablets. Kinetic analysis according to the equations of Higuchi  and Korsmeyer-Peppas demonstrates that the release mechanism is a mechanism of  erosion when the whole percentage of the polymer is ethylcellulose, and a  diffusion mechanism when the whole percentage of the polymer is HPMC K15M. The  physico-chemical characteristics of the gel layer determine the release rate of  captopril. The thickness of the gel layer, the porosity which is formed in the  matrix upon contact with water, pore size, the swelling rate, the erosion rate of  the matrix, and the physico-chemical characteristics of captopril, are factors  related to the kinetic equations described and that allow us to predict the  release mechanism of captopril. A new relationship of the kinetic equations  governing the in vitro behavior with the physical characteristics of the gel  layer of the different formulations has been established. This study shows that  the size of water-filled pores and the degree of crosslinking between the chains  of HPMC K15M of the matrix are related to the exponent n of the Korsmeyer-Peppas  equation and the type of transport of the captopril from within the matrix to the  dissolution medium, that is, if the transport is only through water-filled pores,  or if a combination of diffusion occurs through water-filled pores with a  transport through continuous polymeric networks.","2014-12-30","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","431-441","","1-2","477","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The application of these methods  to live animals permits direct observation of acute physical responses that lack  chemically detectable signals in the blood or urine and would otherwise remain  unknown. With the use of special fluorescent dyes, chemical/hormonal responses  may also be detected. The delivery and site-specific effects of drugs can be  monitored in real-time. The capacity to simultaneously visualize both proximal  and distal segments of the nephron permits observation of the dynamic processes  within the living kidney and a quantitative assessment of the various operations.  Consequently, a clinically valuable and pending application for multi-photon  microscopy will be to provide real-time, quantitative imaging of basic organ  functions and their responses to therapeutic intervention. Imaging of the  intra-renal renin content and enzymatic activity of renin in situ and in  real-time is a new, more informative measure of RAS activity. Direct  visualization of the molecular and cellular components of renin release signals  and the interactions between the vascular endothelium, tubular epithelium, local  mediators, and the renin producing cells provides great insight for drug  development. Examples of how the effects of various RAS inhibitors can be  visualized in the intact kidney are provided: including angiotensin converting  enzyme inhibition (captopril), angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade  (olmesartan), and renin inhibition (aliskiren).

It is largely unknown where Ang II is  produced in the kidney and how much of it originates from the circulation.  METHODS: The concentrations of endogenous and 125I-labeled Ang I and II were  measured in renal tissue and in blood from pigs receiving systemic infusions of  125I-Ang I. Pigs were either untreated or treated with the angiotensin converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril or the AT1 receptor antagonist eprosartan.  RESULTS: 125I-Ang I was undetectable in renal tissue but the steady-state  concentrations of 125I-Ang II in cortical and medullary tissue were four and two  times the concentration in arterial blood plasma, respectively. The tissue  concentrations of endogenous Ang II were 100 and 60 times higher than in arterial  plasma. Eprosartan reduced 125I-Ang II accumulation by 90%, but did not lower  tissue Ang II. Captopril did not alter either 125I-Ang II accumulation or tissue  Ang II. CONCLUSIONS: The bulk of Ang II in the kidney is cell-associated. The  high tissue/blood concentration ratio of endogenous Ang II may depend on the same  mechanism as demonstrated for 125I-Ang II, that is, AT1 receptor-mediated binding  to cells and endocytosis. If so, the results indicate that most renal AT1  receptors are exposed to locally generated Ang II rather than Ang II from the  circulation. We propose the existence of a low-Ang II vascular system-related  interstitial compartment that is separate from tubular fluid, where, according to  micropuncture studies, Ang II levels might be high.","2001-12","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","2311-2317","","6","60","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11737604","","","","Animals; Tissue Distribution; Swine; Imidazoles/pharmacology; Kidney/cytology/*metabolism; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Captopril/pharmacology; *Thiophenes; Acrylates/pharmacology; Angiotensin II/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Epidermis obtained by suction blister technique  incubated with human polymorphonuclear cells, resulted in a 54% increase in LTB4  formation when compared to polymorphonuclear cells incubated alone. Furthermore,  human epidermis transformed exogenous LTA4 into LTB4, and this reaction obeyed  Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 6 microM. Subcellular  fractionation of homogenized epidermis localized the LTA4-hydrolase activity  mainly in the 105,000 x g supernatant fraction (cytoplasmic fraction). This  activity was inhibited by two inhibitors of LTA4-hydrolase (bestatin and  captopril). Western blot analysis of the 105,000 x g fraction of homogenized  epidermis and cultured keratinocytes supported the presence of a LTA4-hydrolase.  Thus, normal human epidermis possesses LTA4-hydrolase activity which can  transform exogenous LTA4 and polymorphonuclear cell-derived LTA4 into LTB4. The  identification of LTA4-hydrolase in the cytoplasmic fraction of human epidermis  indicates that epidermal cells may play a more active role in the enzymatic  process leading to formation of the proinflammatory compound LTB4 than previously  expected.","1994-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","191-201","","3","7","","J Dermatol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 7918238","","","","Humans; Tissue Distribution; Blotting, Western; Peroxidase/metabolism; Neutrophils/metabolism; Calcimycin/pharmacology; Epidermis/*metabolism; Epoxide Hydrolases/*metabolism; Keratinocytes/metabolism; Leukotriene A4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Leukotriene B4/metabolism; Subcellular Fractions/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blood samples were taken  from the aorta and the renal, antecubital, femoral, and hepatic veins.  [125I]Angiotensin I and angiotensin I were extracted from plasma, separated by  high-performance liquid chromatography, and quantitated by gamma counting and  radioimmunoassay. Plasma renin activity was measured at pH 7.4. The plasma decay  curves after discontinuation of the infusions of [125I]angiotensin I and  unlabeled angiotensin I were similar for the two peptides. The regional  extraction ratio of [125I]angiotensin I was 47 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) across the  forearm, 59 +/- 3% across the leg, 81 +/- 1% across the kidneys, and 96 +/- 1%  across the hepatomesenteric vascular bed. These results were not different from  those obtained for infused unlabeled angiotensin I. Despite the rapid removal of  arterially delivered angiotensin I, no difference was found between the venous  and arterial levels of endogenous angiotensin I across the various vascular beds,  with the exception of the liver where angiotensin I in the vein was 50% lower  than in the aorta. Thus, 50-90% of endogenous angiotensin I in the veins appeared  to be derived from regional de novo production. The blood transit time is 0.1-0.2  minute in the limbs and in the kidneys and 0.3-0.5 minute in the hepatomesenteric  vascular bed. This is too short for plasma renin activity to account for the  measured de novo angiotensin I production. It was calculated that less than  20-30% in the limbs and in the kidneys and approximately 60% in the  hepatomesenteric region of de novo-produced angiotensin I could be accounted for  by circulating renin. These results indicate that a high percentage of plasma  angiotensin I may be produced locally (i.e., not in circulating plasma).","1990-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","44-55","","1","15","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2403979","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Tissue Distribution; Hypertension/*blood; Renin/blood; Angiotensin I/biosynthesis/*blood/metabolism; Angiotensin II/blood/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with baseline,  fosinopril decreased TxB2 concentrations 27.5-67.6% with all stimuli after 1 and  5 min. Captopril also decreased TxB2 formation, but this effect was stimulus and  time dependent. Enalapril consistently increased TxB2 concentrations, independent  of stimuli or time. We conclude that different ACE inhibitors have distinct  effects on platelet TxB2 formation without significant effects on platelet  aggregation. Fosinopril may be a direct antagonist ofTxA2 synthase, suggesting  benefit in syndromes of platelet activation or vascular occlusion.","1997-10","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","461-467","","4","30","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9335405","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Area Under Curve; Hypertension/*blood/drug therapy; Platelet Aggregation/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Blood Platelets/*drug effects/physiology; Thromboxane B2/antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nitration of free tyrosine and tyrosine residues of  proteins results in production of nitrotyrosine, which can lead to excitotoxicity  and frequently is found in the brain of patients and animals with various  degenerative, ischemic, toxic, and other neurologic disorders. According to  earlier studies, reactive oxygen species activity is increased and neuronal NO  synthase expression in the brain is elevated in animals with chronic renal  failure (CRF). It was hypothesized, therefore, that tyrosine nitration must be  increased in the uremic brain. This hypothesis was tested, through determination  of nitrotyrosine abundance (by Western blot analysis), as well as distribution  (by immunohistology), in the cerebrum of rats with CRF 6 wk after 5/6  nephrectomy. The results were compared with those of sham-operated controls and  antioxidant (lazaroid)-treated and captopril-treated rats with CRF. Western blot  analysis revealed a significant increase in nitrotyrosine abundance in the  cerebral cortex of rats with CRF. This was accompanied by an intense  nitrotyrosine staining of the neuronal processes, including proximal segments of  dendrites, axons, and axon terminals of the cortical neurons. Both antioxidant  therapy and captopril administration alleviated oxidative stress (as evidenced by  normalization of plasma lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde) and  significantly reduced nitrotyrosine abundance in the cerebral cortex of the  treated CRF group. In conclusion, CRF resulted in oxidative stress and increased  tyrosine nitration in the cerebral cortex. Antioxidant therapy and  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition alleviated the CRF-induced oxidative  stress and mitigated tyrosine nitration in the rats with CRF.","2001-09","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1892-1899","","9","12","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11518782","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tissue Distribution; Blotting, Western; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Captopril/*therapeutic use; Antioxidants/*therapeutic use; Brain/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology; Pregnatrienes/*therapeutic use; Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The  formulations containing edetate disodium, syrup, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate,  sodium metabisulphite were less stable than those in which the only vehicle was  distilled chemically pure water. The change of pH did not improve the formulation  stability. The samples stored at 4 degrees C were much more stable than those  stored at 25 degrees C, and the microbiological quality was much better.  CONCLUSIONS: Captopril, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, made with distilled  chemically pure water stored in PVC plastic container and protected from light,  was stable for 30 days at 4 degrees C.","2005-02","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","30-36","","1","29","","Farm Hosp","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 15773800","","","","Captopril/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SCH 33844 diacid inhibited hydrolysis of hip-his-leu by  rabbit lung ACE in a potent (Ki = 0.74 nM), selective, and noncompetitive  fashion. SCH 33844 (0.03-1 mg/kg p.o.) produced dose-related inhibition of  angiotensin I (AI) pressor responses in conscious rats with a duration of 24 h at  the higher dose. SCH 33844 (0.3-30 mg/kg p.o.) reduced blood pressure in a  dose-related manner in conscious SHR with a 24-h duration. Antihypertensive  activity was enhanced in the presence of hydrochlorothiazide. The drug (1-10  mg/kg p.o.) also lowered blood pressure in conscious hydrochlorothiazide-treated  normotensive dogs. In anesthetized dogs, SCH 33844 (1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced blood  pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance and slightly increased cardiac  output and stroke volume. These results suggest that peripheral vasodilation is  the primary mechanism of the antihypertensive action. The metabolic profile of  SCH 33844 was evaluated in dogs and rats. The compound was absorbed in a  dose-proportional manner and excreted primarily as the diacid form. In contrast  to captopril and enalapril, most of the drug (67%) was excreted into the feces  following i.v. dosing.

Previous studies in B(2)R gene knockout mice showed that  the B(1)R is overexpressed, is further upregulated by hypertensive maneuvers, and  assumes some of the hemodynamic functions of the B(2)R. The current experiments  were designed to further clarify the metabolic function of the B(2)R and to  explore whether the upregulated B(1)R can also assume the metabolic function of  the missing B(2)R. One group of B(2)R-/- mice (n=9) and one of B(2)R+/+ controls  (n=8) were treated for 3 days with captopril (which produced a similar blood  pressure-lowering response in both groups) and studied with the hyperinsulinemic  euglycemic clamp. The knockout mice had fasting and steady-state blood glucose  levels similar to those of the wild-type mice but a had tendency to higher  fasting insulin levels (at 27.8+/-5.2 versus 18+/-2.9 mU/L, respectively).  However, they had significantly higher steady-state insulin levels (749+/-127.2  versus 429.1+/-31.5 mU/L, P<0.05) and a significantly lower glucose uptake rate  (31+/-2.4 versus 41+/-2.3 mg/kg per minute, P<0.05) and insulin sensitivity index  (4.6+/-0.9 versus 10+/-0.7 P<0.001). Analysis of B(1)R and B(2)R gene expression  by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in cardiac muscle, skeletal  muscle, and adipose tissues revealed significantly higher B(1)R mRNA level in the  knockouts versus wild-type (P<0.05) at baseline and a further significant  upregulation in mRNA by 1.8- to 3.2-fold (P<0.05) after insulin infusion. We  conclude that absence of B(2)R confers a state of insulin resistance because it  results in impaired insulin-dependent glucose transport; this is probably a  direct B(2)R effect because, unlike the hemodynamic autacoid-mediated effects, it  cannot be assumed by the upregulated B(1)R.","2001-12-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1355-1360","","6","38","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11751717","","","","Animals; Mice; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Glucose Clamp Technique; Insulin Resistance/*physiology; Up-Regulation; RNA, Messenger/analysis; Glucose/pharmacokinetics; Mice, Knockout; Captopril/pharmacology; Receptor, Bradykinin B2; Receptors, Bradykinin/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

S3 is identical to cytochrome  P450 IV A2. SA encoded a protein of 546 amino acid residues, and its carboxyl  terminal region had a slight homology to luciferase. No homologous sequence has  been reported in S2 sequences. S3 mRNA was about four times more abundantly  expressed in the kidneys of 28-day-old SHR than in those of age-matched WKY rats,  but there was no difference at age 16 weeks. A low NaCl diet positively modulated  the expression of the S3 gene. S2 mRNA was almost undetectable in the kidneys of  28-day-old WKY rats but was clearly detected in those of age-matched SHR. The  expression level of S2 mRNA in the livers of 16-week-old SHR was about five times  higher than that of age-matched WKY rats. The expression of S2 mRNA in the livers  was modulated by dietary NaCl and captopril. SA mRNA was more than 10 times more  abundantly expressed in the kidneys of SHR than in those of WKY rats from age 4  weeks. With the administration of captopril, the expressions of SA mRNA in the  livers of SHR were positively modulated. Because these three genes are not only  differentially expressed between SHR and WKY rats but also related to sodium  metabolism or blood pressure control, the identification of these genes may  provide important probes to examine the mechanisms of hypertension.","1991-02","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","161-169","","2","17","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1991648","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Amino Acid Sequence; Tissue Distribution; *Gene Expression Regulation; Blotting, Southern; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Kidney/*physiopathology; DNA/metabolism; Rats, Inbred WKY; Rats, Inbred SHR; Hypertension/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats were dialyzed for 240 minutes with 30 mL 4.25%  glucose dialysate containing dextran 70. An angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitor (captopril), three calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, diltiazem,  and verapamil), and an +/-blocker (maxisylite) were administered  intraperitoneally at various concentrations. Membrane permeability to urea,  glucose, and protein, actual net ultrafiltration rate (UFR), transcapillary  ultrafiltration rate (TCUFR), and peritoneal net fluid absorption rate (PNFAR)  were measured. All three vasodilators caused a decrease in blood pressure, which,  except for moxisylite, was associated with a decrease in net UFR. Captopril and  the three calcium antagonists increased PNFAR dose dependently. Captopril  increased membrane permeability to small and large molecular solutes, with a  consequent decrease in TCUFR. Nicardipine and verapamil increased permeability to  urea and glucose but not to protein. Only the latter decreased TCUFR. Diltiazem  caused no change in permeability. In conclusion, various vasodilators  administered intraperitoneally affect peritoneal solute and fluid transport  differently.

There is  substantial evidence that the proximal tubule (PT) is a primary target site for  captopril but the molecular mechanisms for its action in PT are not well defined.  The aim of this study was to determine the physiological and molecular changes in  PT provoked by acute captopril treatment in the absence of changes in blood  pressure or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Captopril (infused at 12 microg/min  for 20 min) did not change blood pressure or GFR but induced an immediate (<10  min) increase in PT flow measured with a nonobstructive optical method (to 117  +/- 14% of baseline) along with a rapid diuresis from 2.1 +/- 0.6 mg/min  (baseline) to 3.7 +/- 0.9 mg/min (captopril). Captopril also provoked a  significant retraction of PT Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), NHE  regulatory factor (NHERF)-1, myosin-VI, and Na(+)-P(i) cotransporter type 2  (NaPi2), but not ACE, out of apical microvillus-enriched membranes. Proteomic  analysis with MALDI-TOF MS revealed an additional eight abundant  membrane-associated proteins that redistributed out of the microvillus-enriched  membrane during captopril treatment: megalin, myosin II-A, clathrin,  aminopeptidase N, DPPIV, ezrin, moesin, and vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit beta(2).  In summary, captopril can rapidly depress PT reabsorption in the absence of a  change in GFR or BP and provokes the redistribution of a set of transporters and  transporter-associated proteins that likely participate in the decrease in PT  reabsorption and may also contribute to the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE  inhibitors.","2006-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","F854-863","","4","290","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16263808","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Mass Spectrometry; Proteomics; Blood Pressure; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Captopril/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Sodium/*pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*physiology; Membrane Proteins/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isometric tension  recordings were used to assess inhibitory effects of homocysteine and protective  effects of captopril on endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings.  Exposure of aortic rings to homocysteine (0.3 approximately 3 mmol/L) for 30 min  induced a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of endothelium-dependent  relaxation response to acetylcholine (ACh), but did not affect  endothelium-independent relaxation response to sodium nitroprusside.  Pre-incubation of aortic rings with captopril (3 approximately 30 micromol/L) for  15 min and co-incubation of aortic rings with homocysteine (1 mmol/L) for another  30 min attenuated the inhibition of homocysteine in a dose-dependent manner.  Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD, 200 U/mL), a scavenger of superoxide anions,  reduced homocysteine-induced inhibition. L-Arginine (3 mmol/L), a precursor of  nitric oxide (NO), also attenuated the impairment of vasorelaxation induced by  homocysteine. However, in the combined presence of SOD and L-arginine, the  inhibitory effect of homocysteine was reversed, which was very similar to the  effect of 30 micromol/L captopril. These results suggest that captopril can  prevent the inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by  homocysteine in isolated rat aorta, which may be related to scavenging oxygen  free radicals and enhancing NO production.","2003-10","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","566-572","","4","42","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14508244","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/physiopathology; Vasodilation/drug effects; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects; Captopril/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Acetylcholine/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Aorta, Thoracic/*drug effects/physiopathology; Arginine/pharmacokinetics; Homocysteine/*adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Muscle Relaxation/*drug effects/physiology; Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in humans. SUBJECTS AND  METHODS: We examined the effects of captopril, 25 mg three times a day, or  matched placebo for 7 days on sympathetic activity during a 10 mEq/day sodium  diet in seven healthy male subjects aged 30 +/- 3 (SEM) years. A tritiated  norepinephrine radioisotope dilution technique was used to measure sympathetic  activity, both at rest and during isometric handgrip exercise. RESULTS: Captopril  blunted the increase in mean arterial pressure during isometric handgrip exercise  (placebo, from 81 +/- 4 to 112 +/- 2 mm Hg; captopril, from 78 +/- 3 to 101 +/- 2  mm Hg; p < 0.01). However, the increase in systemic norepinephrine spillover  during isometric handgrip exercise was not blunted by captopril. Captopril had no  effect on resting mean arterial pressure or systemic norepinephrine spillover.  CONCLUSIONS: Captopril did not attenuate baseline or static exercise-stimulated  sympathetic activity in healthy subjects. These findings would indicate that  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition does not decrease sympathetic activity  at rest or during the stimulus of isometric handgrip exercise.","1996-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","668-674","","6","59","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8681492","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Double-Blind Method; Heart Rate/drug effects; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Exercise; Captopril/*pharmacology; Rest; Radioisotope Dilution Technique; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Renin/blood; Norepinephrine/*blood/pharmacokinetics; Sympathetic Nervous System/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Substance P is degraded by the peptidases neutral  endopeptidase-24.11 (NEP-24.11) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In the  present study, we used capsaicin to produce neurogenic inflammation in the nasal  mucosa of rats, and we examined the effect of inhibition of NEP-24.11 by  phosphoramidon, inhibition of ACE by captopril or inhibition of both enzymes by  giving both inhibitors. Using as tracers intravenous Evans blue dye to quantify  the extravasation and Monastral blue pigment to localize the sites of leakage, we  examined the magnitude and distribution of capsaicin-induced plasma extravasation  in the nasoturbinates, maxilloturbinates, ethmoidal turbinates and septum.  Capsaicin caused a dose-dependent increase in Evans blue extravasation in the  naso- and maxilloturbinates but had only a slight effect in the septum. The leaky  blood vessels responsible for this plasma extravasation, as manifested by  Monastral blue labeling, were most numerous in the naso- and maxilloturbinates,  particularly near the front and free borders. After phosphoramidon, the leakage  of Monastral blue was more widespread and extended in a more caudal direction.  The response to capsaicin was augmented by phosphoramidon alone but not by  captopril alone. However, in the presence of phosphoramidon, captopril further  augmented the capsaicin-induced extravasation.

Renal artery flow reduction of approximately 70% decreased  the extraction fraction of all three agents (P < or = .05). Captopril had no  effect on extraction fraction in controls, but it produced a further decrease in  extraction fraction of 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine and  [131I]orthoiodohippurate in rats with renal artery stenosis (P < or = .05).  Ischemia resulted in a 16% decrease in flow (P < .01) but a much larger (47% to  65%) decrease in extraction fraction of all three agents (P < .002). Partial  renal vein occlusion also decreased the extraction fraction of all three agents  (P < or = .05). The changes in extraction fraction imply that the clearances of  [131I]orthoiodohippurate and 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine in disease states may  not be proportional to renal plasma flow. Furthermore, in rats with renal artery  stenosis it appears that renal blood flow must fall below a critical threshold of  approximately 58% before extraction fraction decreases; as renal blood flow is  further reduced below this threshold, there is a corresponding reduction in  extraction fraction (P < .01).","1994-01","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","96-103","","1","23","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8282336","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Ischemia/*physiopathology; Kidney/*blood supply/metabolism; *Renal Circulation; Captopril/pharmacology; Iodohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Renal Artery Obstruction/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The microstructure and chemical  change of membranes hydrated for 0, 5, 10 and 30min were measured using SR-FTIR,  combined with scanning electronic microscopy and atom force microscopy. The  SR-FTIR microspectroscopy results indicated that there was a major change at the  absorption range of 2700-3100cm(-1) in the membranes after different periods of  hydration time. The absorption bands at 2870-2880cm(-1) and 2950-2960cm(-1) were  assigned to represent CA and PEG, respectively. The chemical group signal  distribution illustrated by the ratio of PEG to CA demonstrated that the trigger  of drug release in the preliminary stage was due to the rapid transfer of PEG  into liquid medium with a sharp decrease of PEG in the membranes.

Expression of colonic and ileal NHE-3 isoform, its  regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) and cyclic GMP kinase II (cGKII) were examined  using western blot analysis. Since NHE-3 activity is regulated by its abundance  on the plasma membrane, its levels were also examined in lipid rafts-enriched  membrane fractions. The lipid rafts fractions were characterized by examining the  concentration of flotillin-1 and caveolin-1, total protein, and cholesterol.  Twelve-weeks-old SHR used in this study developed significant hypertension,  proteinuria, and renal and cardiac hypertrophy. These changes were significantly  reversed by captopril treatment. There was a significant decrease in the levels  of NHE-3 and NHERF-1 proteins, and sodium pump activity, but an increase in the  cGKII levels in both tissues from SHR. Reduction in NHERF-1 levels was reversed  by captopril but not of the other proteins. Cholesterol profile was significantly  different in SHR colon as compared to normo-tensive Wistar Kyoto rats. These  findings suggest that suppression of NHE-3 in intestine is a counteracting  mechanism of hypertension and is regulated by NHERF-1 through cGKII activation in  SHR. NHE-3 suppression together with decrease in the sodium pump activity would  accumulate intracellular Na(+) and may contribute to the reported  hypertension-induced tissue damage in the GI-tract.","2013","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","543-549","","7","35","","Clin Exp Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23402556","","","","Animals; Rats; Tissue Distribution; Membrane Proteins/metabolism; Blood Pressure/physiology; Carrier Proteins/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Phosphoproteins/metabolism; Rats, Inbred WKY; Captopril/pharmacology; Rats, Inbred SHR; Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism; Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 3; Caveolin 1/metabolism; Colon/physiopathology; Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II/metabolism; Hypertension/drug therapy/*etiology/*physiopathology; Ileum/physiopathology; Intestines/*physiopathology; Membrane Microdomains/metabolism; Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perindopril is a third generation converting enzyme inhibitor that produces  profound and prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (24 h after  a single dose).

ACEI failed to significantly increase plasma renin  activity, renal renin mRNA expression, and renal renin activity in (-/-) mice.  ACEI increased the number of cells expressing immunoreactive renin in the (+/+)  mice both by inducing more juxtaglomerular cells to express immunoreactive renin  and by recruiting additional renin-expressing cells in the more proximal afferent  arteriole. In contrast, there was minimal recruitment of renin-expressing cells  in the more proximal afferent arteriole of the -/- mice.

This agent is a  prodrug to improve intestinal absorption of TBPM, an active form, and an  absorption rate of TBPM-PI is higher than those of other prodrug-type β-lactam  antibiotics. In the present study, we hypothesized that a certain mechanism other  than simple diffusion is involved in the process of improved intestinal  absorption of TBPM-PI and examined the mechanism. TBPM-PI uptake by Caco-2 cells  was decreased by ATP-depletion and lowering the temperature to 4 °C, suggesting  the contribution of carrier-mediated transport mechanisms. This uptake was  partially decreased by ACE inhibitors, and the reduction of the absorption by  captopril was observed by in vivo study and in situ single-pass intestinal  perfusion study in rat, supporting the contribution of influx transporters. Since  some ACE inhibitors and β-lactam antibiotics are reported to be substrates of  PEPT and OATP families, we measured transporting activity of TBPM-PI by  intestinally expressed transporters, PEPT1, OATP1A2, and OATP2B1. As a result,  significant transport activities were observed by both OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 but  not by PEPT1. Interestingly, pH dependence of TBPM-PI transports was different  between OATP1A2 and OATP2B1, showing highest activity by OATP1A2 at pH 6.5, while  OATP2B1-mediated uptake was higher at neutral and weak alkaline pH. OATP1A2  exhibited higher affinity for TBPM-PI (K(m) = 41.1 μM) than OATP2B1 (K(m) > 1 mM)  for this agent. These results suggested that TBPM-PI has high intestinal apical  membrane permeability due to plural intestinal transport routes, including the  uptake transporters such as OATP1A2 and OATP2B1 as well as simple diffusion.","2010-10-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1747-1756","","5","7","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20735088","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Administration, Oral; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Biological Transport, Active; Caco-2 Cells; Oocytes/metabolism; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects/*physiology; Xenopus; Organic Anion Transporters/*metabolism; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Captopril/pharmacology; Peptide Transporter 1; Symporters/metabolism; Carbapenems/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been suggested that C-terminal amidation of enkephalins  enhances their resistance to dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I-mediated  biodegradation. In this study, a novel [Met5]enkephalin amide (MEA) analogue  [Met5]enkephalin (ME)-semicarbazide synthesized by another laboratory in our  group was assessed for its antinociceptive effects compared with ME-ethylamide,  MEA and ME, using tail flick test. To protect the administered drugs from  biodegradation, rats were pretreated with peptidase inhibitors including  amastatin, phosphoramidon and captopril. Then captopril (dipeptidyl  carboxypeptidase-I inhibitor) was deleted from the peptidase inhibitors'  combination for evaluating in vivo resistance of the synthetic drugs to  dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I. According to the results, ME-semicarbazide and MEA  were resistant enough to dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I to exert their strong  antinociception following intrathecal administration even in the absence of  captopril, whereas the antinociceptive effects produced by ME-ethylamide  (10 nmol) were abolished in rats not pretreated with captopril, indicating that  significant amounts of the ME-ethylamide were degraded by dipeptidyl  carboxypeptidase-I. Replacement of the amide moiety of MEA with semicarbazide  provides a new ME derivative, with high analgesic effects as well as more  resistance to dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase-I-mediated biodegradation.","2012-02","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","92-96","","2","18","","J Pept Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22083687","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Biotransformation; Rats, Wistar; Hydrolysis; Injections, Spinal; Peptides/pharmacology; Nociception/drug effects; Captopril/pharmacology; Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology; Glycopeptides/pharmacology; Analgesics/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology; Carboxypeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Enkephalin, Methionine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Semicarbazides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High pressure liquid  chromatography (HPLC) with different mobile phases combined with specific  radioimmunoassays (RIA) proved to be a powerful tool for peptide characterization  in biological samples; (Ile5)-ANG I, (Ile5)-ANG II and (Ile5)-ANG III could  clearly be identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), incubated in vivo and in  vitro with renin, in total brain extracts, as well as in hypothalamus (HT),  medulla oblongata (MO), cerebellum (CER) and cortex (CO). Angiotensin cleaved  from CSF angiotensinogen and angiotensin extracted from brain showed retention  times identical to those of plasma angiotensin and synthetic standard peptides,  indicating that their amino acid sequence is probably identical. ANG I and ANG II  were highest in the HT and lowest in the CO. Following bilateral nephrectomy (NX)  both ANG I and ANG II persisted at control levels. Young 10 week old  spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) showed significantly lower ANG I and ANG  II concentrations in the HT compared with Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY).  Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the converting enzyme  inhibitor captopril caused a significant increase in ANG 1 in nephrectomized  SHRSP but not in WKY. These differences were not found in 40 week old SHRSP. The  data show that ANG I and ANG II are synthetized in the brain of rats. The lower  concentrations and the enhanced accumulation of ANG I after converting enzyme  blockade in nephrectomized young SHRSP indicate an increased turnover of  angiotensin in hypertensive rats.","1984","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","471-480","","6","79","","J Physiol (Paris)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 6100310","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Tissue Distribution; Brain/*metabolism; Nephrectomy; Rats, Inbred WKY; Hypertension/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Captopril/pharmacology; Rats, Inbred SHR; Angiotensin I/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification; Angiotensin II/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification; Angiotensin III/isolation & purification; Angiotensins/*biosynthesis/cerebrospinal fluid; Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endothelial-dependent relaxation  was increased in both CAP and EX rats relative to the control group. Maximal  aortic relaxations were enhanced in the CAP group, and potencies of these  mediators were enhanced in the EX group (P < 0.05 versus control). Combined  treatment did not result in a synergistic effect. NOS3 relative expressions were:  group 1, 100%; group 2, 241%; group 3, 64%; and group 4, 108%. Exercise enhanced  both potencies and efficacies of the mediators studied, whereas CAP increased  mainly their efficacies.

Production of the precursor protein, angiotensinogen,  is regulated by other components within the RAS. Angiotensin II (Ang II)  stimulates the production and secretion of angiotensinogen in many mammalian  models. However, the existence of a similar positive feedback mechanism for  angiotensinogen has not been demonstrated for any non-mammalian species. In the  present study, we have cloned the angiotensinogen for silver sea bream (Sparus  sarba) and investigated the role of Ang II on angiotensinogen expression. The  nucleotide sequence of angiotensinogen for S. sarba only exhibits a fair  resemblance to other fish angiotensinogens and shows 76.6% similarity to that of  Takifugu rubripes and 57.2% similarity to that of Danio rerio. Angiotensinogen  transcripts have been identified in the brain, liver, kidney, and various parts  of the intestine of sea bream, an observation, which probably implies the  presence of a local RAS at the tissue level. The liver is probably the major  source of angiotensinogen, as it exhibits the highest angiotensinogen transcript  abundance among different tissues. Differential angiotensinogen expression was  found among different regions of the intestine where the pyloric caeca exhibits  the highest expression. Putative Ang I is identified at the N-terminal of the  deduced protein with a novel sequence [Asn1, Ile5, His9]-Ang I. Hepatic  angiotensinogen expression in sea bream adapted to different salinities remained  constant and this is probably due to desensitization of the angiotensin receptors  by angiotensin. A positive feedback mechanism of angiotensinogen by Ang II has  been demonstrated as exogenous Ang II increased the amount of angiotensinogen  transcript in isolated hepatocytes in vitro. Blockade of endogenous RAS by the  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, significantly lowered  the hepatic expression of angiotensinogen in vivo. The effect of Ang II  stimulation on angiotensinogen expression is more potent in fish than that in  mammals. These data suggest that the positive feedback mechanism of  angiotensinogen by Ang II has already evolved in teleosts and such mechanism may  be involved in the maintenance of angiotensinogen secretion under resting and  hypertensive conditions.","2007-01-15","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","103-111","","1-2","263","","Mol Cell Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 17027145","","","","Animals; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Amino Acid Sequence; Tissue Distribution; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Cloning, Molecular; Phylogeny; Liver/cytology/*metabolism; RNA, Messenger/*metabolism; Captopril/pharmacology; Renin-Angiotensin System; *Feedback, Physiological; Angiotensinogen/genetics/*metabolism; Sea Bream","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, there is a great need to exploit effective treatment strategies, and the  carrier-drug approach is an attractive method to improve the kidney specificity  of the therapeutic agents. The aim of this present study is to develop a  peptide-drug conjugate for the kidney targeted delivery of angiotensin-converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (CAP), since G3-C12 peptide (ANTPCGPYTHDCPVKR)  could specifically accumulate in the kidney after intravenous injection.  Therefore, FITC labeled G3-C12 peptide (G3-C12-FITC) and peptide-drug conjugate  (G3-C12-CAP) with a disulfide bond which can be cleaved by reduced glutathione in  the kidney were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The fluorescence  imaging of G3-C12-FITC revealed that the labeled peptide specifically accumulated  in the kidney soon after i.v. injection to mice, and the accumulation is due  largely to the reabsorption of the peptide by the proximal renal tubule cells.  Furthermore, in comparison with the corresponding nonconjugated form, a 2.7-fold  increase in renal area under concentration-time curve produced by the conjugate  was observed in mice. Interestingly, the CAP entirely released in the kidney even  at 0.05 h postinjection through disulfide reduction. As a consequence, the in  vivo renal ACE inhibition was significantly increased. In conclusion, these  findings suggest the potential of G3-C12 peptide serving as a suitable candidate  carrier for kidney-targeted drug delivery.","2012-06-20","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1200-1210","","6","23","","Bioconjug Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22663297","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Amino Acid Sequence; Kidney/*metabolism; *Drug Delivery Systems; Captopril/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Disulfides/*chemistry/metabolism; Drug Carriers/chemistry/metabolism; Peptides/*chemistry/metabolism; Solid-Phase Synthesis Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicate that the majority of Phe-Pro  was hydrolyzed during passage from the apical (AP) to basolateral (BL) side. The  enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis is prolidase, a cytosolic enzyme. Through  kinetic studies of a supernatant enzyme preparation, a Km of 30.4 microM and Vmax  of 38.9 nmol/min per mg of protein were obtained. The enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis  was inhibited by proline (66%), Zn+ (86%), Cu++ (100%), Fe (100%), PCMB (89%),  and captopril (66%), but not by leucine. We also studied the transcellular  transport of Phe-Pro by measuring the amount of Phe in the receiver media. In the  presence of a proton gradient (AP pH6, BL pH7.4), the appearance rate of Phe in  the BL media after Phe-Pro was loaded apically was at least 100 times faster than  that in the AP media after Phe-Pro was loaded basolaterally. The former is also  higher than the appearance rate of Phe without a transepithelial proton gradient  (pH 6-pH 6) or against a proton gradient (pH7.4-pH6). The rate of appearance of  Phe in the BL media (pH7.4) after Phe-Pro was loaded on the AP side (pH 6) was  decreased by the presence in the AP media of proline (42%), leucine (40%), and  captopril (17%), but not by Zn++.

To understand molecular mechanisms underlying this  electrical abnormality, expression of cardiac voltage-gated K+ channel subunit  genes was examined in ventricles of renovascular hypertensive rats. While  generating a rat Kv4.3 probe, we discovered a previously unreported 19-amino acid  insertion in the C-terminal intracellular region of the channel subunit. RNase  protection assays indicated that this novel isoform is predominant in rat lung  and heart. Effects of renovascular hypertension were then determined by using  renal artery clipping models: two-kidney, one clip (2K-1C) rats, a model of  high-renin hypertension with a normal plasma volume, and one-kidney, one clip  (1K-1C) rats, a model of normal renin with a raised plasma volume. Expression of  Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 mRNAs was diminished by > 50% in ventricles of 2K-1C rats;  however, no changes in the expression of Kv1.2, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, or KvLQT1  mRNAs were detected. Similar downregulation of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 mRNAs was detected  in 1K-1C rats. Chronic administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitor, blocked the development of hypertension and the suppression of  Kv4 subfamily channel mRNA expression in 2K-1C rats.

These  results indicate that renovascular hypertension causes specific reductions in Kv4  subfamily channel mRNA expression and that this effect is likely to be mediated  primarily by an increase in cardiac afterload.","1997-10","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","533-539","","4","81","","Circ Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9314834","","","","Male; Genetic Variation; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Molecular Sequence Data; Tissue Distribution; Myocardium/*metabolism; Heart Ventricles; RNA, Messenger/*metabolism; Alternative Splicing; Hypertension, Renovascular/*metabolism; *Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated; Potassium Channels/genetics; Shal Potassium Channels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a given  transepithelial flux of methionine, i.e., a constant amount of methionine  recovered in the serosal chamber, a greater enterocyte incorporation was  detected. Cp-HTZ treatment corrected the diet-induced methionine trapping in  intestinal epithelia but had little effect in control animals. In separate in  vitro experiments, Cp added alone significantly activated methionine fluxes in  epithelia from metcas-fed miniature pigs as it did in vivo, demonstrating that Cp  rather than HTZ mainly contributed to the in vivo effects of the drug  combination. Our results showed that the regulation of intestinal methionine  absorption compensated the diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and that Cp-HTZ  treatment altered these adaptative changes without increasing methioninemia and  homocysteinemia.","1995-12","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","3011-3019","","12","125","","J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7500179","","","","Male; Animals; Tritium; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Disease Models, Animal; Random Allocation; Swine; Homocysteine/blood; Diuretics; Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects/physiology; Swine, Miniature; Jejunum/metabolism; Captopril/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Epithelium/metabolism; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/pharmacology; Caseins/*pharmacology; Methionine/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This apparent tissue selectivity may stem from  either differences in tissue bioavailability or from a different affinity for the  enzyme. The affinity of the ACE inhibitor for a particular enzyme is not only  determined by the structure of the inhibitor, but also by the structure of the  enzyme. ACE enzymes from different tissues may be slightly different, and this  may have some bearing on the relative affinities of different ACE inhibitors for  ACE from different tissues. The duration of inhibition in a particular tissue  reflects not only the affinity of that inhibitor for the tissue enzyme, but also  reflects the ease or difficulty with which the active ACE inhibitor is released  from that tissue. Whether the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on  experimentally induced myocardial infarction and reperfusion arrhythmias are due  to the presence of a sulfhydryl group or are mainly related to the ACE  inhibitor-mediated bradykinin potentiation remains a matter of controversy.","1992-10-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","102C-108C","","10","70","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1329464","","","","Humans; Animals; Lisinopril; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Captopril/chemistry/pharmacology; Dipeptides/chemistry/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently we demonstrated that  the anti-hypertensive effect of BPP 10c is not related to the inhibition of sACE  alone, thus suggesting that this enzyme is not its only target for blood pressure  reduction. In the present work, a biodistribution study in Swiss mice of  [(125)I]-BPP 10c in the absence or in the presence of a saturating concentration  of captopril, a selective active-site inhibitor of sACE, demonstrated that: (1)  [(125)I]-BPP 10c was present in several organs and the renal absorption was  significantly high; (2) [(125)I]-BPP 10c showed a clear preference for the  kidney, maintaining a high concentration in this organ in the presence of  captopril for at least 3h; (3) The residual amount of [(125)I]-BPP 10c in the  kidney of animals simultaneously treated with captopril suggest that the peptide  can interact with other targets different from sACE in this organ. We also showed  that Cy3-labeled BPP 10c was internalized by human embryonic kidney cells  (HEK-293T). Taken together, these results suggest that sACE inhibition by  captopril affects the tissue distribution of [(125)I]-BPP 10c and that the  anti-hypertensive effects of BPP 10c are not only dependent on sACE inhibition.","2008-03-15","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","515-523","","4","51","","Toxicon","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18160089","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Mice; Cell Line; Tissue Distribution; Antihypertensive Agents/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; *Bothrops; Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Proline; Reptilian Proteins/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The patient was treated with antivenom, local anesthetic,  and fluid replacement. Most of the systemic manifestations disappeared within 1 h  after antivenom. Laboratory blood analyses at T0, T1, T6, T24, and T48 detected  circulating venom by ELISA only at T0, before antivenom infusion (47.5 ng/mL;  cut-off, 17.1 ng/mL); his serum blood sugar was 163 mg/dL at T0.

However, amongst these drugs, not all have the  same therapeutic effects, but they differ from one another in molecular  structures, cellular mechanisms, haemodynamic actions and modes of  administration. A three tier classification is proposed with the single objective  of facilitating the therapeutic choice: mechanism of action: this property  distinguishes the alpha-blockers from the beta-2 sympathomimetics, calcium  antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and prostacyclin  biosynthesis inducers. Some molecules such as hydralazine, whose mechanism of  action remains unclear, cannot be classified in this way; haemodynamic effects:  these effects can be used to distinguish vasodilators which act mainly on the  venous sector from arterial and mixed vasodilators. The knowledge of the  preferential site ol action of these molecules helps to adapt the choice of  treatment to the initial haemodynamic profile of each patient; pharmacokinetics:  these properties distinguish molecules active only by intravenous administration,  better adapted for the treatment of acute LVF in the intensive care unit, from  those active orally which can be used for long-term ambulatory therapy of chronic  cardiac failure. Trinitrin and its derivatives occupy an intermediate position  because of their relatively low bioavailability after oral administration:  long-term administration is not always easy and may require special modes of  administration (i.e. percutaneous). Vasodilators have been widely used in cardiac  failure for about 5 years; the results of some medium term controlled therapeutic  trials are now available and confirm the efficacy of these drugs but also define  their limitations: variable therapeutic efficacy: the number of responders ranges  from 30 to 60 p. 100 according to the molecule used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250  WORDS)","1985","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","256-260","","3","136","","Ann Med Interne (Paris)","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 3927808","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Prognosis; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Captopril/therapeutic use; Heart Ventricles/physiopathology; Molsidomine; Nitroglycerin/administration & dosage; Receptors, Adrenergic/drug effects; Sydnones/administration & dosage; Vasodilator Agents/classification/metabolism/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A continuous  administration of a Krebs-glucose solution into the intestinal lumen increased  the tolerated maximal bleeding volume from 31 to 70% of initial total blood  volume. The 'small intestinal' autotransfusion rate, i.e. the rate of fluid  mobilized from the intestinal lumen into the vascular compartment, was calculated  to 2.3 ml h-1 100 cm-2 small intestinal serosal surface. 'Small intestinal'  autotransfusion is proposed to be an important mechanism in the defence line  against hypovolaemia. Haemorrhage induced a 40% increase in small intestinal net  fluid absorption. This increase was abolished after pretreatment with Captopril,  an angiotensin-converting enzyme blocker. Post-ganglionic denervation of the  small intestine reduced, but did not abolish, the stimulatory effect of  haemorrhage on net fluid absorption. These results indicate that both a direct  nervous component and the renin-angiotensin system are of importance for the  increase in small intestinal net fluid absorption observed after haemorrhage.","1987-11","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","429-437","","3","131","","Acta Physiol Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3425347","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Hemodynamics; *Intestinal Absorption; *Water-Electrolyte Balance; *Plasma Volume; Denervation; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Hemorrhage/*metabolism/physiopathology; Intestine, Small/innervation/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its regional distribution paralleled that of  (Met5)enkephalin (YGGFM), a marker of enkephalin neurons. Ablation of these  neurons in the striato-pallidal pathway by intrastriatal kainate, induced a  significant decrease in YGG levels in caudateputamen and globus pallidus (-49%),  consistent with the hypothesis that YGG originates from enkephalin neurons. When  pallidal slices were incubated under various conditions, YGG was mainly found in  the incubation medium indicating a predominantly extracellular localization.  Depolarization of these slices by a K+-stimulus elicited a release of YGGFM  accompanied by a marked increase in YGG levels. Bestatin and amastatin further  enhanced YGG levels, reflecting the participation of aminopeptidases in the  metabolism of the tripeptide and its precursor. Captopril, an inhibitor of the  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) showed no effect on the recovery of YGGFM and  YGG. In contrast, the formation of YGG was completely prevented by Thiorphan  (IC50 value = 9 nM) and phosphoramidon, two inhibitors of ""enkephalinase"" (EC  3.4.24.11; membrane metallo-endopeptidase), thus identifying the latter as the  YGG-forming enzyme. The K+-induced increase in YGG + YGGFM levels in medium  containing bestatin exceeded by about 60% the amount of YGGFM released from  tissues, suggesting that YGG was mainly formed by extracellular hydrolysis of the  various opioid fragments of the proenkephalin molecule. In vivo, YGG levels of  cerebral regions were also markedly reduced in rats treated with acetorphan, a  parenterally active ""enkephalinase"" inhibitor. All data suggest that YGG levels  constitute an index of opioid peptide release.","1986-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","669-677","","4","7","","Peptides","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3532054","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Tissue Distribution; Radioimmunoassay; Protease Inhibitors; Oligopeptides/metabolism; Brain/metabolism/*physiology; Endopeptidases; Endorphins/*metabolism; Enkephalin, Methionine/metabolism; Globus Pallidus/metabolism; Microwaves; Neprilysin; Thiorphan; Tiopronin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enzyme activity  was associated with the brush-border membrane fraction, with the highest activity  in the proximal to midregion of the small intestine. Preliminary enzyme  characterization studies were carried out using purified brush-border membrane  preparations. When a variety of N-blocked synthetic peptides were used as  potential substrates for ACE, activity was highest with those containing proline  at the carboxy terminal position. The hydrolytic rates observed with these prolyl  peptides were comparable to those observed when major digestive peptidases of the  brush-border membrane such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV  were assayed. When isolated rat jejunum was perfused in vivo with solutions of  Bz-Gly-Ala-Pro, the dipeptide Ala-Pro was the main hydrolytic product detected in  the perfusates. Absorption rates of the constituent amino acids, alanine and  proline, depended on the concentration of peptide perfused. Captopril, an active  site specific ACE inhibitor, significantly inhibited hydrolysis and absorption of  constituent amino acids from Bz-Gly-Ala-Pro. These results show that intestinal  brush-border membrane ACE functions as a digestive peptidase in addition to its  role as a regulator of biologically active peptides in other tissues.","1987-12","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","G781-786","","6 Pt 1","253","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2827504","","","","Male; Animals; Substrate Specificity; Rats; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; Dietary Proteins/*metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/*enzymology; Intestine, Small/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Oligopeptides/metabolism; Microvilli/*enzymology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Markers suitable for the identification of these  cells under viable conditions would allow new experimental approaches in the  study of biological interactions between hormone-producing cells and tissue  macrophages. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dipeptide uptake was studied in primary  cultures from rat testis and ovaries with the fluorescent dipeptide derivative  beta-Ala-Lys-N epsilon-aminomethylcoumarin acetic acid (AMCA). Fluorescence  microscopic studies revealed that the reporter peptide accumulated specifically  in testicular macrophages, which were identified by subsequent immunostaining  with the OX-42 antibody. In the ovarian cultures, however, transport of the  fluorescence-labeled dipeptide was observed in cells that exhibited the  morphological characteristics of macrophages but did not show positive  immunoreactivity against the antibody employed. In both cases, dipeptide  accumulation was blocked by the addition of Tyr-Gly, thus indicating that  transport was not due to endocytosis. Competition studies performed with primary  cultures from testis have shown that di-and tripeptides effectively reduce uptake  of the tracer peptide, whereas compounds without an alpha- or beta-amino group,  such as captopril and benzylpenicillin, do not. CONCLUSIONS: These results  indicate that the testicular and ovarian macrophages are equipped with a  dipeptide transport system. The selective accumulation of the fluorescent  dipeptide derivative beta-Ala-Lys-N epsilon-AMCA in testicular and ovarian  macrophages permits the identification of these cell types under viable  conditions.","1996-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","662-667","","4","245","","Anat Rec","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8837724","","","","Male; Female; Biomarkers; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dipeptides/*pharmacokinetics; Histocytochemistry; Peptides/pharmacology; Amino Acids/pharmacology; Macrophages/*cytology/*metabolism; Ovary/cytology/*metabolism; Testis/cytology/*metabolism; Tranexamic Acid/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine if excessive activation  of this system might cause dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps in some  patients, we conducted a double-blind, randomized and balanced trial in which 5  patients with frequent dialysis-associated cramps were each given either a 25 mg  oral dose of captopril or placebo 1 h before 8 consecutive dialyses. Captopril  increased the frequency of dialyses complicated by skeletal muscle cramps in 1  patient and did not affect cramp frequency in the other 4 patients. Predialysis  plasma renin activity (PRA) averaged 3.9 ng/ml/h (+/- SD) and was the same as in  unselected hemodialysis patients. Following captopril, PRA increased by an  average of 2.2 +/- 0.7 times, similar to the 2.6-fold increase that was reported  when this drug was used to prevent dialysis-associated hypertensive crises.  However, hemodialysis by itself did not activate the renin-angiotensin system as  consistently in patients with frequent dialysis-associated skeletal muscle cramps  as in unselected hemodialysis patients and the ratio of post- to predialysis PRA  averaged 1.0 +/- 0.6.

Rats (10 in each group) were treated for 3 weeks with drugs or control diluents  administered daily by gavage. The agents, in general, had similar hemodynamic  effects, although these effects on cardiac mass were variable; some agents  reduced left ventricular mass and some produced no change. These effects occurred  in hypertrophied as well as nonhypertrophied chambers. Furthermore, changes in  left ventricular pumping ability were not necessarily related to the ability of  these agents to change left ventricular mass; this dissociation in performance  was neither related to change in structure nor to changes in aortic  distensibility. Thus, even within a same class of antihypertensive agents (i.e.,  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), similarly induced hemodynamic  alterations were associated with inconsistent changes in left ventricular pumping  ability or aortic distensibility regardless of whether the structure was  hypertrophied before therapy. These dissociated responses in cardiovascular  structure and function may be related to pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic  differences; alternatively, they also may be related to these differences in  action on local myocytic renin-angiotensin systems or in intramyocytic biological  responses.","1991-10","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","II2-7","","4 Suppl","18","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1916997","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Rats, Inbred WKY; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Rats, Inbred SHR; Aorta/*drug effects/physiology; Heart/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In  this study, we investigated in unrestrained rats whether systemic administration  of captopril-lysozyme also results in an enhanced effect on renal parameters,  relative to the systemic effects. 2 Renal effects: intravenous infusion of  captopril-lysozyme for 6 h resulted in a more pronounced increment of renal blood  flow (31+/-2% vs 17+/-4% at 0.5 mg kg(-1) 6h(-1), P<0.01) and an approximately 5  fold enhanced natriuresis (167+/-17% vs 36+/-7% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001)  in comparison with equimolar amounts of captopril as a free drug. In  correspondence with these findings, renal ACE inhibition was potentiated  approximately 5 fold (-50+/-4% vs -22+/-3% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001). 3  Systemic effects: conjugated captopril did not affect blood pressure in dosages  up to 5 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1). This effect coincided with a less pronounced  inhibition of the pressor response to intravenously administered angiotensin I  (-12+/-3% vs -66+/-5% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001), and a markedly attenuated  plasma ACE inhibition (-19+/-2% vs -37+/-3% at 1 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), P<0.001)  compared to an equivalent dose of free captopril. 4 An experiment of continued  intravenous administration of captopril-lysozyme for 7 days in nephrotic syndrome  demonstrated that the conjugate is also active in renal disease: the  antiproteinuric response was substantially augmented (-67+/-5% vs -15+/-7% at 4  mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1), P<0.001) compared to the free drug, in the absence of blood  pressure reduction. 5 These data demonstrate that intravenous administration of a  captopril-lysozyme conjugate leads to more selective renal ACE inhibition and  enhanced renal effects as well as less systemic effects compared to captopril  itself.","2002-08","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1107-1116","","8","136","","Br J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12163343  PMCID: PMC1573442","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Intravenous; Rats, Wistar; Immunohistochemistry; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Regional Blood Flow; Drug Carriers; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Doxorubicin; Captopril/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Angiotensin I/drug effects; Kidney/blood supply/*drug effects/enzymology; Muramidase; Nephrotic Syndrome/chemically induced/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I came away with the impression that  although there might be variations with renal function, hypotension and so on,  most of you felt that it was ACE inhibition that was of primary importance, and  that it was therefore permissible to extrapolate from one study to another. The  recently published AIRE study of post-infarct patients used ramipril, with a  change in mortality that gives credence to the idea that it's not just captopril,  not just enalapril, but is likely to be a class effect of ACE inhibitors. I think  that's the feeling I got from you. Do ACE inhibitors prolong life? I think  Professor Weich made a very simple and a very good point, because it allowed us a  general extrapolation. The simple point is: the sicker the patient, certainly  with heart failure, the more the benefit of the ACE inhibitor. It's like the idea  that in elderly hypertensives, or the diabetic hypertensive, the greater the risk  factor the greater the benefit. The more we want to treat prophylactically,  whether it's micro-albuminuria, or transient hypertension, or minimal left  ventricular dysfunction, the longer we will have to treat, and the more patients  we will have to treat to get objective evidence of any differences.

The levels of plasma renin, kidney renin,  and kidney renin mRNA were examined in 6- and 9-wk-old transgenic mice and were  found to be significantly lower than their age-matched non-transgenic littermates  and were nonresponsive to captopril treatment. However, there was no significant  difference in conscious mean arterial pressure between transgenic and  non-transgenic mice. The levels of renal renin mRNA in transgenics and  nontransgenic littermates were compared throughout ontogeny and were found to be  equal in newborns, elevated 3- to 5-fold in 1-wk-old transgenics, and yet  decreased 10-fold by 6 wk of age in transgenic mice. Expression of the transgene  in the kidney exhibited the proper developmental pattern and was properly  restricted to juxtaglomerular cells in neonatal mice. Nevertheless, in adult  mice, T-antigen-containing cells were found throughout the entire renal arterial  tree. The observed ability of renal vascular cells to be recruited to express  both renin and T-antigen suggests a mechanism that can explain the development of  the renal pathology in these mice.","1991-02","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","F249-257","","2 Pt 2","260","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1996675","","","","Animals; Mice; Tissue Distribution; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Blood Pressure; Kidney/metabolism/pathology; Captopril/pharmacology; Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*genetics; Mice, Transgenic/blood/metabolism/*physiology; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/pathology/*physiopathology; Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics; Renin/blood/*genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measurements of CE activity and angiotensin II concentrations  revealed that after oral administration of CE inhibitors, CE was inhibited not  only in lung vascular endothelium and blood, but also in the heart, kidney,  vascular wall, brain and other organs. The functional significance of tissue CE  inhibition is suggested first by the antihypertensive effect of brain CE  inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats, second by the concomitant  persistence of blood pressure decrease and CE inhibition in vascular wall and  kidney after long-term oral CE inhibitor treatment and third by ex vivo  experiments demonstrating marked effects of oral CE inhibitor pretreatment on  cardiac function in isolated rat hearts.

A  glucoheptonate renogram protocol was developed for use in rats anaesthetized with  sodium pentobarbital. An 123I-hippuran scan was performed to determine the  relative renal function, followed by a control 99Tcm-GHA scan. Five minutes after  administering captopril, another 99Tcm-GHA scan was performed.

To study tissue-specific  regulation of the expression of the AT1 receptor in the rat, we altered activity  of the renin-angiotensin system by feeding rats a low (0.07% NaCl), normal (0.3%  NaCl), or high (7.5% NaCl) salt chow for 14 days; infusing Ang II (200 ng/kg per  minute IP) or vehicle for 7 days; and administering an angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 100 mg/dL in the drinking water) or vehicle for 7  days. Renin, angiotensinogen, and total AT1 receptor mRNA levels were measured by  slot-blot hybridization with cRNA probes, and AT1 receptor subtypes (A and B)  were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the presence  of a cRNA internal standard. Plasma renin concentration and renal renin, renal  and hepatic angiotensinogen, and hepatic AT1 receptor mRNA levels were all  inversely related to salt intake; in contrast, renal AT1 receptor mRNA levels  were significantly lower in rats fed low salt, a difference that was exclusively  due to a decrease in the AT1A subtype. This difference did not appear to be  mediated by a change in the circulating levels of Ang II, because Ang II infusion  reduced plasma renin concentration and renal renin mRNA with no effect on either  angiotensinogen or AT1 receptor mRNA levels in kidney or liver, renal Ang II  receptor density (determined by in situ autoradiography) decreased, presumably  via a posttranscriptional mechanism. Similarly, inhibition of Ang II generation  with captopril increased plasma renin concentration and renal renin mRNA levels  without altering renal or hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA or renal AT1 receptor mRNA  levels. Thus, AT1 receptor gene expression is regulated in a tissue-specific  manner that is distinct from other components of systemic and local  renin-angiotensin systems and that appears to be mediated by a mechanism other  than through changes in the circulating levels of Ang II.","1996-09","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","403-408","","3","28","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8794824","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tissue Distribution; Liver/metabolism; Kidney/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; RNA, Messenger/*metabolism; Captopril/pharmacology; Diet, Sodium-Restricted; Angiotensin II/blood; Angiotensinogen/genetics; Receptors, Angiotensin/*genetics; Renin/blood/genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, no change was observed in the AcSDKP concentration in  spleen and in the intracellular fraction of bone marrow. In conclusion, during  chronic ACE inhibition in rats, AcSDKP levels slightly increased in organs with  high ACE contents. No such increase occurred in hematopoietic organs. AcSDKP had  to be combined with captopril to significantly increase its concentration in  tissues other than the spleen.

Its active form, CS-622 diacid, was slightly more potent than enalaprilat in inhibiting ACE  isolated from rabbit lung. The inhibitory potency of CS-622 diacid on isolated  rat aorta was 3 times that of enalaprilat. The inhibitory action of enalaprilat  was abolished quickly by washing the aortic strip with drug-free solution,  whereas that of CS-622 diacid was abolished only slowly. This difference suggests  that CS-622 diacid binds to vascular ACE more firmly than enalaprilat. By oral  administration, CS-622 was 3 times more potent than enalapril, and its onset of  action was faster than that of enalapril, suggesting that the conversion of  CS-622 to its active diacid occurs faster than the conversion of enalapril.  Although CS-622 diacid was only slightly more potent than enalaprilat by  intravenous administration, it had a longer duration than enalaprilat.  Elimination of renal excretory function potentiated the action of captopril but  not that of CS-622, suggesting that unlike captopril, only a small portion of  CS-622 is excreted through the kidney.","1988-11","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","349-356","","3","48","","Jpn J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 2851680","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Prodrugs; Muscle Contraction/drug effects; Lung/enzymology; Enalaprilat; Enalapril/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Aorta/drug effects; Thiazepines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After intraventricular captopril (0.5 mg), the accumulation rate of  immunoreactive YGGFMRF was greater in haloperidol- than in saline-injected rats.  Intraventricular captopril inhibits the YGGFMRF degradation; hence the greater  accumulation rate of YGGFMRF caused by captopril in haloperidol-treated rats  suggests that this drug increases the YGGFMRF biosynthesis. A slower rate of  YGGFMRF release in haloperidol-treated rats can be excluded as a cause for the  drug-induced increase in striatal content of this peptide because the release  rates of YGGFMRF elicited by K+ were similar in striatal slices of haloperidol-  and saline-treated rats. The similarities between the accumulation rate of  immunoreactive YGGFMRF and of Met5-enkephalin induced by haloperidol suggest that  haloperidol increases the biosynthesis of the specific messenger RNA for  preproenkephalin, an opioid peptide precursor, which contains one copy of YGGFMRF  and several copies of Met5-enkephalin.","1984-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","171-174","","1","229","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6368796","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Rats, Inbred Strains; Tissue Distribution; Captopril/pharmacology; Corpus Striatum/*metabolism; Enkephalin, Methionine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Haloperidol/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many clinical studies have  demonstrated a different effect on blood pressure of the majority of  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), studied as function of the  moment of their administration. Until now, the majority of clinical proofs  sustain the greater benefit offered by bedtime administration of ACEIs,  concerning especially a significantly greater efficacy in reducing BP during the  asleep period, thus increasing the prevalence of ""dippers"", the circadian profile  considered to offer the best cardio-vascular prognosis, compared to at awakening  administration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated time-dependent  effects of zofenopril (Zomen, 30 mg, Berlin-Chemie, Menarini Group, Romania)  administration on ambulatory blood pressure values. We studied 33 consecutive  untreated hypertensive patients (19 men, 14 women), 56 +/- 12.7 years old, with  grade 1 or 2 uncomplicated essential hypertension (according to the European  Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology guidelines) (diagnostic  formulated by casual determination and confirmed by an ABPM session at baseline),  using zofenopril as monotherapy. The drug was initially administered in a single  dose, at bedtime, during one month; after that period, we performed for all of  them a new ABPM session, and, after that, for another month we administered the  same drug, in single dose, at awakening. Blood pressure was measured for 48 hours  before and after one month of treatment. RESULTS: The blood pressure reduction  during diurnal activity was similar for both treatment schedules. Bedtime  administration of zofenopril, however, was significantly more efficient than at  awakening administration in reducing asleep blood pressure. The awake:asleep  blood pressure ratio was decreased after zofenopril on awakening but  significantly increased towards a more dipping pattern, (from 60.60% to 90.90%)  after at bedtime administration. The proportion of patients with controlled  ambulatory BP increased from 51.51% to 84.84% (p < 0.001) by bedtime  administration. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal blood pressure regulation is significantly  better achieved at bedtime as compared with at awakening administration of  zofenopril, without any loss in efficacy during diurnal active hours; this might  be clinically important, because nighttime blood pressure has been shown to be a  more relevant marker of cardiovascular risks than diurnal mean values. The change  in the dose-response curve, the increased proportion of controlled patients, and  improved efficacy on nighttime BP values by bedtime administration of zofenopril  should be taken into account when prescribing this ACEI for treatment of  essential hypertension.","2011","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","75-84","","1","49","","Rom J Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 22026256","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Treatment Outcome; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Severity of Illness Index; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Captopril/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; *Drug Chronotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We perfused isolated hearts from rats overexpressing the human  angiotensinogen gene in a Langendorff preparation and measured the hemodynamic  effects and the released products. We also investigated cardiac Ang I conversion,  including the contribution of non-angiotensin-converting enzyme-dependent Ang  II-generating pathways. Finally, we studied Ang I conversion in vitro in heart  homogenates. Renin and Ang I infusion both generated Ang II. Ang II release and  vasoconstriction continued after renin infusion was stopped, even though renin  disappeared immediately from the perfusate. In contrast, after Ang I infusion,  Ang II release and coronary flow returned to basal levels. Ang I conversion (Ang  II/Ang I ratio) was higher after renin infusion (0.109+/-0.027 versus  0.026+/-0.003, 15 minutes, P<.02) compared with infused Ang I. Remikiren added to  the renin infusion abolished Ang I and II; captopril suppressed only Ang II,  whereas an AT1 receptor blocker did not affect Ang I and II formation. All the  drugs prevented renin-induced coronary flow changes. Total cardiac Ang II-forming  activity was only partially inhibited by cilazaprilat (4.1+/-0.1 fmol x min(-1) x  mg[-1]) and on a larger extent by chymostatin (2.6+/-0.3 fmol x min(-1) x mg[-1])  compared with control values (5.6+/-0.4 fmol x min(-1) x mg[-1]). We conclude  that renin can be taken up by cardiac or coronary vascular tissue and induces  long-lasting local Ang II generation and vasoconstriction. Locally formed Ang I  was converted more effectively than infused Ang I. Furthermore, the comparison of  in vivo and in vitro Ang I conversion suggests that in vitro assays may  underestimate the functional contribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme to  intracardiac Ang II formation.","1998-01-09","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","13-20","","1","82","","Circ Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9440700","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; In Vitro Techniques; Time Factors; Perfusion; Losartan; Blood Flow Velocity/drug effects; Myocardium/*metabolism; Imidazoles/pharmacology; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Heart/drug effects; Captopril/pharmacology; Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology; Tetrazoles/pharmacology; Coronary Circulation/drug effects; Angiotensin II/drug effects/*metabolism; Vasoconstriction/drug effects/physiology; Chymases; Angiotensin I/drug effects/metabolism/pharmacology; Coronary Vessels/drug effects/physiology; Renin/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.","Human pharmacogenetics of methyl conjugation.","Federation proceedings","","0014-9446","","","Methyl conjugation is an important pathway in drug metabolism. Activities of three human drug-metabolizing methyltransferase enzymes,  catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (EC 2.1.1.6), thiopurine methyltransferase (  TPMT ) (EC 2.1.1.67), and thiol methyltransferase (TMT) (EC 2.1.1.9), are  controlled by inheritance. COMT activity in the red blood cell (RBC) is regulated  by a single genetic locus with two alleles, COMTL for low activity and COMTH for  high activity. Gene frequencies of these two alleles were approximately equal in  a white population sample of Northern European origin. The genetically controlled  level of COMT activity in the RBC reflects the level of enzyme activity in other  tissues and is significantly correlated with individual variations in the methyl  conjugation of catechol drugs such as L-dopa and methyldopa. TPMT catalyzes the  S-methylation of thiopurines and thiopyrimidines . RBC TPMT activity is also  controlled by a single genetic locus with two alleles, TPMTL for low and TPMTH  for high activity. The gene frequencies of these two alleles were 0.06 and 0.94,  respectively, in a white population sample. RBC TPMT activity reflects the level  of enzyme activity in other cells and tissues such as the lymphocyte and kidney.  TMT catalyzes the S-methylation of aliphatic sulfhydryl compounds such as the  drugs captopril and D-penicillamine. The heritability of the level of RBC  membrane TMT activity has been estimated on the basis of family studies to be  approximately 0.98. Regulation of these three methyl-conjugating enzymes by  inheritance raises the possibility that genetically determined methylator status  may be one factor responsible for variations in drug metabolism in humans.","1984-05-15","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","2303-2307","","8","43","","Fed Proc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6714437","","","","Humans; Biotransformation; Polymorphism, Genetic; Alleles; Gene Frequency; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism; Methylation; *Pharmacogenetics; Erythrocytes/enzymology; Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics; Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The formation of des-9-BK was strongly blocked by  DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (MGPA) and that of  des-8,9-BK and [1-5] BK was inhibited by captopril. When guinea pigs were  pretreated with a cocktail of 2-mercaptoethanol, MGPA and captopril, intravenous  administration of leukotriene (LT) C4 (10 nmol/kg) caused an increase in the  levels of free kinin in the bronchial washings of guinea pigs.

ACE was determined with tritiated  hippuryl-glycylglycine as substrate. Lysyl-bradykinin (LBK) hydrolysis (kininase  activity) was measured by radioimmunoassay. ACE was only found in the glomerulus  and in the two parts of proximal tubule: the convoluted proximal tubule and the  pars recta (PR). It was distributed along a concentration gradient which  increased from the glomerulus to PR. Kininase activity was found in both proximal  and distal parts of the nephron. Besides intense LBK-hydrolyzing activity in the  proximal tubule, a kininase activity was also found in the medullary collecting  tubule (MCT). Kininase activity in the glomerulus and the proximal tubule was  completely inhibited by chelating agents. Captopril inhibited this activity only  in the PR and at high concentrations (above 10(-7) M). These results indicate  that several types of enzymes other than ACE hydrolyze kinins in the glomerulus  and in the proximal tubule. The contribution of ACE to kinin hydrolysis appears  only minimal. The kininase activity found in MCT was different from ACE and other  proximal tubule kininases because it was not inhibited by chelating agents. This  kininase may play a physiological role in inactivating the kinins formed by  kallikrein at or beyond the connecting tubule.","1987-03","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","744-751","","3","31","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3033387","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Hydrolysis; Tissue Distribution; Captopril/pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*metabolism; Edetic Acid/pharmacology; Oligopeptides/metabolism; Kinins/*metabolism; Kallidin/metabolism; Kidney Glomerulus/enzymology; Kidney Tubules, Collecting/enzymology; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/enzymology; Microbial Collagenase/pharmacology; Nephrons/drug effects/*enzymology; Phenanthrolines/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is one member of a class of potent,  purportedly paracrine substances that act at receptors in multiple target organs.  Antagonists to the receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB, have been designed around the  hydrophobic carboxy-terminus of ET-1. The resulting hexapeptides possess low  nanomolar receptor affinity, but face formidable challenges to oral delivery,  given their peptidic nature. Hence, it was important to discriminate between  analogs, as well as to optimize structural features combining binding potency  with stability in intestinal fluids and permeability across biological membranes.  PD 142893 (Ac-DDip16-Leu-Asp-Ile-Trp21) and PD 145065  (Ac-DBhg16-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp21), as well as the N-methyl-isoleucine20 analogs  were studies, where DDip = 3,3diphenylalanine and DBhg =  10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene glycine. Analyses were conducted with  specific HPLC methods. Permeabilities across CACO-2 cell monolayers ranged from  2.0x10(-4) to 6.3x10(-4)cm/min. The results suggested that these compounds can be  absorbed in vivo, based on comparison of permeabilities with those obtained with  reference compounds. Much greater differences were observed between the analogs  when stability half-lives were compared after incubation in rat intestinal  perfusate. The parent peptides, PD 142893 and PD 145065, were unstable, with  half-lives less than 20 min. N-Methylation of Ile20 resulted in large increases  in stability half-lives to greater 500 min. Enzyme inhibition studies  demonstrated the involvement of carboxypeptidase A in production of the primary  metabolite, the des-Trp derivative. Identification of the primary metabolite of  the parent peptide was made by differential UV scanning at 214/280 nm and mass  spectral analyses.","1996","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","971-982","","12","58","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 8786709","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Wistar; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Permeability; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; *Endothelin Receptor Antagonists; Captopril/pharmacology; Oligopeptides/pharmacology; Competitive Bidding; Endothelins/*chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additional experiments demonstrated  that rats ingesting a high-Na diet exhibited levels of jejunal absorption lower  than animals fed a normal-Na diet. High-Na animals were not volume expanded.  Plasma aldosterone concentrations and plasma renin activity were reduced in  high-Na animals. Bilateral adrenalectomy-nephrectomy inhibited jejunal  absorption.

Tissues  were assayed for kallikrein-like esterolytic activity using three synthetic  kallikrein substrates (TAME, VGAN, and PPAN), and the presence of kallikrein  substrate (kininogen) in trout plasma was estimated by bradykinin (BK)  radioimmunoassay of plasma activated with trypsin (T). Formation of  pressor-depressor substances in vivo by porcine glandular kallikrein (GK) and T  was measured after intra-arterial injection into unanesthetized trout. Gill and  kidney contained kallikrein activity (TAME and VGAN assays); little activity was  observed with PPAN. Aprotinin inhibited gill activity (TAME assay). T liberated  42 +/- 3 (SE) ng (n = 10) of immunoreactive BK per milliliter of plasma.  Injection of GK in vivo reduced plasma kininogen levels for over 24 h. GK  produced pressor responses only in fish pretreated with the  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. This effect was mediated  partly through stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. T produced slight  pressor responses that were captopril insensitive. These results show that trout  possess elements of the KKS system including kallikrein-like enzymatic activity,  kininogen, receptor-mediated vascular sensitivity to kallikrein products, and  kininolytic activity consistent with ACE (kininase II).","1990-02","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","R501-506","","2 Pt 2","258","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2178452","","","","Animals; Tissue Distribution; Captopril/pharmacology; Kinins/*metabolism; Blood Vessels/drug effects; Kallikreins/*metabolism/pharmacology; Kininogens/metabolism; Salmonidae/*metabolism; Trout/*metabolism; Trypsin/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In infusion experiments in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, both  BK (0.3 micrograms/min) and ACEI (300 micrograms captopril/100 g) showed a  significant reduction of elevated blood glucose levels. In man, non-insulin  dependent diabetics (NIDD) and healthy subjects in postoperative (POP) stress  were examined. Peripheral insulin-sensitivity and muscular glucose balance were  determined using the glucose clamp technique and the forearm technique. In NIDD  as well as in POP subjects, impaired peripheral insulin responsiveness, as  evaluated by whole body glucose consumption, was improved up to 50% by  application of BK (80 micrograms/h i.v.) or ACEI (25 mg captopril p.o.),  respectively. This was most probably due to accelerated muscular glucose uptake  which was assessed in the same experiment and found to be increased 2- to 3-fold  under these conditions. As a molecular basis for the observed effects on muscular  glucose uptake, phosphofructokinase was found to be markedly stimulated by BK (8  X 10(-10)mol/l) in the isolated perfused rat heart, suggesting accelerated  glycolytic flux. It may be concluded that ACEI increase muscular insulin  responsiveness, thus being beneficial in insulin-resistant states as well as in  hypertension. This metabolic effect is most probably due to elevated systemic  kinin levels. Further investigations are required to evaluate the clinical  relevance of these findings.","1986","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","59-64","","","62 Suppl 1","","Postgrad Med J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3022274","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/blood/*metabolism; Captopril/*pharmacology; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Bradykinin/*pharmacology; Kinins/blood/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gills and corpuscles of Stannius exhibited greatest ACE  activity and contained over 30 times more enzyme than plasma on a per-wet-weight  basis. ACE was barely detectable in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney tissues.  Captopril lowered dorsal aortic pressure (DAP) within 1 min after injection.

To our knowledge there is no data which allows the physician  to conclude to any different antihypertensive efficacy when ACE inhibitors are  used at adequate dosage. Their pharmacokinetic characteristics may differ at  every level: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Differences in  chemical structure may also influence their diffusion in various tissues,  therefrom the amplitude and duration of inhibition of angiotensin II at these  sites. The duration of maximum blockade of ACE and the amplitude of residual  blockade may theoretically influence the duration of the hypotensive effect and  the number of daily dosages. Once-daily administered long acting ACE inhibitors  keep their antihypertensive action through the whole 24-hour period, during  chronic treatment. The theoretical advantage of such a property is an improved  control of 24-hour blood pressure. However, no study, to our knowledge, concluded  to any difference between long acting ACE inhibitors as far as this parameter was  concerned. In addition, except captopril which has been reported to induce major  untoward effects at the time high dosages were introduced, ACE inhibitors do not  seem to bear different undesirable effects.","1992-12-15","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","2533-2537","","20","42","","Rev Prat","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 1299936","","","","Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/classification/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondarily, to evaluate its potential impact on pharmaceutical  expenditure. DESIGN: Descriptive study of GDs utilization. Cost-minimization  analysis. SETTING: Galician autonomous region, year 1998. MEASUREMENTS AND  RESULTS: Using data from the prescription billing registry of Social Security we  have selected the active ingredients corresponding to GDs with prescriptions in  Galicia in 1997. We have analyzed the data for their oral single substance  preparations by quarters. Consumption in DHDs of allopurinol, atenolol,  captopril, naproxen and ranitidine remained stable during 1998. The market share  for their GDs in quantitative terms relative to both total consumption of the  active ingredients and to their pharmaceutical equivalents, showed an overall  growing trend. The maximum observed value was seen for ranitidine at last  quarter. Total expenditure (in final customer prices) during 1998 on the selected  active substances was higher than 1864 million pesetas. Potential savings  afforded by substitution for the lowest price GD prescribed in Galicia would  reach 427 million pesetas. CONCLUSIONS: GDs market penetration in Galicia during  1998 was limited but increasing. Its utilization may afford estimated savings of  21-28% of the cost for the selected drugs. However, the expenditure on the above  drugs was just 2.7% of total pharmaceutical expenditure.","1999-11-30","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","528-532","","9","24","","Aten Primaria","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 10687221","","","","Therapeutic Equivalency; Spain; Cost Savings/economics/statistics & numerical data; Drugs, Generic/economics/*supply & distribution; Marketing of Health Services/economics/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mucosal addition of glycyl-L-glutamine, captopril  (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) or cefadroxil (beta-lactam antibiotic)  did not change the short-circuit current (I(sc)), or tissue conductance (G(t)).  The intracellular pH, pH(i), in isolated REC was not influenced by the addition  of peptides to the buffer solution. These findings do not support the assumption  of proton-coupled or electrogenic peptide transport. The determination of  unidirectional flux rates of the peptide D-phenylalanyl-L-alanine (2,3-(3)H)  showed that the flux rate in the serosal-mucosal direction, J(sm), was greater  than J(ms), leading to a small net secretion of peptide. Transport was not  significantly inhibited by the serosal addition of ouabain. Enhancing the  paracelluIar permeability by an increase of osmotic pressure in the mucosal  solution (FREYER and MARTENS, Proc. Soc. Nutr. Physiol. 8, 80, 1999) caused an  increase of G(t) and significantly higher transport rates of peptide.

Using  the P. aeruginosa kaguma strain which produces a large amount of proteases,  further experiments were carried out. Results showed that two different protease  inhibitors (ovomacroglobulin and a synthetic peptide inhibitor against  pseudomonal elastase) as well as a kinin antagonist suppressed bacterial  dissemination to 1/10-1/100 of control. Similar results were observed in  experiments using Vibrio vulnificus.

We investigated in intact rat hearts whether (i)  enzymes other than ACE contribute to angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion  and (ii) the localization (endothelial/extra-endothelial) of converting enzymes.  DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a modified version of the rat Langendorff heart,  allowing separate collection of coronary effluent and interstitial fluid. Hearts  were perfused with angiotensin I (arterial concentration 5-10 pmol/ml) under  control conditions, in the presence of captopril (1 micromol/l) or after  endothelium removal with 0.2% triton X-100. Endothelium removal was verified as  the absence of a coronary vasodilator response to 10 nmol bradykinin. Angiotensin  I and angiotensin II were measured in coronary effluent and interstitial fluid  with sensitive radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: In control hearts, 45% of arterial  angiotensin I was metabolized during coronary passage, partly through conversion  to angiotensin II. At steady-state, the angiotensin I concentration in  interstitial fluid was three to four-fold lower than in coronary effluent, while  the angiotensin II concentrations in both fluids were similar. Captopril and  endothelium removal did not affect coronary angiotensin I extraction, but  increased the interstitial fluid levels of angiotensin I two- and three-fold,  respectively, thereby demonstrating that metabolism (by ACE) as well as the  physical presence of the endothelium normally prevent arterial angiotensin I from  reaching similar levels in coronary effluent and interstitial fluid. Captopril,  but not endothelium removal, greatly reduced the angiotensin II levels in  coronary effluent and interstitial fluid. With the ACE inhibitor, the angiotensin  II/I ratios in coronary effluent and interstitial fluid were 83 and 93% lower,  while after endothelium removal, the ratios were 33 and 71% lower. CONCLUSIONS:  In the intact rat heart, ACE is the main contributor to angiotensin I to  angiotensin II conversion, both in the coronary vascular bed and the  interstitium. Cardiac ACE is not limited to the coronary vascular endothelium.","2001-05","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","959-965","","5","19","","J Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 11393680","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Perfusion; Rats, Wistar; Tissue Distribution; Myocardium/*metabolism; Extracellular Space/metabolism; Endothelium, Vascular/physiology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*physiology; Angiotensin I/blood/*metabolism/pharmacology; Angiotensin II/blood/*metabolism; Coronary Circulation/physiology; Coronary Vessels/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The degradative rate (pmol/min/mg of protein) of  Met-enkephalin was high in caudate-putamen (5,160 +/- 120) and lower in nucleus  accumbens (3,630 +/- 110) and frontal cortex (3,180 +/- 120). Inhibition of  aminopeptidases decreased Met-enkephalin degradation (50-97% vs. control) in  frontal cortex but was less effective in caudate-putamen (20-34%). Tyr-Gly-Gly  and Phe-Met were recovered in caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens, whereas  negligible quantities of these fragments were recovered from frontal cortex.  Phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, decreased  Met-enkephalin degradation in caudate-putamen (14%) but had no effect on that in  frontal cortex. A cocktail of bestatin or leuhistin (inhibitors of  aminopeptidases), phosphoramidon, and captopril (an inhibitor of angiotensin  converting enzyme) protected Met-enkephalin from degradation (recovery > 95%) in  caudate-putamen.

Trandolaprilat  inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and displays similar  pharmacodynamic properties to other ACE inhibitors, improving haemodynamic and  cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension. Trandolapril 2 to 4mg  once daily effectively controls blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients  with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative  trials, trandolapril had similar antihypertensive efficacy to that of atenolol,  enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and sustained release nifedipine, but  was more effective than captopril. Combined therapy with trandolapril and  hydrochlorothiazide or sustained release nifedipine had a significantly greater  antihypertensive effect than either drug treatment alone. Further comparative  trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. The tolerability  profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, most adverse  events being generally mild and transient in nature, and trandolapril lacks  adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, trandolapril, with  its favourable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to  that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate  hypertension, is likely to provide a well tolerated option for the treatment of  this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine  its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients following myocardial  infarction.","1994-07","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","71-90","","1","48","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7525196","","","","Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Drug Tolerance; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Indoles/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of the  English-language literature was used to identify pertinent human and animal  studies, reviews, and case reports. STUDY SELECTION: All available sources were  reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Background information was obtained from comprehensive  reviews. Individual case reports were assimilated, and pertinent data were  extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Because hypertension is common in patients with  psychiatric illness and antihypertensive agents are used for a multiplicity of  indications, significant numbers of patients receive concurrent therapy with  antihypertensives and antipsychotics. Many antipsychotics may block the  antihypertensive efficacy of guanethidine and related drugs. The interaction  between clonidine and antipsychotics is defined less clearly. Limited data  suggest possible additive hypotensive effects when chlorpromazine and methyldopa  are given in combination. Increased plasma concentrations of thioridazine with a  resultant increase in adverse effects have been reported when propranolol or  pindolol are added to the regimen. A similar increase in chlorpromazine  concentrations has been reported when propranolol was added. Although there are  no reports documenting an interaction between a calcium-channel antagonist and an  antipsychotic, the possible inhibition of oxidative metabolism of antipsychotics,  additive calcium-blocking activity, and additive pharmacodynamic effects are  theorized. Hypotension and postural syncope were reported in a patient given  therapeutic dosages of chlorpromazine and captopril, and in 2 patients when  clozapine was added to enalapril therapy. CONCLUSIONS: No  antipsychotic-antihypertensive combination is absolutely contraindicated, but no  combination should be considered to be completely without risk. Antihypertensives  with no centrally acting activity, such as diuretics, may be the least likely to  result in adverse reactions. The combination of the beta-antagonists propranolol  or pindolol with thioridazine or chlorpromazine should be avoided if possible.  Scrupulous patient monitoring for attenuated or enhanced activity of either agent  is essential whenever antipsychotics and antihypertensives are given  concurrently.","1995-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","603-609","","6","29","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7663034","","","","Humans; Animals; Drug Interactions; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/pharmacology; Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Sympatholytics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infusion of angiotensin II (AII) also stimulates jejunal absorption,  and in a manner similar to hemorrhage. The elevation of jejunal absorption in  response to hemorrhage is not affected by removal of the adrenals but is totally  inhibited by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and by bilateral  nephrectomy. Thus, increased jejunal absorption following hemorrhage is mediated  by the renin-angiotensin system and is not secondary to aldosterone release.  Further experiments demonstrated that norepinephrine released from enteric  sympathetic nerves controls jejunal absorption through activation of  alpha-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of jejunal absorption by tyramine was  unaffected by propranolol but was totally abolished by phentolamine and by  peripheral sympathectomy was 6-hydroxydopamine (intact adrenal medulla). The  increase in jejunal absorption in response to hemorrhage also was unaffected by  propranolol but was inhibited totally by phentolamine, prazosin, and peripheral  sympathectomy.

Ibopamine acts  predominantly as a vasodilator and inhibitor of neuroendocrine activation in  congestive heart failure, but also has mild positive inotropic effects at higher  doses. The beneficial effects on cardiac and systemic haemodynamic parameters  seen in short term studies have been maintained in predominantly noncomparative  trials for up to 1 year, and improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA)  functional class and clinical symptoms have been observed in patients with  congestive heart failure of varying severity. In double-blind studies conducted  in small numbers of patients, the efficacy of ibopamine was comparable to that of  digoxin, captopril, enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Ibopamine can successfully  replace treatment with intravenous dopamine in patients with severe heart  failure, and is effective and well tolerated when administered in combination  with digoxin, diuretics and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  Ibopamine has shown no detrimental effects on renal function, few adverse effects  on neurohormonal parameters and has demonstrated no significant proarrhythmic  properties at therapeutic doses in patients with congestive heart failure. No  adverse metabolic effects were observed during ibopamine therapy in patients with  diabetes mellitus, nor did ibopamine have detrimental effects in patients with  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While reliable evidence is required  concerning effects on mortality before the role of ibopamine can be clearly  defined, the drug appears to be a useful agent for combination with conventional  therapies in treating patients with mild to severe congestive heart failure.","1993-12","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","556-584","","6","3","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7906158","","","","Humans; Aged; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Deoxyepinephrine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Dopamine Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, this risk is mitigated by preclinical in vivo CV studies,  based on which measured CV readouts are analyzed independently. Here, we apply a  regression approach to simultaneously integrate CV readouts, i.e., heart rate  (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and QT from five dog telemetry studies. These  CV studies comprise data on verapamil, captopril, dofetilide, pimobendan, and  formoterol, and are combined with the respective dog pharmacokinetic (PK)  profiles. A published PK/CV model structure for rats is extended by a  semi-mechanistic parameterization of the interaction between HR and QT specific  to dogs. This semi-mechanistic modelling approach allows differentiation between  compound-independent system-specific parameters (e.g., HR baseline) and  compound-specific parameters (e.g., EC(50)). Compared to previous results in  rodents, estimated parameters for dogs indicate stronger dependency of stroke  volume on HR, slower HR response, faster QT response and steeper  concentration-response relationships. In addition, we illustrate how to  practically apply the PK/CV model to derive concentration-response relationships  for CV readouts. This approach allows a more detailed quantitative evaluation  based on the maximum effect on CV effects (E(max)), the EC(50), and the steepness  of this relation (Hill coefficient) especially for HR-independent effects on QT  interval duration (QTc) while taking the systemic feedback into account. This  approach also allows to derive plasma concentrations associated with relevant CV  effects (""threshold concentration""; C(THRESH)). The presented modelling analysis  highlights the potential of an integrative evaluation of CV data and provides a  framework for obtaining quantitative insights from safety pharmacology  evaluations.","2022-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","107171","","","115","","J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Encapsulation efficiency of hybrid NCS increased in the order of  amlodipine>valsartan>captopril with average value of 42±0.9%, 91±1.5% and  96±1.9%, respectively.

I.","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and moderate hypertension.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199040030-00002","","Recently there has been extensive development of orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in addition to those already marketed, for  example, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril. It was initially thought  that ACE inhibitors were likely to be most useful as antihypertensive agents in  conditions in which circulating renin and angiotensin II were elevated. However,  it is now clear that they can also lower arterial pressure when plasma renin is  not high. In addition, they have beneficial effects in cardiac failure. Thus,  captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril can be used in the treatment of  mild to moderate hypertension either alone or in conjunction with diuretics or  calcium antagonists. Broadly speaking, efficacy appears to be similar to that of  beta-blockers or diuretics. Unfortunately, however, there are no long term  studies comparing one ACE inhibitor with another or with other classes of  antihypertensive agents. Furthermore, there are no prognostic studies which show  that use of ACE inhibitors reduces morbidity or mortality in hypertension. Many  new ACE inhibitors are undergoing clinical assessment, including alacepril,  cilazapril, fosenopril, perindopril, quinapril and ramipril. The drugs vary, in  that some exist in the active form whereas others are prodrugs which are  converted to the active agent following absorption. In addition they each possess  one of several ligands, for example, carboxyl, phosphinyl or sulfhydryl groups,  and so vary in their affinity for ACE. Although many of these agents are renally  excreted, a small number are metabolised via the liver (e.g. quinapril and  spirapril) and this may prove advantageous in the presence of renal impairment.  In common with captopril and enalapril, the new ACE inhibitors inhibit the  renin-angiotensin system and initial results suggest that they are effective in  lowering blood pressure in essential hypertension. Furthermore, they reduce  systemic vascular resistance in the absence of a reflex tachycardia. There are a  number of adverse effects which are attributable to the pharmacological mechanism  of the ACE inhibitors as a group; these include hypotension, particularly in  patients with high renin levels, prior diuretic use, renal impairment or in the  elderly. Additional adverse effects may relate to chemical structure. The high  incidence of adverse effects noted in early studies related to excess dosage and  to the presence of a sulfhydryl group, which the more recently developed ACE  inhibitors lack. The adverse effects most commonly reported with established and  new ACE inhibitors include headache and fatigue, cough, skin rashes, hypotension  and diarrhoea. As a group, ACE inhibitors have an acceptable but not negligible  adverse effect burden.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-09","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","326-345","","3","40","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2226219","","","","Humans; Quality of Life; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we assessed the efficacy of a novel AGT siRNA in spontaneously  hypertensive rats. Rats were treated with vehicle, siRNA (10 mg/kg fortnightly;  subcutaneous), valsartan (31 mg/kg per day; oral), captopril (100 mg/kg per day;  oral), valsartan+siRNA, or captopril+valsartan for 4 weeks (all groups, n=8).  Mean arterial pressure (recorded via radiotelemetry) was lowered the most by  valsartan+siRNA (-68±4 mm Hg), followed by captopril+valsartan (-54±4 mm Hg),  captopril (-23±2 mm Hg), siRNA (-14±2 mm Hg), and valsartan (-10±2 mm Hg). siRNA  and captopril monotherapies improved cardiac hypertrophy equally, but less than  the dual therapies, which also lowered NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type  natriuretic peptide). Glomerular filtration rate, urinary NGAL (neutrophil  gelatinase-associated lipocalin), and albuminuria were unaffected by treatment.  siRNA lowered circulating AGT by 97.9±1.0%, and by 99.8±0.1% in combination with  valsartan. Although siRNA greatly reduced renal Ang (angiotensin) I, only  valsartan+siRNA suppressed circulating and renal Ang II. This coincided with  decreased renal sodium hydrogen exchanger type 3 and phosphorylated sodium  chloride cotransporter abundances. Renin and plasma K(+) increased with every  treatment, but especially during valsartan+siRNA; no effects on aldosterone were  observed. Collectively, these data indicate that Ang II elimination requires >99%  suppression of circulating AGT. Maximal blockade of the renin-angiotensin system,  achieved by valsartan+siRNA, yielded the greatest reduction in blood pressure and  cardiac hypertrophy, whereas AGT lowering alone was as effective as conventional  renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Given its stable and sustained efficacy,  lasting weeks, RNA interference may offer a unique approach to improving therapy  adherence and treating hypertension.","2019-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1249-1257","","6","73","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31030610","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Disease Models, Animal; Liver/*metabolism; *Gene Expression Regulation; Injections, Subcutaneous; hypertension; RNA/genetics; acute kidney injury; Rats, Inbred SHR; renin-angiotensin system; Blood Pressure/drug effects/*physiology; RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensinogen/biosynthesis/*genetics; Hypertension/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism; hypertrophy, left ventricular; RNA, small interfering; RNAi therapeutics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is highly selective for vascular smooth muscle, with very few negative inotropic or  chronotropic effects. It may have minor depressant effects on the sinoatrial  node, hence reducing the incidence of reflex tachycardia. The drug is extensively  metabolized in the liver, with several pharmacologically inactive metabolites. As  the elimination half-life is about 9 h the drug is usually given twice daily, but  a once-daily modified release form is under investigation. Isradipine is  effective monotherapy in essential hypertension, and has been successfully  combined with pindolol and captopril. On the basis of more limited evidence it  also appears to be beneficial in stable angina and in congestive cardiac failure.  A trial is also under way to assess its antiatherogenic properties. Adverse  effects are those predicted for a vasodilator calcium antagonist, and may be less  frequent than for equivalent doses of nifedipine. This needs to be confirmed by  more extensive clinical experience. Overall, isradipine can be considered  favourably in essential hypertensives where a calcium channel blocker is  indicated, particularly if it is desirable to avoid myocardial depression or to  minimize reflex tachycardia. Its role in other cardiovascular disease awaits  further evaluation.","1991-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","79-91","","2","16","","J Clin Pharm Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1830320","","","","Humans; Animals; Angina Pectoris/drug therapy; Arteriosclerosis/prevention & control; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/drug therapy; Pyridines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Isradipine; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This finding highlights the need for new treatment strategies that are  sufficiently effective throughout the dosing interval, well tolerated, and  available in a convenient, once-daily regimen. Monotherapy with any individual  drug class is often unable to fulfil all of these criteria in more than a  minority of patients. In contrast, once-daily therapy with rational combinations  of antihypertensive drugs offers a promising approach to improving treatment of  hypertension. The highly vascular selective calcium antagonist felodipine and the  cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol have complementary mechanisms of action,  making them appropriate for use together in the management of hypertension. A new  extended-release (ER) formulation, combining felodipine, 5 mg, and metoprolol, 50  mg*, has therefore been developed. This formulation has been shown to provide  significantly greater reductions and higher antihypertensive response rates than  either agent used alone. This high efficacy is achieved with maintained good  tolerability. In comparative trials, felodipine-metoprolol has also been shown to  be more effective than combination treatment with nifedipine and atenolol, or  captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. It is concluded that the felodipine-metoprolol  ER tablet offers predictably high 24 h antihypertensive response rates from a  convenient and well-tolerated once-daily dose.","1995-07","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","S37-42","","","9 Suppl 2","","J Hum Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 7562898","","","","Humans; Treatment Outcome; Drug Combinations; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Drug Therapy, Combination; Antihypertensive Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Felodipine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Metoprolol/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part 2.","Australian family physician","","0300-8495","","","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now widely used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. They are of particular value in  treating hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and in  diabetics where they have been shown to delay the progression of diabetic  nephropathy. Differences in the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and  pharmacodynamics between the various ACE inhibitors generally do not translate  into significant clinical differences in the majority of patients. However,  fosinopril may be the preferred ACE inhibitor in patients with significant renal  dysfunction because of a reduced requirement for dosage reduction. The duration  of action of ACE inhibitors is determined by two properties, the plasma half-life  and the affinity of binding to tissue ACE. All of the ACE inhibitors (with the  possible exception of captopril) can provide satisfactory 24-hour blood pressure  control in the majority of patients with mild to moderate hypertension when given  once daily. Lisinopril provides consistently better 24-hour control of blood  pressure than either captopril or enalapril. Evidence for superior 24-hour blood  pressure control over enalapril has not been as well established for the other  ACE inhibitors. Captopril may be preferred for initiating therapy in patients  with severe heart failure who are at risk of first dose hypertension because of  its rapid onset of action and relatively short duration of action. There is  evidence, however, that perindopril may have a low risk of first dose  hypertension in heart failure because of its gradual onset of action.

CASE SUMMARY: Girl 5 years old, diagnosed of tricodistrofia included within the  Tay-Sachs syndrome.

After  several months of treatment and a poor control of the hypertension, a change of  treatment was decided, substituting nifedipine by amlodipine (2.5 mg/24 hours  orally) and captopril by enalapril (2.5 mg/24 hours orally). Pharmacy service is  request to get a amlodipine syrup that allows a dose adjustment to the needs of  the patient. After the change of treatment the patient begins to maintain  diastolic blood pressure levels within the normal range, suspending the  administration of enalapril, maintaining good control of blood pressure with  amlodipine 2 mg/24 hours. DISCUSSION: Most of antihypertensive drugs used in  adults do not have clinical trials to evaluate its effects in the pediatric  population. Furthermore, the lack of familiarity with the pharmacokinetic  characteristics of the child, raises problems to adjust the dose to the changing  reality of a child.

It lowers peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.  Enalapril 10 to 40 mg/day administered either once or twice daily is effective in  lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension,  and shows similar efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide,  beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and captopril. Most patients  achieve adequate blood pressure control on enalapril alone or with  hydrochlorothiazide. In patients with severe congestive heart failure resistant  to conventional therapy, enalapril improves cardiac performance by a reduction in  both preload and afterload, and improves clinical status long term. Enalapril  appears to be well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported. It  does not induce the bradycardia associated with beta-blockers or the adverse  effects of diuretics on some laboratory values. In fact, the hypokalaemic effect  of hydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the addition of enalapril. The incidence  of the main (but rare) side effects of hypotension in hypovolaemic patients and  reduced renal function in certain patients with renovascular hypertension, which  are also seen with captopril, might be reduced by careful dosage titration,  discontinuation of diuretics, and monitoring of at-risk patients. Thus, enalapril  is a particularly worthwhile addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium, as  an alternative for treatment of all grades of essential and renovascular  hypertension. It also shows promise in the treatment of congestive heart failure.","1986-03","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","198-248","","3","31","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3011386","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Drug Interactions; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Enalapril/administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology/poisoning/therapeutic use; Kallikreins/physiology; Kinins/physiology; Prostaglandins/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  common aetiological relationship between renal disease and elevated BP also is  the reason that diuretic therapy continues to be included in many treatment  regimens. A number of ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, although  only captopril has been subjected to any meaningful degree of investigation in  children. Initial doses of captopril are 0.5 mg/kg in children > 6 months of age  and 0.01-0.1 mg/kg in neonates, because of an apparent increased antihypertensive  effect and duration of action in this age group. Side-effects are few and the  major adverse effect is a reduction in glomerular filtration in patients with  bilateral renal artery stenosis. The calcium channel blockers reduce cytosolic  calcium concentration and are particularly effective in patients with volume  dependent forms of hypertension. The pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs  are similar with drug clearance by hepatic metabolism. In particular, nifedipine  has a rapid onset of action and is widely used to treat hypertensive emergencies.  Although it has been used sublingually, the effectiveness of the drug is due to  absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Few side-effects from these drugs  have been reported in children. Heart rate and cardiac output increase but return  to pretreatment levels within a few weeks. As is the case with the ACE  inhibitors, calcium channel blockers appear to have a positive effect on renal  function.","1994-05","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","389-394","","5","8","","J Hum Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8064788","","","","Humans; Child; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Calcium Channel Blockers/*therapeutic use; Diuretics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  present experiments tested the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system is  involved in regulating the PBR. Eighty min of brief, intermittent tailshocks  caused increases in plasma renin activity and decreases in renal PBR binding. The  stress-induced decrease in renal PBR binding was reversed by pretreatment with  captopril. Acute administration of angiotensin II (ANG II) alone caused  reductions in PBR binding in kidney, heart, and cerebral cortex. These data  suggest that ANG II may be an endogenous factor responsible for regulating the  PBR in several tissues during stress.","1994","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","43-54","","1","19","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9210211","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiology; Pituitary-Adrenal System/physiology; Renin/blood; Sympathetic Nervous System/physiology; Renin-Angiotensin System/*physiology; Kidney/*innervation; Angiotensin II/physiology; Arousal/*physiology; Benzodiazepinones/pharmacokinetics; Receptors, GABA-A/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In  common with enalapril, it is also a prodrug. After absorption, perindopril is  hydrolysed to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, and with once daily  administration adequate 24-hour inhibition of ACE is obtained. Perindopril 4 to  8mg once daily is usually effective for blood pressure control in patients with  mild to moderate essential hypertension. Those patients who do not respond  adequately to monotherapy with perindopril usually respond with the addition of a  second agent, such as a thiazide diuretic. General practice trials indicate that  perindopril is at least as effective and as well tolerated as usual therapeutic  dosages of captopril, atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride in mild to  moderate essential hypertension. Preliminary results indicate that perindopril  may also be effective in patients with severe hypertension or congestive heart  failure. Perindopril is generally well tolerated and has an adverse effect  profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors.

Glycylsarcosine was chosen as a model dipeptide and [(3)H] glycylsarcosine was  administered through the marginal ear vein of New Zealand white rabbits. At the  end of an experimental period, vitreous humor, retina and aqueous humor were  collected. Time dependent uptake of glycylsarcosine into ocular tissues was  studied at 5, 10, 15 and 30 min. Competitive inhibition studies were performed by  intravenous administration of [(3)H] glycylsarcosine with and without various  inhibitors. Concentration-dependent ocular uptake of glycylsarcosine was carried  out by administration of various concentrations of unlabelled glycylsarcosine  spiked with a fixed amount of [(3)H] glycylsarcosine. Time-dependent uptake of  glycylsarcosine into vitreous humor, retina and aqueous humor for a period of 30  min following systemic administration was linear. Ocular uptake of  glycylsarcosine was inhibited by peptide transporter substrates such as  dipeptides (glycylproline and carnosine) and captopril but not by non-substrates  such as amino acids. Concentration-dependent self-inhibition of glycylsarcosine  ocular uptake was also observed. The results indicate that model dipeptide is  transported across blood-ocular barriers via a carrier-mediated process. In  conclusion, an oligopeptide transport system is involved in the transport of  glycylsarcosine across blood-ocular barriers. This information may be utilized to  design transporter/receptor targeted drug delivery systems for efficient ocular  uptake from systemic administration.","2004-04","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","815-822","","4","78","","Exp Eye Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15037116","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Intravenous; Biological Transport; Dipeptides/*pharmacokinetics; Blood-Retinal Barrier/*physiology; Vitreous Body/metabolism; Aqueous Humor/metabolism; Retina/metabolism; Blood-Aqueous Barrier/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Invasive monitoring revealed hyperdynamic  shock with decreased systemic vascular resistances. DISCUSSION: Nifedipine is  metabolized by isoenzyme CYP3A4. This metabolic pathway is inhibited by  clarithromycin, thus potentially increasing the plasma nifedipine concentration,  which may lead to excessive calcium-channel blocker effects. Clinical  manifestations of excessive calcium-channel blockade comprise hypotension or  vasodilatory shock and heart block, as in our case. An objective causality  assessment revealed that this drug interaction was the possible cause of these  adverse effects. Because of an initial diagnosis of septic shock, suspicion of  this entity was delayed and specific diagnostic and treatment were not possible.

Generally, ACE inhibitors are used for the cardiovascular disorders. ACE  inhibitors are primary agents for the management of hypertension, so these cannot  be avoided for further use. The present Review focuses on the implications of  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in neurodegenerative disorders such as  dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease,  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy. ACE inhibitors  such as ramipril, captopril, perindopril, quinapril, lisinopril, enalapril, and  trandolapril have been documented to ameliorate the above neurodegenerative  disorders. Neurodegeneration occurs not only by angiotensin II, but also by other  endogenous factors, such as the formation of free radicals, amyloid beta, immune  reactions, and activation of calcium dependent enzymes. ACE inhibitors interact  with the above cellular mechanisms. Thus, these may act as a promising factor for  future medicine for neurological disorders beyond the cardiovascular actions.  Central acting ACE inhibitors can be useful in the future for the management of  neuropathic pain due to following actions: (i) ACE-2 converts angiotensinogen to  angiotensin(1-7) (hepatapeptide) which produces neuroprotective action; (ii) ACE  inhibitors downregulate kinin B1 receptors in the peripheral nervous system which  is responsible for neuropathic pain. However, more extensive research is required  in the field of neuropathic pain for the utilization of ACE inhibitors in human.","2015-04-15","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","508-521","","4","6","","ACS Chem Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25680080","","","","Humans; Animals; hypertension; Alzheimer’s disease; Angiotensin converting enzyme; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; neurodegeneration; Neurodegenerative Diseases/*drug therapy/enzymology; neuropathic pain; Neuroprotective Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/metabolism; ramipril","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, bradykinin  caused a transient increase in the release of previously incorporated [3H]  noradrenaline from primary cultures of dissociated rat sympathetic neurons. When  this effect was abolished by tetrodotoxin, bradykinin caused an inhibition of  tritium overflow triggered by depolarizing K+ concentrations. This inhibition was  additive to that caused by the alpha2-adrenergic agonist UK 14304, desensitized  within 12 min, was insensitive to pertussis toxin, and was enhanced when protein  kinase C was inactivated. The effect was half maximal at 4 nm and antagonized  competitively by the B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor  indomethacin and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril did not  alter the inhibition by bradykinin. The M-type K+ channel opener retigabine  attenuated the secretagogue action of bradykinin, but left its inhibitory action  unaltered. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, bradykinin reduced  voltage-activated Ca2+ currents in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner, and this  action was additive to the inhibition by UK 14304. These results demonstrate that  bradykinin inhibits noradrenaline release from rat sympathetic neurons via  presynaptic B2 receptors. This effect does not involve cyclooxygenase products,  M-type K+ channels, or protein kinase C, but rather an inhibition of  voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.","2005-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1110-1121","","5","93","","J Neurochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15934932","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Time Factors; Cells, Cultured; Electric Conductivity; Signal Transduction/physiology; Carbamates/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology; Electric Stimulation; Protein Kinase C/metabolism; Potassium/pharmacology; Bradykinin/*pharmacology; Calcium Channels/physiology; Enzyme Activation/physiology; Ganglia, Sympathetic/*metabolism; Neurons/*metabolism; Norepinephrine/*antagonists & inhibitors; Phenylenediamines/pharmacology; Potassium Channels/drug effects/metabolism; Presynaptic Terminals/*metabolism; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2/metabolism; Tritium/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe  hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood  pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic)  [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood  pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had  occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The  dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once  daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further  studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril  can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials,  spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with  enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with  hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium  antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an  adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small  studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients  with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance  mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a  predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active  metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in  this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data  regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective  antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are  needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and  a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in  hypertensive patients with renal failure.","1995-05","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","750-766","","5","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7601014","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since all of the AII antagonists  are selective for the AT(1) receptor, these drugs should exhibit similar  cardiovascular effects. However, since the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  profiles of these agents and their degree of affinity for the AT(1) receptor  differ, it is likely that differences in clinical profiles between these drugs  exist and will require investigation. Losartan (parent compound), has moderate  affinity for the AT(1) receptor (competitive inhibition). Losartan is  well-absorbed orally as an active drug and is rapidly converted via oxidation in  the human liver to a more potent metabolite (designated E3174) with an affinity  20- to 30-times greater for the AT(1) receptor (non-competitive inhibition).  E3174 has a half-life of 6 - 9 h; elimination is via renal and hepatic routes.

The development of several classes of tightly binding competitive inhibitors of  ACE has led to increased understanding of the structure and function of this  enzyme while also yielding important new drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of  hypertensive disease. Peptides from snake venom provided the first proof of the  therapeutic utility of ACE inhibitors, and a tripeptide sequence, Phe-Ala-Pro,  was used as a model for sidechain interactions with ACE in the rational design of  simpler nonpeptidic inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril. These and more  recently developed ACE inhibitors can be classified according to their structural  analogy to dipeptides or tripeptides and according to the nature of their  zinc-binding ligands, such as sulfhydryl, ketone, carboxylate, or  hydroxyphosphinyl, that contribute greatly to their binding to ACE. Several newer  ACE inhibitors have increased potency and/or improved pharmacokinetic properties  due to modifications such as substitution of the proline ring or replacement of  the methyl side chain analogous to Ala by an aminobutyl residue analogous to Lys.  The availability of structurally diverse ACE inhibitors with great potency and  specificity provides a powerful biochemical tool for purification, localization,  and characterization of ACE in different tissues, and for distinguishing related  zinc metallopeptidases with similar properties.","1987","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","S17-30","","","10 Suppl 7","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2485059","","","","Humans; Animals; Drug Design; Peptides/pharmacology; Dipeptides/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/isolation & purification; Proline/chemistry; Snake Venoms/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main  pharmacogenomics recommendation in this field is to assess CFTR variants for  using ivacaftor and its combination. The drugs' labels for arformoterol,  indacaterol, and umeclidinium indicate a lack of influence of genetic variants in  the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Further studies should evaluate the  contribution of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 variants for formoterol. In addition, there  are reports of potential pharmacogenetic variants in the treatment with  acetylcysteine (TOLLIP rs3750920) and captopril (ACE rs1799752). The genetic  variations for warfarin also are presented in PharmGKB and CPIC for patients with  pulmonary hypertension.

DATA SOURCES: A search  of the literature was performed using MEDLINE (1966-September 2006), EMBASE Drugs  and Pharmacology (1980-September 2006), and Current Contents/Clinical Medicine  (week 24, 2005-week 30, 2006). Package inserts from lercanidipine, nifedipine,  felodipine, and amlodipine were also reviewed for comparison of adverse effects.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were limited to clinical trials,  abstracts, and review articles published in English. DATA SYNTHESIS:  Lercanidipine is a novel dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium-channel blocker indicated  for the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. Although it is not yet  available in the US, lercanidipine has been utilized extensively in other  countries. In 2 randomized controlled trials of approximately 400 patients with  mild-to-moderate hypertension, lercanidipine showed efficacy similar to that of 2  other DHPs, felodipine and slow-release nifedipine, in significantly reducing  systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 4 weeks. In a  longer trial (12 mo), lercanidipine 10 mg/day led to normalized blood pressure in  49% of patients after 4 weeks. A postmarketing trial of 9050 patients  corroborated the results observed in previous clinical trials, with 64% of  patients achieving a DBP of less than 90 mm Hg and 32% attaining blood pressure  control (<140/90 mm Hg). In elderly patients, lercanidipine was found comparable  with lacidipine and nifedipine, showing similar decreases in DBP when compared  with nifedipine (-18.3 vs -17.7 mm Hg, respectively). What distinguishes  lercanidipine from other members of the DHP class is its lower incidence of  adverse effects, particularly edema. One study showed that fewer patients  withdrew secondary to adverse drug reactions in the lercanidipine (0.9%) and  nifedipine (3.8%) group compared with the felodipine (4.5%) group. Lercanidipine  has also shown efficacy similar to that of other antihypertensives, including  atenolol, captopril, and losartan. CONCLUSIONS: Lercanidipine may be an option in  the treatment of hypertension, as current literature suggests comparable  antihypertensive efficacy and better tolerability. Further randomized,  double-blind clinical trials must be conducted in order to clarify its position  among other antihypertensive medications.","2007-03","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","465-473","","3","41","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17341540","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Dihydropyridines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Calcium Channel Blockers/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on these data, different levels of blood pressure are  defined: normal blood pressure, borderline hypertension, confirmed hypertension  and life threatening hypertension. The confirmation of a renovascular disease as  the cause of a child's hypertension is based on the elevation of the peripheral  plasma renin level, the captopril tests, possibly the renal vein renin  determinations and the imaging studies. The medical management is based on the  use of antihypertensive drugs: diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, beta  blockers, a blockers, converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotension II receptor  antagonists.

The saphenous vein grafts evaluated  histopathologically displayed a loss in their endothelium up to a ratio of 30%  and set forth indications of functional deterioration. The pharmacological  evaluations proved that the relaxation responses induced by fluvastatin and  pravastatin were significantly inhibited by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor,  N(G)-nitro-l-arginine, and cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, while these  responses were significantly increased by angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632. The  results of immunochemical studies are in accordance with the results of the  pharmacological studies that the related statins increased the levels of nitric  oxide, phospholipase A(2) and they decreased the levels of angiotensin II and  active rho kinase. On the other hand mevalonolactone, a substrate of lipid  metabolism, failed to change the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin in the  related tissue. The experimental results indicate that activation of nitric oxide  synthase and phospholipase A(2)-cyclooxygenase pathway and inhibition of  angiotensin converting enzyme and rho kinase may have a role on the effects of  fluvastatin and pravastatin in the human saphenous vein grafts.

Levamisole  was previously approved in combination with fluorouracil for the treatment of  colon cancer; however, the drug was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2000  because of the frequent occurrence of agranulocytosis. The detection of  autoantibodies such as antithrombin (lupus anticoagulant) and an increased risk  of agranulocytosis in patients carrying the human leukocyte antigen B27 genotype  suggest that toxicity is immune-mediated. In this perspective, we provide an  historical account of the levamisole/cocaine story as it first surfaced in 2008,  including a succinct review of levamisole pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and  preclinical/clinical evidence for levamisole-induced agranulocytosis. Based on  the available information on levamisole metabolism in humans, we propose that  reactive metabolite formation is the rate-limiting step in the etiology of  agranulocytosis associated with levamisole, in a manner similar to other drugs  (e.g., propylthiouracil, methimazole, captopril, etc.) associated with blood  dyscrasias. Finally, considering the toxicity associated with levamisole, we  propose that the 2,3,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole scaffold found in  levamisole be categorized as a new structural alert, which is to be avoided in  drug design.","2012-06","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","1067-1075","","6","40","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22393119","","","","Humans; Animals; United States; *Drug Contamination; Agranulocytosis/*chemically induced/*immunology/*metabolism; Cocaine/chemistry/*metabolism/poisoning; Levamisole/chemistry/*metabolism/poisoning; United States Public Health Service/legislation & jurisprudence; Veterinary Drugs/chemistry/metabolism/poisoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lisinopril, a new nonsulfhydryl  angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is absorbed in its active form.  Like the other ACE inhibitors, it lowers peripheral vascular resistance, with a  resultant decrease in blood pressure. Approximately 29% of lisinopril is absorbed  after oral administration. No measurable metabolism occurs, and excretion is  primarily renal. Accumulation of lisinopril occurs in patients with renal  dysfunction; however, dosage adjustment is necessary only when the creatinine  clearance is less than 30 mL/min. Lisinopril has been shown to be an effective  antihypertensive agent at doses of 10 to 80 mg given once daily in patients with  essential and secondary hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis. The  effectiveness of lisinopril is comparable to that with diuretics, beta blockers,  and calcium-channel antagonists. In patients who are unresponsive to maximal  doses of lisinopril alone, addition of another antihypertensive agent may be  beneficial. Limited information suggests that lisinopril may be comparable to  captopril for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Adverse effects  associated with lisinopril are relatively minor and are comparable to those  associated with enalapril. Hematological abnormalities have not been reported  with lisinopril. Class-related adverse effects include cough, azotemia,  angioedema, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Lisinopril appears to be comparable to  other ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and may be as effective as  its predecessors for the treatment of congestive heart failure.

In several studies of the combination of terazosin plus a diuretic  (hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, amiloride,  triamterene, metolazone, or spironolactone), significant decreases in one or more  of the blood pressure variables studied were demonstrated (compared with diuretic  plus placebo). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of terazosin plus  atenolol, supine and standing blood pressures decreased significantly from  baseline (atenolol monotherapy) after the addition of terazosin but not placebo.  In a study of terazosin added to background therapy (including beta-blockers,  diuretics, methyldopa, clonidine, captopril, guanethidine, hydralazine, and  nifedipine), the addition of terazosin resulted in significant decreases in  supine and standing diastolic blood pressures compared with baseline values  (background therapy alone). Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin  and verapamil reduced blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than  either agent alone. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results indicate that terazosin  did not alter the metabolism of verapamil. No significant abnormal laboratory  test results have been reported for patients taking terazosin in combination with  other antihypertensive agents; in fact some evidence suggests that terazosin may  attenuate adverse lipid, glucose, and potassium changes associated with thiazide  diuretics. Adverse experiences associated with terazosin combination therapy are  usually mild to moderate.

Reflections and suggestions].","La Clinica terapeutica","","0009-9074","","","Treatment of arterial hypertension is an important part of medical care provided in industrialized countries today. When non-drug treatment turns out to be  ineffective, or when hypertension levels are higher than target values, or target  organ damage is ascertained, drug therapy must be started. This rationale comes  from large-scale intervention trials, which have shown that the lowering of  elevated blood pressure reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A logical  aim in treatment of hypertension should be both to ""normalize""  hypertension-induced cardiovascular abnormalities and to maintain the quality of  life, without undesirable influence on other cardiovascular risks. Moreover, if  we could identify the major hemodynamic impairment behind increased blood  pressure and correct it by an appropriate drug therapy, then we would have a  satisfactory means to perform individualized treatment. Over the past years the  empirical basis for the use of antihypertensive drugs has been replaced by a  step-wise approach, but few attempts have been made to provide an approach that  fits pathophysiological understanding. For this reason the above-mentioned  step-wise approach has been found to be an uncorrected simplification of  antihypertensive care. Also, the use of more recent drugs (calcium channel  blockers, ACE-inhibitors and serotonin-receptor blockers) as an alternative to  beta-blockers and diuretics in first step therapy, has further contributed to the  abandonment of the step-wise approach. The different groups of antihypertensive  agents are examined with reference to their mechanism of action,  pharmacokinetics, indications, and desirable and untoward effects. At present,  indirect vasodilators, such as calcium-antagonists, ACE-inhibitors and  serotonin-receptor blockers, alone or combined with diuretics, represent an  intrinsic part of basic antihypertensive therapy. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists  remain the agents of choice when the principal therapeutic aim is to reduce the  adrenergic drive. Both these drugs and direct vasodilators or alpha-adrenoceptor  antagonists can be employed in the most severe forms of hypertension. In such  cases, combined therapy (vasodilator + antiadrenergic + diuretic agents) is often  used. Sublingual nifedipine and intravenous diazoxide or sodium nitroprusside are  the drugs of choice for the hypertensive crisis. The use of most of the central  or peripheral sympatholytic agents has generally been abandoned. Finally,  beta-blockers and calcium-antagonists have been shown to have a secure place in  the management of ischemic heart disease complicating arterial hypertension. In  this condition captopril also appears to be useful.","1989-05-31","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","299-313","","4","129","","Clin Ter","","","","","","","","ita","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 2527124","","","","Humans; Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of angiotensin II  is mediated via the angiotensin type I receptor (AT1 ) resulting in  vasoconstriction, sodium retention and myocyte growth changes. This causes  myocardial remodeling which eventually leads to left ventricular hypertrophy,  dilation and dysfunction. Inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction has been shown to  reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin receptor blockers  (ARBs) specifically inhibit the AT1 receptor. It has not been known until the  performance of the VALIANT (valsartan in acute myocardial infarction trial)  whether blockade of the angiotensin receptor with an ARB or combination of an ACE  inhibitor and ARB leads to similar outcomes as an ACE inhibitor. The VALIANT  trial demonstrated equal efficacy and non-inferiority of the ARB valsartan 160 mg  bid compared with captopril 50 mg tds, when administered to high risk patients  with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure in the immediate post  myocardial infarction period. The combination therapy showed no incremental  benefit over ACE inhibition or an ARB alone and resulted in increased adverse  effects. This review examines the role of valsartan in left ventricular  dysfunction post myocardial infarction. We also discuss pharmacokinetics, dosing,  side effects, and usage in the elderly.","2007","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","425-430","","4","3","","Vasc Health Risk Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 17969373  PMCID: PMC2291334","","","","Humans; Treatment Outcome; Valsartan; Drug Therapy, Combination; Tetrazoles/*therapeutic use; Valine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Renin-Angiotensin System/physiology; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Myocardial Infarction/*complications; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/therapeutic use; Angiotensin II/physiology; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frequency-domain spectral analysis of stationary ECG R-R intervals was made by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) in conditions of monitored arterial blood  pressure and respiratory activity in diethyl-ether-anaesthetized and pithed adult  rats. This technique yields a number of parameters which allow quantitative  evaluation of the non-random distribution of the mean values obtained in  time-domain studies. The frequency-analysis method enables the overall heart rate  variability to be broken down into its various constituents, which are  differently affected by physiological loading and capable of selective reactivity  to pharmacological agents. 2. The low-frequency spectral component obtained by  breaking down the total spectral density power, i.e. the appropriate variability  signal (band width < 0.15 Hz) and a higher-frequency band corresponding to  spontaneous (0.80-1.60 Hz) or artificially imposed (0.75 Hz) respiratory activity  were estimated and their integrated areas evaluated as absolute powers or  normalized fractional values. 3. The power of the high-frequency spectral  component increased in all animal preparations under treatment with prazosin,  dl-propranolol, endothelin-1 and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors captopril, lisinopril, quinapril and ramipril. The power of the  low-frequency band increased under alpha-r atriopeptin and ACE inhibitors in the  pithed preparations only, and decreased in the anaesthetized animals. 4. The new  power spectrum features and trends detected indicate that these time-independent,  model-dependent cardiovascular and respiratory markers are subject to some form  of complex peptidergic control. 5. The relative roles of the various factors  operating in the genesis of these short-term changes in spectral power in the  low- and high-frequency bands cannot be interpreted as indicating a reciprocal  push-pull relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. 6. The  study findings, however, can be interpreted as providing evidence of a different  and to some extent alternative form of integrative cardiovascular control  persisting in the pithed rats (i.e. in the 'peripheral', CNS-destroyed  preparations). 7. New areas of theoretical and applied research are being  developed in the (auto)classification of (iso)receptors and drug analogues  through exploration of multiple physiological and pharmacokinetic parameters in  the frequency-domain. Furthermore, model-independent frequency-domain methods not  requiring stationary data will afford scope for even more significant  developments by separating the overlapping dynamic processes from a whole series  of correlated effects.","1998-10","2023-10-27 12:57:53","2023-10-27 12:57:53","","271-280","","5","18","","J Auton Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9831227","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Heart Rate/*drug effects; Electrocardiography/methods; Propranolol/*pharmacology; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/*pharmacology; Endothelin-1/*pharmacology; Ether/pharmacology; Prazosin/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
