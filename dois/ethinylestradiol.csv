An update","Clinical Pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199120010-00002","","The present article should be read in conjunction with the original review published in the Journal in 1983. There is no new information of major significance about the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel, norethisterone (norethindrone) or ethinylestradiol, although it has been shown that the concentrations of these hormones secreted in breast milk are small and mothers taking combined oral contraceptive steroids may breast-feed safely. Both levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol can be successfully administered from appropriate vaginal formulations, but no clear advantages over oral administration have been demonstrated. Several new progestogens have been investigated. Desogestrel is a prodrug for its active metabolite 3-keto-desogestrel, gestodene is itself an active progestogen and norgestimate is a prodrug acting by conversion to norgestrel and its metabolites. All 3 compounds have good bioavailability with wide intersubject variation. The newer progestogens, like norethisterone and levonorgestrel, are bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). This causes their plasma concentrations to increase with time, since SHBG is induced by ethinylestradiol even in doses of 30 micrograms daily. The binding capacity and affinity of SHBG do not increase in direct proportion to its concentration. Further drug interactions with oral contraceptive steroids have been described. Contraceptive steroids may inhibit hepatic microsomal enzyme metabolism and increase the plasma concentration and effect of some tricyclic antidepressants, the hydroxylated benzodiazepines, some beta-blocking drugs, methylxanthines, prednisolone and cyclosporin. There are no significant effects on vitamins. Oral contraceptive steroids induce glucuronidation and hence decrease plasma concentrations of some benzodiazepines, clofibric acid, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and possibly morphine. The plasma concentration of ethinylestradiol may be increased by competitive sulphation with paracetamol. Plasma concentrations of contraceptive steroids are decreased by griseofulvin, which induces their hepatic metabolism. The role of other antibiotics remains controversial but there is probably a group of susceptible women who have lower plasma contraceptive hormone concentrations and experience breakthrough bleeding or pregnancy when given broad spectrum antibiotics. This may relate to interruption of the enterohepatic recirculation of ethinylestradiol. Anticonvulsants, other than valproic acid, all induce contraceptive steroid metabolism and therefore lower plasma hormone concentrations, thus reducing contraceptive effectiveness.","1991-01","2023-08-21 20:18:05","2023-09-01 10:38:37","","15-37","","1","20","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 2029800","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2029800","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Pregnancy; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*pharmacokinetics; Steroids/pharmacokinetics","Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal; Steroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is not known if bariatric surgery affects the  pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to  evaluate ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) absorption in women  undergoing RYGB, compared with nonoperated controls matched by age and body mass  index (BMI). A secondary objective was to assess whether the time since surgery  and BMI in the postoperative period influenced the absorption parameters.  SETTING: University hospital, Brazil. METHODS: This study was designed to compare  the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), the time to the peak plasma level  (T(max)), the area under the curve (AUC(0-8) and AUC(0-∞)) after a single dose of  a combined oral contraceptive with 0.03 mg EE and 0.15 mg LNG among 20 women  after RYGB and 20 controls. Blood samples were obtained for 8 hours. RESULTS: The  mean LNG AUC(0-8) and LNG AUC(0-∞) were higher in RYGB group (P = .048 and P =  .004, respectively). We found a positive correlation for LNG AUC(0-8) (P = .045)  and AUC(0-∞) (P = .004) and the time since surgery, and we found a negative  correlation for LNG C(max) (P = .018), AUC(0-8) (P = .003), and AUC(0-∞) (P =  .001) and BMI. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found in oral EE  pharmacokinetics. The operated group showed higher mean LNG AUC(0-8) and AUC(0-∞)  but it was not considered clinically significant. The present study suggests that  RYGB may not affect EE and LNG absorption.","2021-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:11","","673-681","","4","17","","Surg Obes Relat Dis","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Each participant received oral contraceptives daily  for 21 days for the first control cycle, then was randomized to one of two  sequences to receive oral contraceptives with concomitant rifampicin and  rifabutin at equal doses of 300 mg/day for 10 days. Ethinylestradiol,  norethindrone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH),  progesterone, rifampicin, and rifabutin (and metabolite) were measured in plasma  over the same time frames in all three cycles. Safety was assessed from before  the beginning to the end of each cycle. Twenty-two subjects completed all three  cycles. Compared with the control cycle, rifabutin and rifampicin significantly  altered the disposition of the oral contraceptive. Area under the  concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) and maximum plasma  concentration (Cmax) of ethinylestradiol decreased by 64% and 42%, respectively,  after coadministration with rifampicin and by 35% and 20%, respectively, after  coadministration with rifabutin. The AUC0-24 of norethindrone decreased by 60%  and 20% after coadministration with rifampicin and rifabutin, respectively.  Unlike progesterone levels, FSH and LH levels increased during coadministration  with rifampicin and rifabutin. The incidence of spotting was significantly higher  after coadministration with rifampicin (36.4%) and rifabutin (21.7%) than during  the control cycle (3.7%). Although both rifampicin and rifabutin affected the  pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol and norethindrone, the magnitude of this  effect was more pronounced with rifampicin. Likewise, the fact that the highest  incidence of spotting occurred with rifampicin was consistent with higher  metabolic induction by rifampicin. Despite the fact that there was no change in  progesterone levels, it is recommended that patients be advised to use additional  contraceptive methods while receiving rifabutin or rifampicin with oral  contraceptives to prevent inadvertent pregnancy.","1998-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:25","","1042-1050","","11","38","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9824786","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/*pharmacokinetics; Fever/chemically induced; Luteinizing Hormone/blood/drug effects; Neutropenia/chemically induced; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Rifampin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Rilpivirine metabolism involves  cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). This trial (ClinicalTrials. gov number:  NCT00739622) evaluated the interaction between rilpivirine and  ethinylestradiol/norethindrone (combination oral contraceptives), which are  metabolized by multiple pathways, including CYP3A4. METHODS: During three  consecutive 28-day cycles, 18 HIV-negative females received once-daily  ethinylestradiol (35 μg)/norethindrone (1 mg) (Days 1 - 21); Days 22 - 28 were  pill-free. Only in Cycle 3 was once-daily rilpivirine (25 mg) co-administered  (Days 1 - 15). Minimum and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmin; Cmax) and area  under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC24h) of  ethinylestradiol/norethindrone (Day 15, Cycles 2 and 3) and rilpivirine (Day 15,  Cycle 3) were evaluated. RESULTS: Rilpivirine coadministration had no effect on  (least square mean ratio, 90% confidence interval) ethinylestradiol Cmin (1.09,  1.03 - 1.16) or AUC24h (1.14, 1.10 - 1.19), but increased Cmax by 17% (1.17, 1.06  - 1.30), which is unlikely to affect ethinylestradiol pharmacodynamics.  Norethindrone pharmacokinetics were unaffected by rilpivirine (AUC24h: 0.89, 0.84  - 0.94; Cmin: 0.99, 0.90 - 1.08; Cmax: 0.94, 0.83 - 1.06). Steady-state  rilpivirine pharmacokinetics with ethinylestradiol/norethindrone was comparable  with historical data for rilpivirine alone. Rilpivirine with  ethinylestradiol/norethindrone was generally well tolerated. No new safety events  were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of rilpivirine, at the  therapeutic dosing regimen, with ethinylestradiol/norethindrone does not affect  hormone pharmacokinetics, and is, therefore, unlikely to affect the efficacy or  safety of this oral hormonal contraceptive. Rilpivirine pharmacokinetics was not  affected by ethinylestradiol/norethindrone. Rilpivirine (25 mg once daily) can be  co-administered with ethinylestradiol/norethindrone-based contraceptives without  dose modification.","2014-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:27:07","","118-128","","2","52","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 24161160","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Healthy Volunteers; Drug Combinations; Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology; Rilpivirine; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Nitriles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Norethindrone/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blood was sampled sequentially following single oral doses and the plasma  separated for analysis of NET and EE2 by specific radioimmunoassays. Comparisons  of both drugs following a dose in solution and tablets were made with respect to  the following parameters: (a) plasma concentrations at each sample time; (b)  maximum plasma concentration (Cpmax); (c) time to maximum plasma concentration  (Tmax); (d) total area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), and  (e) plasma half-life (t1/2). It was found that the tablet and solution doses were  bioequivalent with respect to EE2 absorption. However, absorption of NET from  solution and tablet doses exhibited significant differences with respect to  plasma levels at certain time points as well as AUC (which were higher following  the tablet dose), but Cpmax, Tmax and t1/2 were not significantly different.  Pharmacokinetic analysis of both drugs following the tablet dose was carried out  using a two-compartment open model. The absorption rate constant (ka) and  peripheral to central compartment transfer rate constant (k21) were similar for  NET and EE2, but statistically significant differences were observed with respect  to the distribution rate constant (alpha), the central to peripheral transfer  rate constant (k12), the overall elimination rate constant (ke1), and volume of  distribution (V1/F). The elimination rate constant (beta) for both drugs showed a  difference of borderline statistical significance.","1983-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:58","","241-251","","3","28","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6641224","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Kinetics; Middle Aged; Body Weight; Age Factors; Tablets; Radioimmunoassay; Solutions; Adsorption; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Contraception; *Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen; *Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; *Ethinyl Estradiol--administraction and dosage; *Ethinyl Estradiol--analysis; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; *Laboratory Procedures; *Norethindrone--administraction and dosage; *Norethindrone--analysis; *Norethindrone--pharmacodynamics; *Reproductive Control Agents; Contraceptive Agents--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Female--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*blood; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The constituents of  the preparations were as follows: Gravistat (0.05 mg EE2, 0.125 mg LNG);  Minisiston (0.03 mg EE2, 0.125 mg LNG). In 20 of the volunteers blood samples  were taken before and up to 36 hours following the intake of a single table. In  11 women the investigation was carried out at day 21 of a treatment cycle  (steady-state condition). In spite of pronounced interindividual variations of  the pharmacokinetic data, a clear dependency of EE2 concentration curves on the  estrogen dose of the respective preparation could be demonstrated. Under the  condition of steady-state (21st day of administration) there was a slight but  significant rise of the EE2 peak serum concentrations and a pronounced increase  of the LNG levels, closely reflected by elevation of the AUC values. SHBG serum  concentration was significantly increased by the 10th day of treatment in all  subjects receiving Gravistat, whereas the mean value in the Minisiston-group did  not remarkably change. Although LNG is known to be bound to SHBG with high  affinity, the missing parallelism between LNG- and SHBG-concentrations suggests  other (additional?) mechanisms for the elevated LNG-binding capacity in women  taking combined EE2-LNG preparations.","1992","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:41","","12-17","","1","99","","Exp Clin Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 1628691","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Protein Binding; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Contraception; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Ethinyl Estradiol-Norgestrel Combination; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--analysis; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; *Levonorgestrel--analysis; *Levonorgestrel--pharmacodynamics; *Oral Contraceptives--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Methods--administraction and dosage; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*administration & dosage; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Norgestrel/*administration & dosage; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/analysis/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As reference, an  oral preparation containing 150 micrograms desogestrel and 30 micrograms  ethinylestradiol (MarvelonR tablets) was also administered to the volunteers. To  assess the disposition parameters of 3-keto-desogestrel and ethinylestradiol,  some of the volunteers were additionally given an i.v. preparation containing 150  micrograms 3-keto-desogestrel and 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol. Serum levels  obtained with CVRs showed an initial increase during the first three days,  followed by a plateau decreasing only slightly during the remainder of the  treatment period. Mean plateau levels (+/- s.d.) of 3-keto-desogestrel were 2.3  +/- 0.9, 2.8 +/- 1.1 and 3.8 +/- 1.1 pmol/ml for CVR 75/15, 100/15 and 150/15,  respectively.

RESULTS: When combined  with etravirine, the least-squares means (LSM) ratios (90% confidence interval)  for ethinylestradiol AUC(24h), C(max) and C(min) were 1.22 (1.13-1.31), 1.33  (1.21-1.46) and 1.09 (1.01-1.18), respectively, compared to administration alone.  LSM ratios for norethindrone parameters were 0.95 (0.90-0.99), 1.05 (0.98-1.12)  and 0.78 (0.68-0.90), respectively. CONCLUSION: These changes are not considered  clinically relevant. No loss in contraceptive efficacy is expected when  coadministered with etravirine.","2009-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:17","","44-52","","1","80","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19501215","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Young Adult; Pyrimidines; Nitriles; Anti-HIV Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Pyridazines/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were great interindividual variations, but during treatment with EE/GSD the  EE levels were higher and the EE peaks occurred by 30 min later than during  treatment with EE/DG. The areas under the EE serum concentration-versus-time  curves (AUC) between 0 and 4 h were higher by 37% (p less than 0.03) and between  0 and 24 h higher by 70% (p less than 0.002) during treatment with EE/GSD. During  each treatment cycle, the EE levels rose between day 1 and 10. The serum levels  of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), which is known to be influenced only by  the estrogenic component of the combination pill, increased significantly (p less  than 0.01) during each treatment cycle. CBG was elevated on day 21 of the 6th and  12th cycle by 150 to 155% and by 120 to 130% with EE/GSD and EE/DG, respectively.  The difference between the two drugs was significant (p less than 0.02). During  the pill-free intervals of 7 days between the treatment cycles, the CBG levels  decreased but were still elevated by 85% with EE/GSD and 50% with EE/DG at the  beginning of the following cycle as compared to the control cycle. The serum  levels of cortisol were also significantly more elevated (p less than 0.05)  during treatment with EE/GSD as compared to EE/DG. Despite the same EE dose  during treatment, the higher EE levels with EE/GSD as compared to EE/DG seem to  be due to a retardation of the inactivation and elimination of EE caused by the  progestogen component. The rise in the EE levels during each cycle seems to be  due to a reduction in the oxidative metabolism by EE itself.","1989-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:31:33","","299-312","","3","40","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2527727","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Menstrual Cycle; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*pharmacokinetics; Desogestrel; Norpregnenes/pharmacokinetics; Progestins/*pharmacokinetics; Transcortin/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, oral contraceptive drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies usually  characterize metabolite pharmacokinetics, with changes typically attributed to  modulation of metabolism. EE passively diffuses through plasma membranes, but its  conjugates are hydrophilic and require active transport. Unlike EE metabolism,  EEG and EES transport has not been explored in vivo as a potential mechanism of  DDIs. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that EEG is transported by multidrug  resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2 and MRP3 and EES is a breast cancer  resistance protein (BCRP) substrate. In the study presented here,  pharmacokinetics of EE and conjugates were studied in TR⁻ rats, which lack Mrp2,  have marginal hepatic Bcrp expression, and overexpress hepatic Mrp3. EE  pharmacokinetics in TR⁻ rats were comparable to wild type; however, EEG and EES  systemic exposures were altered markedly. EEG exposure was greatly increased:  20-fold and >100-fold after intravenous and oral EE administration, respectively.  In contrast, EES exposure was lower in TR⁻ rats: 65% decreased (intravenously)  and 83% decreased (orally). In intestinal and liver perfusions, EE intestinal  permeability and metabolism and hepatic clearance were unchanged in TR⁻ rats;  however, secretion of EEG into intestinal lumen was halved, EEG was not detected  in TR⁻ bile, and EES biliary excretion was 98% decreased. After oral EE  administration to Mrp2- and Bcrp-knockout mice, EEG exposure increased 46- and  2-fold, respectively, whereas EES concentrations were decreased modestly. In  conclusion, altered efflux transport resulted in major alterations of EEG and EES  pharmacokinetics, highlighting transport as a potential site of DDIs with EE  conjugates.","2011-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:42:23","","1794-1800","","10","39","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21708882","","","","Administration, Oral; Animals; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism; Biliary Tract/metabolism; Biological Transport; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Half-Life; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Liver/metabolism; Male; Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism; Rats; Rats, Wistar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After a wash-out period of one week, the  same preparation was administered during a treatment period of three months.  After single dose administration, maximum concentrations of CPA in the serum were  15.2 +/- 6.6 ng/ml. Post maximum drug levels declined biphasically with  half-lives of 0.8 +/- 0.4 h and 54.0 +/- 26.0 h, respectively. The apparent  clearance was calculated to be 3.6 +/- 0.9 ml x min-1 x kg-1 and the volume of  distribution (Vz) was 986 +/- 4371. The free fraction of CPA was 3.5 +/- 1.9% and  the fractions bound to heat labile proteins and albumin were 4.6 +/- 2.2% and  92.0 +/- 3.5%, respectively. Trough levels of CPA in the serum increased during a  treatment cycle, reaching a steady-state around day 16. An about two-fold  accumulation of CPA was observed, which was less than expected theoretically.  SHBG concentrations in the serum increased by a factor of three during a cycle,  without having any effect on the protein binding of CPA. At the end of treatment  cycle three, the terminal half-life of CPA had increased to a mean value of 78.6  +/- 16.0 h and the volume of distribution to a value of 1304 +/- 427 1. The  apparent clearance showed a small, although significant decrease to a value of  3.0 +/- 0.4 ml x min-1 x kg-1. The observed changes Vz and t 1/2 during the  treatment period were attributed to the distribution of CPA into a deep  compartment and the slow release of the drug from this compartment. The AUC(0-4h)  values of EE2 following single dose administration of the combination oral  contraceptive were found to be 187.5 +/- 79.7 pg x ml-1 x h. On the last day of  cycles one and three, the AUC(0-4h) values were 311.2 +/- 109.3 and 304.8 +/-  121.5 pg x ml-1 x h, respectively, which corresponds to an about 60% increase as  compared to single dose administration. Total and free testosterone  concentrations decreased during treatment cycles one and three by about 39% and  62%, respectively, compared with the corresponding values measured prior to  treatment.","1993-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:08","","557-575","","6","48","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8131397","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Hormones; Biology; Half-Life; Europe; Oral Contraceptives; Physiology; Studies; Germany; Menstrual Cycle; Testosterone/blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Developed Countries; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; Androgens; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; *Clinical Research; *Research Report; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; *Comparative Studies; *Cyproterone Acetate--pharmacodynamics; *Oral Contraceptives, Combined; *Testosterone; Cyproterone Acetate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Endocrine System; Hormone Antagonists; Western Europe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, sponsors of new molecular entities (NMEs) often conduct clinical  studies with priority given to OCs as victims of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A (CYP3A)  induction and inhibition. Such scenarios are reflected in the US Food and Drug  Administration-issued guidance documentation related to OC DDI studies. Although  CYP3A is important, OCs such as EE are metabolized by sulfotransferase 1E1 and  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, expressed in the gut and liver, and so  both can also serve as loci of victim OC DDI. Therefore, for any NME, one should  carefully consider its induction and inhibition profile involving CYP3A4/5,  UGT1A1, and SULT1E1. As DDI perpetrators, available clinical DDI data indicate  that EE-containing OCs can induce (e.g., UGT1A4 and CYP2A6) and inhibit (CYP1A2 ≥  CYP2C19 > CYP3A4/5 > CYP2C8, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9) various CYP forms.  Although available in vitro CYP inhibition data do not explain such a graded  inhibitory effect in vivo, it is hypothesized that EE differentially modulates  CYP expression via potent agonism of the estrogen receptor expressed in the gut  and liver. From the standpoint of the NME as potential OC DDI victim, therefore,  it is important to assess its projected (pre-phase I) or known therapeutic index  and pharmacokinetic profile (fraction absorbed, absolute oral bioavailability,  clearance/extraction class, fraction metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, and  UGT1A4). Such information can enable the prioritization, design, and  interpretation of NME-OC DDI studies.","2022-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1212-1221","","6","111","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 Pfizer Inc.

After a wash-out period of 3 months, 8 of these  women received a single administration of the same formulation. The results  showed that there was an increase in serum trough levels of LNG, reaching  steady-state in the second half of each treatment cycle. The LNG levels achieved  were about 3 to 4 times higher than anticipated on the basis of single dose  administration. At the end of treatment cycles one and three, the terminal  half-life of LNG was in the range of 24-26 h, while a mean value of 20 h was  observed following single dose administration. An EE2-induced increase in the  SHBG concentration of about 50% as compared to pretreatment values was observed  during a treatment cycle. Pretreatment values were reached following the  drug-free interval of 7 days between two cycles.

This  variability is seen in differences between different populations, as well as from  one individual to another. These studies also show variability in area under the  curve and other parameters in the same person from time to time. Such differences  may equal or exceed the differences between low dose (35 micrograms) and  high-dose (50 micrograms) formulations. The levels of plasma ethinyl estradiol  produced by a 50 micrograms dose of mestranol are similar to those from 35  micrograms of ethinyl estradiol. Thus a high-dose pill may be no higher than a  low-dose pill if the nature of the estrogen is not kept in mind.

In particular, our objective was to  examine whether one or both compounds were characterized by an improved oral  bioavailability with less inter-subject variability than EE2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single and multiple doses of CMA (2  mg) and ethinylestradiol (EE; 0.03 mg) were administered to healthy female  volunteers for six menstrual cycles. Plasma concentrations of CMA and EE were  determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Single-dose and steady-state  pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. In a separate study, healthy female  volunteers were given a single 2-mg dose of radiolabeled CMA. Concentrations of  radioactivity in fecal and urine samples were determined via liquid  scintillation. Excretion of total radioactivity was calculated as percentage of  administered dose. RESULTS: Eighteen women completed the repeated-dose study.  Peak plasma concentrations for CMA and EE were reached within 1 and 2 h after  taking the study drug. Peak plasma concentrations of CMA were approximately 1600  pg/mL after single-dose administration and 2000 pg/mL after multiple dosing. CMA  and EE showed linear pharmacokinetics throughout six cycles, with constant trough  values of approximately 400-500 pg/mL for CMA and 20-40 pg/mL for EE. Mass  balance factors were 1.2-1.4 for CMA and 1.6-1.7 for EE, and accumulation factors  were 1.7-2 for CMA and 1.7-1.8 for EE. Mean t(1/2,z) of CMA was approximately 25  h after single dosing and 36-39 h at steady state. In the excretion balance  study, mean dose of CMA recovered was 87.3+/-6.4%, with urinary and fecal  excretion accounting for 45% and 42%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The  pharmacokinetics of CMA and EE is linear after multiple dosing and remains stable  during long-term administration, once steady state is reached. The t(1/2,z) of  CMA was 36-39 h after multiple dosing, which is considerably shorter than the 80  h often quoted in the literature.","2006-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:40:28","","239-244","","3","74","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16904418","","","","*Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/adverse effects; *Isotope Labeling; Adolescent; Adult; Carbon Radioisotopes; Chlormadinone Acetate/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/blood; Feces/chemistry; Female; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Humans; Kidney/metabolism; Kinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physiologically, mestranol ranges from 50% to 100% of the activity of ethinyl  estradiol, depending on the endpoint chosen. Compounds such as these, which are  metabolized with a first-pass effect and are enterohepatically recirculated,  demonstrate large interindividual and intraindividual variability in their  pharmacokinetics. Thus a given dose of ethinyl estradiol in one person may  produce an effect equivalent to a substantially larger (or smaller) dose in  another person. This wide variability confounds efforts to establish tight  dose-response relationships, a point rarely considered in clinical or  epidemiologic studies of these compounds. The circulating levels of ethinyl  estradiol sulfates may be higher than those of free ethinyl estradiol itself. It  has been thought that these sulfates represent a ""reservoir"" of ethinyl  estradiol. Our studies show that this idea is untenable because the half-life of  the sulfates is not long enough for such an effect. Differences in the  pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and mestranol have been observed in studies  of various populations. The reality of these group differences is affirmed by  analyses of urinary metabolite patterns.","1990-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:08","","2114-2119","","6 Pt 2","163","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2256522","","","","Humans; Female; Biological Availability; Nigeria; Research Methodology; Studies; United States; Population; Africa; Asia; Developing Countries; Sri Lanka; *Ethnic Groups; Developed Countries; Contraception; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Demographic Factors; Population Characteristics; Racial Groups; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--analysis; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; *Comparative Studies; *Mestranol--pharmacodynamics; *Cross-cultural Comparisons; Africa South Of The Sahara; Americas; Cultural Background; English Speaking Africa; Mestranol/*pharmacokinetics; North America; Northern America; Southern Asia; Western Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After oral administration, gestodene is  completely absorbed and bioavailable and exhibits dose-linear pharmacokinetics.  During long-term pill use, serum levels of gestodene were four to five times  higher than after single administration, showing a periodic increase from day 1  to day 10 during each cycle. Ultrafiltration studies revealed that 75.3% of total  serum gestodene is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin, 24.1% is bound to  albumin, and only 0.6% is not protein bound. Thus gestodene levels during steady  state are explained by an increase in sex hormone binding-globulin as a result of  concomitant administered ethinyl estradiol and a specific binding of gestodene to  this protein. Serum levels of ethinyl estradiol during single and multiple  administration were identical and were not different from those observed with  another preparation containing 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol.","1990-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:40:26","","1414-1420","","4 Pt 2","163","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2220966","","","","Absorption; Administration, Oral; Biological Availability; Biotransformation; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Female; Humans; Norpregnenes/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Protein Binding; Serum Albumin/metabolism; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was  designed to evaluate whether avosentan influences the pharmacokinetics of steroid  oral contraceptives. METHODS: During a run-in phase, 16 healthy females received  an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg and levonorgestrel 0.15  mg for the first 21 days of a minimum of one menstrual cycle. In a subsequent  double-blind, randomized two menstrual cycle crossover treatment phase, subjects  received either avosentan 25 mg or placebo once daily concomitantly with the oral  contraceptive. Serum ethinylestradiol and plasma levonorgestrel concentrations  were measured on Days 14 and 15 of the two treatment periods for the evaluation  of the 24-hour kinetic parameters, and an additional sample was collected on Day  21 to determine their trough concentrations. Serum progesterone, luteinizing  hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels as well as plasma  avosentan and Ro 68-5925 levels were determined on Days 13, 14, 15 and 21 of each  cycle of the treatment phase. RESULTS: Avosentan had a statistically significant  lowering effect of 9 - 15% on the ethinylestradiol serum concentration levels.  The 90% confidence intervals of the pharmacokinetic parameters did not include 1  or exceeded the 0.8 - 1.25 acceptance range for lack of interaction. The plasma  concentration-time curves and pharmacokinetic parameters of levonor-gestrel were  not statistically different during concomitant treatment with either avosentan or  placebo. Compared to placebo, avosentan lowered the serum concentrations of  progesterone statistically significantly by about 8% and increased slightly the  LH and FSH serum concentrations. Safety and tolerability patterns were comparable  during avosentan and placebo administration. CONCLUSION: Because of the effect of  avosentan on the concentration levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, it is  possible that the contraceptive efficacy of low-dose combination oral  contraceptives may be adversely affected during avosentan treatment.","2006-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:27:37","","668-674","","12","44","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 17190377","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Combinations; Progesterone/blood; Molecular Structure; Headache/chemically induced; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Luteinizing Hormone/blood; Endothelin Receptor Antagonists; Exanthema/chemically induced; Vomiting/chemically induced; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*pharmacokinetics; Facial Injuries/chemically induced; Pyridines/adverse effects/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Pyrimidines/adverse effects/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Rhinitis/chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analyte and the IS were extracted from  acidified plasma by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using diethyl ether-hexane  followed by online solid phase extraction (SPE) using online C18 cartridges.  Extracted samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled  to atmospheric pressure photoionization tandem mass spectrometry  (HPLC-APPI-MS/MS). Chromatography was performed isocratically on a C18, 5 microm  analytical column. The method had a chromatographic run time of 2.50 min and a  linear calibration curve over the range 5-500 pg ml(-1) (r(2)>0.9992). The lowest  concentration quantified was 5 pg ml(-1), demonstrating acceptable accuracy and  precision. The intra-assay precisions ranged from 2.1 to 14.6%, while inter-assay  precisions ranged from 4.4 to 11.4%. The intra-assay accuracies ranged from 94.6  to 103.8%, while the inter-assay accuracies ranged from 98.9 to 101.6%. The  recovery of ethinylestradiol was determined as part of the assay validation  process and was 73.1 and 79.0% for the concentrations 15 and 375 pg ml(-1),  respectively. Short-term stability showed that ethinylestradiol was stable in  plasma for at least 19 h at room temperature or for at least 385 days when stored  at -20 degrees C. In the study of bioequivalence conducted in Brazil, healthy  volunteers received two ethinylestradiol 0.035 mg tablet formulations using an  open, randomized, two-period crossover design with a 2-week washout interval.  Since the 90% confidence interval for C(max) and area under the curve ratios were  all inside the 80-125% interval proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration,  it was concluded that the two ethinylestradiol formulations are bioequivalent  with respect to both the rate and the extent of absorption.","2009-11-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:02","","3601-3609","","29","877","","J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19773204","","","","Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods; Ethinyl Estradiol/*blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the wide use of contraceptives containing EE2, the  pharmacokinetics of its sulfate conjugates are of some importance. In previous  studies of the intermediate metabolism of ethinyl estrogens we have shown that  the baboon is an appropriate animal model. Accordingly, oral and/or intravenous  doses of EE2 or each of its three sulfates were administered to castrate female  baboons, and plasma levels of EE2 and its sulfates were studied by specific  radioimmunoassay or radioisotope counting. After intravenous administration of  EE2, the 3-sulfate and the 3,17-disulfate are the major circulating metabolites.  After oral dosage administration, the 3-glucuronide and, in some cases, the  3,17-diglucuronide also become important. After intravenous administration, about  twice as much of the drug exists in the sulfate as in the free form, as reflected  by the areas under the plasma level curves. The bioavailability of orally  administered EE2 was about 60%, confirming the presence of a substantial  first-pass effect. Hydrolysis at the 17-position occurs when EE2-17-sulfate is  administered orally but appears not to occur with intravenous administration. EE2  and the three sulfates, given intravenously, exhibited two-compartment open-model  kinetics. The elimination phase half-lives of all four compounds were similar,  ranging from 8.8 to 11.2 hours. The area under the plasma level curve of EE2  resulting from the intravenous administration of the 3-sulfate was approximately  8% of the total area under the plasma level curve of both EE2 and EE2 sulfates.  The ratio of the area under the plasma level curve of sulfates resulting from  3-sulfate administration compared to the other two sulfates was approximately  0.3, reflecting the existence of other metabolic pathways for its disposition.","1983-05-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:17","","80-87","","1","146","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6846427","","","","Female; Kinetics; Animals; Administration, Oral; Models, Biological; Half-Life; Injections, Intravenous; Radioimmunoassay; Castration; Papio; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The doses of steroids were given both orally and  by i.v. infusion over 5-7 minutes. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals  over 24 hours. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)  for oral EE2 alone was 867 +/- 338 pg/ml x h, for oral EE2 in the presence of  gestodene it was 795 +/- 206 pg/ml x h and for oral EE2 in the presence of  desogestrel it was 614 +/- 132 pg/ml x h. With either gestodene or desogestrel  present, the AUC of EE2 was not significantly different from that found when EE2  was given alone. In addition, there was no significant difference between EE2 +  gestodene and EE2 + desogestrel. Comparing the relative oral and iv doses, the  bioavailability of EE2 (alone) was 59.0 +/- 13% (n = 6), for EE2 plus gestodene  it was 62.1 +/- 10% and for EE2 in the presence of desogestrel it was 62.1 +/-  4.4%.

Prior to  this treatment period, the same women received a single administration of a  coated tablet containing 0.125 mg LNG together with 0.03 mg EE2. There was a  washout phase of one week between both treatments. Following single dose  administration, a mean terminal half-life of 22 h was observed for LNG. The total  clearance was 1.0 ml x min-1 x kg-1 and the volume of distribution was 128 l.  During a treatment cycle, LNG levels in the serum accumulated by a factor of  about four as compared to single dose administration. Steady-state drug levels  were reached during the second half of each cycle. As compared to single dose  administration, the following changes were observed for LNG at the end of  treatment cycles one and three: reduced total (0.5 ml x min-1 x kg-1) and free  clearance (50 ml x min-1 x kg-1) and a reduced volume of distribution (52 l). A  concomitant increase in the SHBG concentrations by a factor of two as compared to  pretreatment values was observed during treatment and appeared to be mainly  responsible for the changes in the pharmacokinetics of LNG. Marked changes were  also seen for the serum protein binding of LNG. After single dose administration,  the free fraction of LNG was 1.4% and the fractions bound to SHBG and albumin  were 55.0% and 43.6%, respectively. At the end of cycle one, the free fraction  was only 1.0% and the fractions bound to SHBG and albumin were 69.4% and 30.0%,  respectively.

Therefore, sorption to roots, uptake,  translocation, and transformation of 3 estrogens (17β-estradiol,  17α-ethinylestradiol, and zeranol) and 1 androgen (trenbolone acetate) commonly  found in animal manure or biosolids were assessed by hydroponically grown hybrid  poplar, Populus deltoides x nigra, DN-34, widely used in riparian buffer strips.

Removals by sorption to  dead poplar roots that had been autoclaved were significantly less, 71% to 84%.  Major transformation products (estrone and estriol for estradiol; zearalanone for  zeranol; and 17β-trenbolone from trenbolone acetate) were detected in the root  tissues of all 3 poplar treatments. Root concentrations of metabolites peaked  after 1 d to 5 d and then decreased in full and live excised poplars by further  transformation. Metabolite concentrations were less in dead poplar treatments and  only slowly increased without further transformation.

The link between nitrification and biotransformation of  17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was investigated using enriched cultures of  autotrophic ammonia-oxidizers. Batch experiments showed that ring A of EE2 is the  site of electrophilic initiating reactions, including conjugation and  hydroxylation. Ring A was also cleaved before any of the other rings were broken,  which is likely because the frontier electron density of the ring A carbon units  is higher than those of rings B, C, or D. EE2 and NH3 were degraded in the  presence of an ammonium monooxygenase (AMO) containing protein extract, and the  reaction stoichiometry was consistent with a conceptual model involving a  binuclear copper site located at the AMO active site. Continuous tests showed a  linear relationship between nitrification and EE2 removal in enriched nitrifying  cultures. Taken together, these results support the notion that EE2  biotransformation can be cometabolically mediated under operating conditions that  allow for enrichment of nitrifiers.","2007-06-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","4311-4316","","12","41","","Environ Sci Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17626430","","","","Biotransformation; Bioreactors; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Hydroxylation; Water Purification; Nitrogen/*chemistry; Water Microbiology; Acetylene/chemistry; Autotrophic Processes; Ethinyl Estradiol/chemistry/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior  to this treatment period, the same women received a single administration of a  coated tablet containing 0.1 mg GEST together with 0.03 mg EE2. There was a  wash-out phase of one week between both treatments. Following single dose  administration, a mean terminal half-life of 18 h was observed for GEST. The  total clearance was 0.9 ml x min-1 x kg-1 and the volume of distribution was 84  l. During a treatment cycle, GEST levels in the serum accumulated by a factor of  8 as compared to single dose administration. Steady-state drug levels were  reached during the second half of each cycle. As compared to single dose  administration, the following changes were observed for GEST at the end of  treatment cycles one and three: prolonged terminal half-life (20 to 22 h),  reduced total (0.16 ml x min-1 x kg-1) and free clearance (ca. 27 ml x min-1 x  kg-1), reduced volume of distribution (ca. 18 l). A concomitant EE2-induced  increase in the SHBG concentrations by a factor of three as compared to  pretreatment values was observed during a treatment cycle and appeared to be  mainly responsible for the changes in the pharmacokinetics of GEST. Marked  changes were also seen for the serum protein binding of GEST. After single dose  administration, the free fraction of GEST was 1.3% and the fractions bound to  SHBG and albumin were 69.4% and 29.3%, respectively. At the end of cycle one, the  free fraction was only 0.6% and the fractions bound to SHBG and albumin were  81.4% and 18.0%, respectively. There was no difference in corresponding  pharmacokinetic parameters and in the serum protein binding of GEST at the end of  cycles one and three. On the last day of treatment cycles one and three, the  AUC(0-4h) values of EE2 were 299.2 and 278.1 pg x ml-1 x h, respectively, which  corresponds to an about 30% increase as compared to single dose administration,  where an AUC(0-4h) value of 216.1 pg x ml-1 x h was found. Total and free  testosterone concentrations decreased during treatment cycles one and three by  about 36% and 60%, respectively, compared with the corresponding values measured  prior to treatment.

Although isotretinoin and estradiol are  metabolized largely by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and glucuronidation, the  potential for clinical drug interaction, with subsequent pharmacodynamic impact,  has not been evaluated. METHODS: We enrolled 26 healthy women who were to receive  isotretinoin for the treatment of severe, recalcitrant nodular acne and who were  taking or planning to take oral contraceptives. The pharmacokinetics of ethinyl  estradiol and norethindrone (INN, norethisterone) (the components of Ortho Novum  7/7/7; Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc, Raritan, NJ) and pharmacodynamic  assessments of oral contraceptive effectiveness (concentrations of serum  progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone) were  determined on days 6 and 20 of 2 separate oral contraceptive cycles, before and  during isotretinoin treatment. RESULTS: The addition of isotretinoin to the oral  contraceptive regimen resulted in small and inconsistent, although statistically  significant (P <.04), decreases in the concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol  (9% decrease in area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24  hours after the dose on day 6) and norethindrone (11% decrease in maximum plasma  concentration on day 20). Isotretinoin did not cause any statistically  significant increases in pharmacodynamic markers, although a majority of women  had increases in these measures. Although there was no correlation between  isotretinoin (or metabolite) levels and oral contraceptive levels (P >.05), there  was a correlation between progesterone level and oral contraceptive levels (P  <.05). Variability was large for both pharmacokinetic measures (median  coefficients of variation of 44%-69% [for each time point within a study period])  and pharmacodynamic measures (median coefficients of variation of 64%-114%). One  woman in each study phase, one before and one during isotretinoin treatment, had  a progesterone elevation consistent with possible ovulation. No serious or  unexpected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The small reduction in  ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone levels associated with isotretinoin was not  associated with any pharmacodynamic changes in our study. The combination of the  teratogenic risk of isotretinoin and the large variability of and correlation  between oral contraceptive levels and pharmacodynamic measures, however, strongly  reinforces the necessity of additional contraceptive methods during concomitant  administration of these drugs.","2004-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:47","","464-475","","5","75","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15116059","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Progesterone/blood; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Luteinizing Hormone/blood; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Acne Vulgaris/drug therapy/pathology; Isotretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Keratolytic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intrauterine device is highly effective but its use is limited because  of the technical skill required for successful insertion. The mechanism of action  of both the Yuzpe regimen of EC and of levonorgestrel is poorly understood and  for all methods there are serious methodological difficulties involved with  calculating efficacy. Nevertheless the risks and side-effects of EC are  negligible and the practicalities of prescribing it are extremely simple.

Because of a  potential risk of fetal toxicity based on animal studies, women of childbearing  potential are advised to take effective contraceptive measures during and for 2  months after stopping fingolimod therapy. To assess whether the efficacy of a  combined oral contraceptive (OC) could be compromised during fingolimod therapy,  a steady-state, drug-drug interaction study of fingolimod with  ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel was performed in healthy female volunteers.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the interaction between fingolimod 0.5 mg once daily and  ethinylestradiol 30 μg/ levonorgestrel 150 μg once daily at a steady state.  METHODS: 31 healthy women received the combined OC only on Days 1 - 14, followed  by OC plus fingolimod on Days 15 - 28. RESULTS: In the presence of fingolimod,  ethinylestradiol pharmacokinetics were unchanged, and levonorgestrel maximum  plasma concentration at steady state and area under the concentration-time curve  during a dosing interval increased by factors of 1.10 (90% CI 1.05 - 1.16) and  1.22 (90% CI 1.18 - 1.27), respectively.

METHODS: This was an  open-label trial in healthy female volunteers. Eligible women entered cycle 1 of  the trial on the first day of menstruation. Cycle 1 was a medication-free, run-in  phase of approximately 28 days to confirm that normal ovulation occurred.  Volunteers with confirmed ovulation entered the subsequent cycle and started  taking OCs. After establishing ovulation suppression (defined as progesterone  serum concentration <5.1 nm on day 21 of the menstrual cycle) in volunteers  taking the OCs in cycle 2, lacosamide 400 mg/day was administered concomitantly  in the subsequent cycle (cycle 3). The pharmacokinetic parameters of area under  the concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum steady-state plasma drug  concentration (Cmax ), and time to maximum concentration (tmax ) were measured  for the OC components and lacosamide. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 37 volunteers  completed cycle 1, and 32 completed cycle 2. In each of the 31 volunteers who  completed the trial (through cycle 3), pharmacodynamic assessment showed  progesterone serum concentration was <5.1 nm on day 21 of cycle 2, when the OC  was administered alone, and on day 21 of cycle 3, when lacosamide was  administered concomitantly. The AUC of ethinylestradiol alone versus together  with lacosamide was 1,067 ± 404 versus 1,173 ± 330 pg h/ml. Corresponding values  of Cmax were 116.9 ± 48.8 versus 135.7 ± 28.6 pg/ml. For levonorgestrel, the AUC  alone was 74.2 ± 21.4 versus 80.9 ± 18.5 ng h/ml with lacosamide. Corresponding  values of Cmax were 6.7 ± 1.9 versus 7.4 ± 1.5 ng/ml. The AUC and Cmax point  estimates and almost all 90% confidence intervals (except for Cmax of  ethinylestradiol) for ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel (with and without  lacosamide) were within the conventional bioequivalence range, and no relevant  changes in tmax were observed for ethinylestradiol (1.5 ± 0.6 h alone vs.  1.4 ± 0.7 h with lacosamide) or for levonorgestrel (1.5 ± 1.0 h alone vs.  1.1 ± 0.6 h with lacosamide). Lacosamide pharmacokinetics were consistent with  those observed in previous studies of lacosamide alone, with values for AUC of  113.5 ± 20.7 μg h/ml, Cmax of 13.8 ± 2.2 μg/ml, and tmax of 1.1 ± 0.4 h.  SIGNIFICANCE: Lacosamide and an OC containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel  have low potential for drug-drug interaction; therefore, coadministration of the  two drugs is unlikely to result in contraceptive failure or loss of seizure  control.","2013-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:45","","530-536","","3","54","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2013 International League Against Epilepsy.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23360419","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Young Adult; Progesterone/blood; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug Interactions/physiology; Lacosamide; Acetamides/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Anticonvulsants/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study investigated the  effect of EGCG on liver cholesterol metabolism in healthy and  ethinylestradiol-treated rats. EGCG treatment reduced plasma total cholesterol in  ethinylestradiol-treated animals and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol in  both groups receiving EGCG. In healthy rats, despite the decrease in bile flow,  EGCG markedly enhanced biliary secretion of cholesterol and phospholipids. These  changes were correlated with increased expression of ATP-binding cassette  transporter G5 and G8 and scavenger receptor class B type 1, and decreased  expression of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. Ethinylestradiol treatment  caused marked hepatic cholesterol accumulation with a concomitant liver weight  increase and plasma cholesterol reduction. In ethinylestradiol-treated rats, EGCG  co-administration attenuated the increase in liver cholesterol and liver weight.  Furthermore, EGCG blunted induction of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and  raised reduced levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter G5 and G8 and  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase in ethinylestradiol-treated rats. In  conclusion, this study has demonstrated for the first time the ability of EGCG to  enhance biliary cholesterol secretion and to attenuate ethinylestradiol-induced  liver cholesterol accumulation. Changes in the expression of relevant enzymes and  transporters suggest evidence of another mechanism that may contribute to the  overall effect of EGCG on cholesterol metabolism and imply new physiological  consequences of this widely used compound.","2012-09-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","38-45","","1-3","691","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the research was to develop and  evaluate a matrix-type transdermal drug delivery (TDD) system of a combination of  ethinylestradiol (EE) and MPA for interception. STUDY DESIGN: The transdermal  patch of EE and MPA was prepared using various film-forming polymers with and  without n-dibutyl phthalate as plasticizer and with glycerol and sodium lauryl  sulphate as penetration enhancer. All formulations were assayed using UV  spectrophotometer by Vierordt's equation for EE and MPA. RESULTS: The percentage  cumulative release of F6 (optimized formulation) named as 'AGARPRU' was found to  be 99.94%±1.25% and 69.99%±1.02% (mean±SD) through rat skin and 92.69%±2.22% and  53.51%±2.11% (mean±SD) through cadaver skin for EE and MPA, respectively.  Pharmacodynamic studies of 'AGARPRU' in female Wistar rats showed 100%  anti-implantation activity. The in vivo results showed prolonged T(max) of 36 h  for both EE and MPA after transdermal administration compared to oral route (2  h). Moreover, the area under the curve of EE and MPA revealed an increase in  bioavailability after transdermal administration as compared to oral route.  CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that TDD formulation aimed for postcoital  antifertility activity has been successfully developed in female Wistar rats.","2011-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:19:22","","533-538","","5","84","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Major metabolites of EE in humans are the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates,  EE-3-O-glucuronide (EE-G) and EE-3-O-sulfate (EE-S). In the present study,  transport of EE-G and EE-S by the human multidrug resistance proteins MRP1, MRP2,  and MRP3 was investigated using inside-out membrane vesicles, isolated from Sf9  cells expressing human MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3. Vesicular uptake studies showed that  EE-G was not a substrate for MRP1, whereas an ATP-dependent and saturable  transport of [(3)H]EE-G was observed in MRP2 (K(m) of 35.1 +/- 3.5 microM) and  MRP3 (K(m) of 9.2 +/- 2.3 microM) containing vesicles. EE-S was not transported  by either MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3. However, low concentrations of EE-S stimulated  MRP2-mediated uptake of ethacrynic acid glutathione. EE-S also stimulated MRP2  and MRP3-mediated uptake of 17beta-estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide. Interestingly,  EE-S stimulated strongly MRP2- and MRP3-mediated uptake of EE-G by increasing its  apparent transport affinity, whereas no reciprocal stimulation of EE-S uptake by  EE-G was observed. These data indicate that EE-S allosterically stimulates MRP2-  and MRP3-mediated transport of EE-G and is not cotransported with EE-G. Our  studies demonstrate specific active transport of a pharmacologically relevant  drug conjugate by human MRP2 and MRP3, involving complex interactions with other  organic anions. We also suggest that caution needs to be taken when using only  competition studies as screening tools to identify substrates or inhibitors of  MRP-mediated transport.","2004-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","156-164","","1","309","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14722317","","","","Animals; Tritium; Drug Interactions; Cell Line; Biological Transport; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism; Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics; Insecta/cytology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subsequently, dose proportionality for desogestrel and ethinyl E2 kinetics  were demonstrated. DESIGN: Open-label, noncomparative study. SETTING: Healthy  volunteers in an academic research environment. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty white women  who were 19 to 32 years old were solicited via an advertisement. Nineteen of the  20 women completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Study medication consisted of three  cycles of a triphasic oral contraceptive containing desogestrel and ethinyl E2.  Blood samples were taken at baseline and during cycle 3 between -48 and 24 hours  on days 1, 7, 14, and 21, with additional sampling times on day 21 at 48, 60, and  72 hours.

RESULTS: Evaluation of the trough serum levels indicated that a  steady state of 3-keto-desogestrel had been reached. Statistical analysis on the  Cmax, area under the curve (AUC), and Css,min indicated dose proportionality for  the administered desogestrel. Ethinyl E2 serum levels obtained at the same time  points also reflected steady state levels and showed minimal variability. The  statistical analysis on Cmax, AUC, Css,min, and Tmax indicated that the  pharmacokinetics of ethinyl E2 on days 7, 14, and 21 were not statistically  significantly different, indicating dose equivalency.

The apparent initial volume of distribution (AIVD) of total radioactivity after  i.v. administration was of the order of body volume in all species under study;  the AIVD of intact moxestrol was even higher. This is in agreement with  moxestrol's low binding to specific and non-specific plasma proteins. The  half-life of total radioactivity elimination was 14-18 h in the rat and rhesus  monkey, but longer (43 and 78 h, i.v. and oral respectively) in the baboon. In  the dog, the elimination phase could not be distinguished from the distribution  phase and had a half-life of 2 h. The half-life of unchanged moxestrol  elimination was shorter and very similar in the rhesus, baboon and human (6.6,  7.5 and 8.2 h respectively) and only 1.4 h in the dog. Regardless of the route of  administration or the species under study, the clearance and elimination rate of  unchanged moxestrol were higher than of total radioactivity implying that  metabolites and/or conjugation products were eliminated more slowly than intact  product from plasma. Orally administered moxestrol was rapidly absorbed in all  species. Since clearance of total radioactivity and of moxestrol was faster after  i.v. than oral administration, but the radioactivity levels excreted in the urine  were identical for the two routes, a significant first-pass-effect probably  occurred in the liver. Radioactivity distribution in tissues was examined in the  rat. Total radioactivity was higher 24 h after administration of labelled  moxestrol than of labelled ethynyl estradiol in endocrine tissues; it was  equivalent or less in the other tissues. For all tissues, the elimination rate of  moxestrol was greater than, or equal to, that of ethynyl estradiol. In dog urine,  the only product identified was moxestrol; in rhesus or baboon monkey urine, the  principal metabolites were catechol estrogens, which were also present in  appreciable amount in rat bile (as methyl ethers) but were minor metabolites in  human urine. Hydroxylation in position 16 occurred in rats and humans only, in  position 15 alpha in humans and, to a much lesser extent, in rats and monkeys.  Thus, the metabolic profile of moxestrol in rats most closely resembles that in  humans.","1983-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:06","","1223-1234","","2","19","","J Steroid Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 6887930","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Half-Life; Biological Availability; Dogs; Tissue Distribution; Macaca mulatta; Feces/analysis; Papio; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Ten women who had undergone surgical sterilization were  enrolled in an open-label crossover study conducted in the Georgetown University  Clinical Research Center. The pharmacokinetics of single doses of 0.07 mg ethinyl  estradiol and 2 mg norethindrone were measured at baseline and after 3 weeks of  200 mg thalidomide. Compliance with the thalidomide regimen was assessed with use  of Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps. RESULTS: No changes were  observed in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone with  thalidomide therapy. The mean +/- SD area under the plasma concentration-time  curve (AUC0-infinity) for ethinyl estradiol was 6580 +/- 1100 ng.h/L at baseline  and 5970 +/- 1560 ng.h/L after the thalidomide regimen (paired t test, P > .05).  The values for norethindrone were 103 +/- 54 micrograms.h/L and 107 +/- 58  micrograms.h/L (paired t test, P > .05). No changes were observed for other  pharmacokinetic parameters assessed for either ethinyl estradiol or  norethindrone. No accumulation of thalidomide was seen after 21 days of therapy:  day 1 AUC0-infinity 41.1 +/- 13.9 micrograms.h/mL; day 21 AUC0-infinity 59.6 +/-  27.3 micrograms.h/mL (paired t test, P > .05). No changes were observed for other  pharmacokinetic parameters assessed for thalidomide between days 1 and 21.  Thalidomide was well tolerated but caused variable degrees of sedation. The  average thalidomide compliance rate was 97%. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of  thalidomide do not change with 3 weeks of daily dosing. Thalidomide does not  alter the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone. Therefore there  is no drug interaction between thalidomide and these 2 drugs. The efficacy of  oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone should not be  affected by concomitant thalidomide therapy.","1998-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:40:42","","597-602","","6","64","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9871424","","","","*Clinical Research; *District Of Columbia; *Drug Interactions; *Drugs; *Ethinyl Estradiol; *Norethindrone; *Oral Contraceptives; *Research Report; Adult; Americas; Area Under Curve; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; Contraceptive Methods; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Cross-Over Studies; Developed Countries; Estradiol Congeners/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Family Planning; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology; Middle Aged; Norethindrone/blood/*pharmacokinetics; North America; Northern America; Progesterone Congeners/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Research Methodology; Thalidomide/*pharmacology; Treatment; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we investigated effects of single and  combined exposures of silver (Ag) nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the synthetic hormone  17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on tissue uptake of both contaminants in juvenile  turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). Silver uptake and tissue distribution (gills,  liver, kidney, stomach, muscle and bile) were analyzed following a 14-day, 2-h  daily pulsed exposure to AgNPs (2 μg L(-1) and 200 μg L(-1)), Ag(+)  (50 μg L(-1)), EE2 (50 ng L(-1)) and AgNP + EE2 (2 or 200 μg L(-1)+50 ng L(-1)).  Effects of the exposures on plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) levels, EE2 and steroid  hormone concentrations were investigated. The AgNP and AgNP + EE2 exposures  resulted in similar Ag concentrations in the tissues, indicating that combined  exposure did not influence Ag uptake in tissues. The highest Ag concentrations  were found in gills. For the Ag(+) exposed fish, the highest Ag concentrations  were measured in the liver. Our results show dissolution processes of AgNPs in  seawater, indicating that the tissue concentrations of Ag may partly originate  from ionic release. Plasma EE2 concentrations and Vtg induction were similar in  fish exposed to the single contaminants and the mixed contaminants, indicating  that the presence of AgNPs did not significantly alter EE2 uptake. Similarly,  concentrations of most steroid hormones were not significantly altered due to  exposures to the combined contaminants versus the single compound exposures.  However, high concentrations of AgNPs in combination with EE2 caused a drop of  estrone (E1) (female fish) and androstenedione (AN) (male and female fish) levels  in plasma below quantification limits. Our results indicate that the interactive  effects between AgNPs and EE2 are limited, with only high concentrations of AgNPs  triggering synergistic effects on plasma steroid hormone concentrations in  juvenile turbots.","2017-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","328-336","","Pt A","220","","Environ Pollut","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This ring requires no  refrigeration, simplifying the supply chain. Developed by the Population Council,  this CVR will soon be marketed in the United States as Annovera™ by  TherapeuticsMD. Areas Covered: The composition of the elastomer ring and the  chemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of both hormonal  components are discussed. Results of the clinical trials of its efficacy,  tolerability, safety, and acceptability follow. Finally, subanalyses from the  clinical trials are presented to guide clinicians in counseling potential users.  Expert Opinion: This CVR introduces a new progestin - segesterone acetate (SA) -  that has no androgenic or estrogenic action in vitro or in vivo, but has the  highest anti-ovulatory potential of all available progestins. SA is paired with  EE in an intravaginal elastomer ring, that is used cyclically (21 days in place/7  days removed) to provide 12 months (13 cycles) of contraception. This  once-a-month, self-applied CVR offers a convenient, rapidly reversible, year-long  contraception with efficacy and side effect profiles similar to other combined  hormonal methods, for women with BMI < 29 kg/m(2).","2019-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","953-963","","10","12","","Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31526281","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Drug Combinations; United States; Drug Approval; United States Food and Drug Administration; *Contraceptive Devices, Female; contraceptive vaginal ring; *Long-Acting Reversible Contraception; Annovera; birth control; combined hormonal contraception; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/adverse effects; nestorone; Pregnenediones/*administration & dosage/adverse effects; segesterone; Silicone Elastomers/chemistry; vaginal ring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each sulfate was administered orally and intravenously to  five ovariectomized volunteer women. Blood samples were taken over a period of 24  h. Radioimmunoassay for free and sulfoconjugated ethynyl estradiol (EE) was  performed. The analysis of the plasma concentrations obtained after  administration of EE-3 and EE-17 indicates significant differences in their  pharmacokinetic profiles. EE-3 is cleared more rapidly from the central  compartment (systemic circulation), which may indicate that differences in  protein binding, tissue binding, metabolism, and distribution exist between EE-3  and EE-17. It has been suggested that these conjugates are a slow-release  reservoir for maintenance of blood levels of free EE itself. However, previous  studies in baboons have shown that the half-lives of the free and sulfoconjugated  EE are similar (ranging from 8.8 to 11.2 h), which is not consistent with this  hypothesis. The t1/2 beta (mean 9.28 h) of the 17-sulfate after IV administration  was almost identical in women and baboons, and similar to the t1/2 beta of free  EE, confirming the previous observation. Only 3.4% of IV and 11.4% of the orally  administered 17-sulfate appeared in the blood as free EE; with the 3-sulfate, the  conversions were 13.7 and 20.7%, respectively, suggesting that these sulfates are  not important slow-release reservoirs. The similarity of pharmacokinetic  parameters between women and baboons suggests that this species of nonhuman  primate is, in important respects, a suitable animal model for clinical  pharmacology.","1988-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:07","","63-79","","1-2","51","","Steroids","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3242167","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Intravenous; Research Methodology; United States; Population; Texas; *Time Factors; Developed Countries; Clinical Research; Contraception; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Demographic Factors; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--administraction and dosage; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Female--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--administraction and dosage; Americas; North America; Northern America; *Human Volunteers; *Animals, Laboratory; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; Ovariectomy; Population Dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the 1st cycle the maximal gestodene levels increased from 2.1 to 6.2 ng/ml  on Day 1 to values between 7.5 and 22.0 ng/ml on Day 21. During the 3rd and 6th  treatment cycle the levels were still higher with maxima between 10.1 and 26.3  ng/ml, while during the 12th cycle the gestodene concentrations were slightly  lower. The serum levels of SHBG rose significantly during intake of the pill up  to values between 210 and 240 nmol/l on Day 21 of each cycle, and were reduced to  a certain degree during the pill-free interval. The SHBG concentrations  correlated closely with the area under the gestodene concentration-versus-time  curves (AUC) indicating a pronounced influence of serum protein binding upon the  pharmacokinetics of gestodene. The gestodene levels of the individual women  remained relatively constant during the 12 treatment cycles, although great  interindividual differences were found. It is concluded that the relatively high  serum concentrations of gestodene are not only based on the binding to SHBG, but  probably also on an impeded metabolism of gestodene.","1988-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:33:26","","477-486","","4","38","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3208516","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Biology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Physiology; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/*analysis; Family Planning; Contraceptive Agents--side effects; *Contraception; *Ethinyl Estradiol--administraction and dosage; *Reproductive Control Agents; Contraceptive Agents--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents--analysis; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--administraction and dosage; Endocrine System; *Contraceptive Agents, Female; *Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--analysis; *Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--side effects; *Examinations And Diagnoses; *Hormones--administraction and dosage; *Hormones--side effects; Norpregnenes/*blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two formulations  contained 30 micrograms EE2 each, together with either 75 micrograms G or 150  micrograms D. Of the 40 young women recruited for each formulation, 31 of each  group were available for statistical evaluation. The pharmacokinetics of serum  EE2 were studied on day 1, 10 and 21 of cycle 1, 3 and 6. There were no  significant differences between the two groups in any cycle with respect to  parameters measured. This was true for the distinct intracyclical rise in the  mean EE2 serum levels from day 1 to day 10 and the smaller further increase  between day 10 and day 21, with no change in this respect between the cycles  studied. Respective changes were seen with regard to the area under the EE2 serum  concentration curve up to 4 and 24 hours (AUC0-4 and AUC0-24), cmax and tmax of  serum EE2. The estrogen-dependent corticoid-binding globulin (CBG) increased  similarly in the two groups intracyclically and slightly also intercyclically at  all times tested. Except for the first treatment cycle, urinary excretion of  cortisol and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol displayed a tendency to lower values  intracyclically as well as intercyclically, again with no differences between the  two groups. Also, the 6 beta-hydroxycortisol-to-cortisol ratio was not different  between the groups, showing a slight tendency to rise from about 4 at the  beginning of the medication to around 5.5 at the end of the 6th treatment cycle  in both groups. It is concluded that G and D as components of low-dose OCs exert  comparable effects on the metabolism and elimination of EE2.","1993-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:31","","263-281","","3","47","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8462317","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Hormones; Biology; Drug Interactions; Oral Contraceptives; Physiology; Research Methodology; Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Radioimmunoassay; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; *Clinical Research; *Oral Contraceptives, Low-dose; *Research Report; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; *Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Desogestrel; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; *Comparative Studies; *Oral Contraceptives, Combined; Endocrine System; Hematological Effects; Hemic System; *Human Volunteers; *Enzymatic Effects; *Gestodene; *Transcortin Bound Cortisol Alterations; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Desogestrel/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Enzymes And Enzyme Inhibitors; Hydrocortisone/analogs & derivatives/*urine; Norpregnenes/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Transcortin/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN:  This open-label, three-period, five-treatment, crossover study randomized 24  healthy women to one of six external condition sequences. Each sequence included  one normal wear and two external conditions periods. Participants wore the AP for  7 days under normal conditions or conditions of daily sauna, treadmill, whirlpool  or cool water immersion, with a 7-day washout between treatments. Blood samples  were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluations. RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects  completed the study. For EE, the mean maximum concentration level (Cmax), area  under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 168 h (AUC(0-168)) and  area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity  (AUC(0-inf)) were higher during normal conditions compared with all external  conditions (geometric means ratio range: 80%-93%), except cool water.

Goldfish  were exposed to EE2 via two different routes: water (135ng/L±12.8 standard  deviation) for 72h, and food (231ng/g±42 SD) for 120h. We observed a rapid uptake  of EE2 in goldfish, reaching 8.4ng/g±1.2 dry weight (dw) after the first hour of  exposure with an uptake rate coefficient (k1) of 45h(-1). The elimination rate  coefficient (k2) was determined by a depuration experiment to be 0.0786h(-1). In  the feeding experiment, EE2 concentrations increased rapidly, reaching an average  of 1.4ng/g after 3h following the first dietary exposure with an estimated  absorption efficiency (α) of 0.106. An average of 2.66ng/g±0.87 (n=8) was  determined in the 24-72h samples, whereas EE2 concentrations in fish fell below  our method detection limits (0.67ng/g) for all samples after 72h, suggesting  efficient elimination over time. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) for EE2  reached a maximum of 377, similar to BCFs measured for other pharmaceuticals like  fluoxetine and sertraline. Our kinetic data were also used to model various  scenarios of EE2 uptake in the aquatic environment.

OBJECTIVES: To assess: ticagrelor effects on ethinyl  oestradiol/levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics, endogenous sex hormone levels;  ethinyl oestradiol/levonorgestrel effects on ticagrelor pharmacokinetics;  tolerability of ticagrelor + ethinyl oestradiol/levonorgestrel. METHODS: This  trial was a randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover, single-center study.  Twenty-two healthy female volunteers (on stable ethinyl  oestradiol/levonorgestrel) received 90 mg ticagrelor or placebo twice daily with  ethinyl oestradiol/levonorgestrel (0.03 mg/0.15 mg; Nordette) on cycle days 1-21.  Volunteers crossed over treatment on day 1/cycle 2. Pharmacokinetic parameters  were evaluated on cycle day 21, and endogenous hormones assayed on cycle days 1,  7, 14 and 21. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT006895906. RESULTS: Ethinyl  oestradiol absorption was rapid (median t(max) approximately 1 hour), and was not  affected by ticagrelor. Ticagrelor co-administration (90% confidence interval  [CI]) increased AUC(0-τ), C(min), and C(max) of ethinyl oestradiol by 20%  (1.03-1.40), 20% (0.96-1.50) and 31% (1.18-1.44), respectively. Ticagrelor had no  effect on levonorgestrel pharmacokinetic parameters versus placebo (90% CI:  AUC(0-τ) 0.97-1.10; C(min) 0.94-1.10; C(max) 1.02-1.16). Steady-state ticagrelor,  and AR-C124910XX (major and equally pharmacologically active metabolite),  AUC(0-τ), C(max), and t(max) were comparable with published findings. Pre-dose  ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX plasma concentrations were higher on cycle day 21  versus days 7 and 14. Endogenous sex hormone plasma levels were unaffected by  ticagrelor. Co-administration of ticagrelor with ethinyl  oestradiol/levonorgestrel was well tolerated. Study limitations included: no  ticagrelor-only arm; only one type of oral contraceptive; short study duration;  using oestradiol/levonorgestrel pharmacokinetic parameters as surrogate marker  for contraceptive efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Ticagrelor co-administration with  ethinyl oestradiol/levonorgestrel increased ethinyl oestradiol exposure by  approximately 20%, with no effect on levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics. No  clinically relevant effect on contraceptive efficacy is expected with ethinyl  oestradiol/levonorgestrel and ticagrelor co-administration.","2011-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:18","","1585-1593","","8","27","","Curr Med Res Opin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21692601","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Drug Interactions; Ticagrelor; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Estrogens/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Adenosine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drospirenone is a novel progestogen with antimineralocorticoid,  progestogenic and antiandrogenic activity. The theoretical (0-0.07) and corrected  (0.41-0.71) Pearl indices and pregnancy ratios (0.3-0.84) in young, healthy women  aged 18-35 years (or 18-30 years if smokers) given 13-26 cycles of EE/DRSP in  large multi-center trials indicate that this CC is highly effective in preventing  pregnancy. EE/DRSP is equally as effective as ethinylestradiol  30microg/desogestrel 150microg (EE/DSG; corrected Pearl index 0.28-0.41) in  preventing pregnancy. EE/DRSP is generally well tolerated. The frequency and type  of adverse event reported in clinical trials are typical of those observed with  other CCs, and comparable to those in women receiving EE/DSG. The incidence of  intermenstrual bleeding (spotting, breakthrough bleeding or both) during  treatment with EE/DRSP in young, healthy women decreased rapidly after the first  cycle to 9 to 18% in the second cycle and 6% after 26 cycles, indicating good  cycle control. The incidence of intermenstrual bleeding was similar in recipients  of EE/DSG (9 and 14% in cycle 2 and 10% in cycle 26). Bodyweight was maintained  +/- 2kg in most young women who received EE/DRSP for up to 26 cycles. Neither  EE/DRSP nor EE/DSG showed clinically significant effects on blood pressure.  EE/DRSP improved premenstrual and menstrual symptoms (negative affect, water  retention, increased appetite) compared with baseline in a noncomparative trial.  A similar improvement in skin condition (acne, seborrhea) was observed in women  receiving EE/DRSP or ethinylestradiol 35microg/cyproterone acetate 2mg in a  randomized, double-blind trial. CONCLUSIONS: Data from several 1- to 2-year  studies show that EE/DRSP is an effective oral contraceptive, with Pearl index  values similar to those of established low-dose CCs. This combination is well  tolerated, demonstrating good cycle control and a beneficial effect on skin  condition and well-being (including some premenstrual and menstrual symptoms).  EE/DRSP has demonstrated similar efficacy and tolerability to EE/DSG, but  long-term clinical experience is required to establish the position of EE/DRSP  among other available CCs and to clarify any potential tolerability advantages.  Nevertheless, because the management of tolerability is complicated by the  idiosyncratic nature of the response of women to CCs containing different  progestogens, EE/DRSP appears to be a useful treatment option for women desiring  oral contraception.","2003","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","49-70","","1","2","","Treat Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 15871554","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Kidney Diseases; Lactation; Tissue Distribution; Absorption; MEDLINE; Contraception; *Androstenes/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; *Contraceptives, Oral; *Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Progesterone Congeners","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two rabbit groups were utilized, the first  group received amoxicillin (10 mg/kg) and EE2 (30, 50 and 100 micrograms/kg,  respectively), both by intravenous (i.v.) route. The second group received  amoxicillin (oral route, 10 mg/kg/day) and EE2 (i.v. route, 100 mu/kg) on day 1,  4 and 8 of antibiotic treatment, respectively. After compartmental  (two-compartment open model) and non-compartmental analysis of plasma  concentrations, the statistical study (ANOVA p < or = 0.05) revealed that the  presence of amoxicillin did not modify the EE2 distribution and elimination  pharmacokinetic parameters (by comparison with those obtained in a previous study  where EE2 was administered alone).

METHODS: Twenty-two healthy women aged  18-44 years were recruited, and 16 of them completed the study. By using a  randomized double-blind crossover design, each woman was studied in two different  menstrual cycles, during which placebo or OCBZ (maintenance dosage, 1,200 mg/day)  was given in randomized sequence for 26 consecutive days with a washout of at  least one cycle in between. A steroid oral contraceptive containing 50 microg  ethinylestradiol (EE) and 250 microg levonorgestrel (LN) was taken for the first  21 days of each cycle. Plasma concentrations of EE and LN were measured by gas  chromatography-mass spectrometry in samples collected at regular intervals on  days 21-23 of each cycle. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, areas under the plasma  concentration curves (AUC(0-24h, geometric means) decreased by 47% for both EE  (from 1,677 to 886 pg.h/ml; p < 0.01) and LN (from 137 to 73 ng.h/ml; p < 0.01),  during OCBZ treatment. Peak plasma EE concentrations decreased from 180 pg/ml  during the placebo cycle to 117 pg/ml during the OCBZ cycle (p < 0.01), whereas  peak plasma LN concentrations decreased from 10.2 to 7.7 ng/ml (p < 0.01). The  half-lives of EE and LN also decreased from 13.6 to 7.9 h (p < 0.01) and from  28.8 to 15.8 h, respectively (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: OCBZ reduces plasma  concentrations of the estrogen and progestagen components of steroid oral  contraceptives, presumably by stimulating their CYP3A-mediated metabolism in the  liver or gastrointestinal tract or both. Because this may lead to a decreased  efficacy of the contraceptive pill, women treated with OCBZ should receive  preferentially a high-dosage contraceptive and should be monitored for signs of  reduced hormonal cover.","1999-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:28:31","","783-787","","6","40","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10368079","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Half-Life; Cross-Over Studies; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Placebos; *Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/drug effects/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Carbamazepine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Levonorgestrel/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Oxcarbazepine; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: A Phase 1, open-label, single-center  study in 36 healthy women was conducted over three cycles with a randomized  crossover design. After a run-in cycle of 21 days on and 7 days off with  AG200-15, participants were randomized to receive one of two treatments: a  21/7-day cycle of AG200-15 either followed or preceded by one cycle of the COC.  This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT01243580.  RESULTS: During the third week of AG200-15 use, mean (±standard deviation)  maximum serum concentration (C(max)), area under the curve(0-168 h) and  steady-state concentration (C(ss48-168 h)) for EE were 51.3 ± 17.3 pg/mL, 6.26 ±  2.46 ng h/mL and 35.7 ± 14.5 pg/mL, respectively; for LNG, the corresponding  values were 2400 ± 1140 pg/mL, 317 ± 159 ng h/mL and 1847 ± 930 pg/mL,  respectively. The AG200-15 EE C(max) was approximately 60% lower and the EE C(ss)  was 15%-20% lower than those obtained with the COC. The calculated daily dose of  AG200-15 was equivalent to a 30-mcg EE COC. The most common adverse events (AEs;  >10%) in the AG200-15 group were headache, nausea and application-site  irritation. All drug-related AEs were mild, and no serious AEs were reported.

BACKGROUND: Females of childbearing  age experience the highest prevalence of migraine and frequently inquire about  the concomitant use of anti-migraine medications and contraceptives. Rimegepant,  a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, demonstrated efficacy and  safety for treating an acute migraine attack and preventing migraine. METHODS:  This open-label, single-center, phase 1, drug-drug interaction study explored the  effects of rimegepant 75 mg daily dose on the pharmacokinetics of an oral  contraceptive containing EE/NGM 0.035 mg/0.25 mg in healthy females of  childbearing potential or non-menopausal females with tubal ligation. During  cycles 1 and 2, participants received EE/NGM once daily for 21 days followed by  placebo tablets with inactive ingredients for 7 days. Rimegepant was administered  during only cycle 2 for 8 days, from days 12 through 19. The primary endpoint was  the effect of single and multiple doses of rimegepant on the pharmacokinetics of  EE and norelgestromin (NGMN), an active metabolite of NGM, at steady state,  including area under the concentration-time curve for 1 dosing interval  (AUC(0-τ,ss) ) and maximum observed concentration (C(ss[max]) ). RESULTS: The  study enrolled 25 participants, with pharmacokinetic data assessed for 20  participants. A single 75 mg dose of rimegepant co-administered with EE/NGM  increased exposures of EE and NGMN by ≤16% (geometric mean ratio [GMR], 1.03; 90%  confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.06; and GMR, 1.16; 90% CI, 1.13-1.20,  respectively).

In this study 10  women received a triphasic formulation that contained ethinyl estradiol together  with the progestin gestodene over one treatment cycle. Mean area under the curve  values of ethinyl estradiol were significantly higher on the last treatment day,  as compared with the corresponding values obtained from the same women after  single-dose administration. However, the observed increase in area under the  curve was within the range of pharmacokinetic accumulation, to be expected on the  basis of dosing interval and terminal half-life. Another point of interest was  the effect of the triphasic preparation on testosterone concentrations in serum.  Both total and free testosterone levels were suppressed by about 60% as compared  with pretreatment values, and there was no correlation with corresponding sex  hormone-binding globulin levels in the serum.","1991-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:33:51","","596-602","","3","165","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1892184","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Hormones; Biology; Half-Life; Europe; Physiology; Research Methodology; Germany; Testosterone/*blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/analysis; Developed Countries; Contraception; Family Planning; Androgens; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Methods--administraction and dosage; Endocrine System; Western Europe; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; *Gestodene; Transcortin/analysis; Oral Contraceptives--administraction and dosage; *Clinical Research--women; *Methodological Studies; *Oral Contraceptives, Phasic--administraction and dosage; *Testosterone--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptives, Oral, Sequential/*administration & dosage; Norpregnenes/administration & dosage; Oral Contraceptives, Combined--administraction and dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effect  of zonisamide on the pharmacokinetics of the individual components of a  combination OC (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 0.035 mg and norethindrone [NOR] 1 mg) and  on pharmacodynamic variables that may be increased in the event of reduced  contraceptive efficacy (concentrations of serum luteinizing hormone [LH],  follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], and progesterone). METHODS: This was a  single-center, open-label, 1-sequence, crossover study. Healthy, premenopausal  women received the combination OC for three 28-day cycles (combination OC for 21  days, followed by placebo for 7 days). Following stabilization on the OC during  the first cycle, blood was collected during cycle 2 for the determination of  serum EE and NOR profiles (day 14) and serum LH, FSH, and progesterone  concentrations (days 13-15). Starting on day 15 of cycle 2, zonisamide was  administered orally at 100 mg/d and titrated to a target dose of 400 mg/d. EE and  NOR profiles and serum LH, FSH, and progesterone concentrations were obtained  again in cycle 3 (in the presence of zonisamide) and compared with those from  cycle 2 (in the absence of zonisamide). RESULTS: Thirty-seven healthy  premenopausal women (mean age, 26.1 years [range, 18-51 years]; mean body weight,  65.5 kg [range, 50.4-93.1 kg]; mean height, 165.8 cm [range, 152.4-182.9 cm])  received > or =1 dose of zonisamide. Of the 33 subjects (89.2%) who completed the  study, 26 (78.8%) underwent titration to a stable zonisamide dose of 400 mg/d.  For EE, the mean (SD) AUC over a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC(tau)) was 1139  (317) pg.h/mL in cycle 2 and 1143 (312) pg.h/mL in cycle 3; the mean C(max) in  the respective cycles was 133 (39) and 141 (46) pg/mL. For NOR, the corresponding  values were 140 (48) and 159 (46) ng.h/mL for AUC(tau) and 21 (5.4) and 23 (6.7)  ng/mL for C(max). The 90% Cls for the geometric mean ratios (cycle 3:cycle 2) for  AUC(tau) and C(max) fell within the accepted range for lack of interaction  (0.80-1.25). There were no increases in LH, FSH, or progesterone concentrations  between cycle 2 and cycle 3. CONCLUSIONS: In these healthy volunteers,  steady-state zonisamide dosing had no clinically significant effect on the  pharmacokinetics of EE or NOR. There was no pharmacodynamic evidence that  zonisamide is likely to reduce the contraceptive effectiveness of OCs containing  EE and NOR.","2004-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:13","","2056-2065","","12","26","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15823769","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Intestinal Absorption; Cross-Over Studies; Zonisamide; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Isoxazoles/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacology; Norethindrone/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Premenopause/drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pharmacokinetic  properties of desogestrel were characterized by the following parameters: (1)  maximum serum concentration, (2) time to maximum serum concentration, (3) total  area under the serum concentration versus time curve, and (4) serum half-life of  elimination. The interindividual variation in these parameters was comparable  with that observed with other contraceptive combinations containing ethinyl  estradiol and norethisterone, levonorgestrel, or gestodene. The serum  distribution of contraceptive progestogens is known to be determined by their  affinity to sex hormone-binding globulin and the concentration of sex  hormone-binding globulin. We analyzed the structural features that determine  binding to sex hormone-binding globulin. The 18-methyl group increased and the  11-methylene group weakened the binding to sex hormone-binding globulin. The  double bond at C-15 reinforced the binding only when combined with an 18-methyl  group. Therefore, the binding of levonorgestrel (the 18-methyl derivative of  norethisterone) and gestodene (the delta-15,18 methyl derivative of  norethisterone) to sex hormone-binding globulin was much stronger than that of  3-keto-desogestrel and norethisterone.","1990-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:25:17","","2132-2137","","6 Pt 2","163","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2147817","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Administration, Oral; Half-Life; Research Methodology; Studies; Population; Radioimmunoassay; *Time Factors; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Contraceptive Methods; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Levonorgestrel; Demographic Factors; *Clinical Research; *Ethinyl Estradiol; *Levonorgestrel; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--pharmacodynamics; Desogestrel; *Comparative Studies; *Desogestrel--pharmacodynamics; Norpregnenes/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; *Norethindrone; *Oral Contraceptives; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Population Dynamics; *Gestodene; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Norgestrel/blood/pharmacokinetics; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Sixteen healthy women were treated with a low-dose OC (Loestrin 1/20)  and a placebo for two consecutive 28-day cycles in a single-blind sequential  trial. Treatment with St John's Wort 300 mg three times daily was then added for  two additional 28-day cycles. Outcomes compared between control and treatment  cycles included the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol,  daily bleeding diaries, follicle growth, changes in cervical mucus and  progesterone levels drawn at 7- to 10-day intervals. RESULTS: Treatment with St.  John's Wort was associated with a significant 13-15% reduction in the dose  exposure from the contraceptive. Breakthrough bleeding increased in the treatment  cycles, as did evidence of follicle growth and probable ovulation. CONCLUSION:  St. John's Wort is associated with increased metabolism of norethindrone and  ethinyl estradiol, breakthrough bleeding, follicle growth and ovulation. Women  using OCs should be cautioned that St. John's Wort might interfere with  contraceptive effectiveness.","2005-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:13","","402-408","","6","71","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15914127","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; *Herb-Drug Interactions; Ovulation/*drug effects; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Estrogens/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Hypericum/*metabolism; Metrorrhagia; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This randomized, open-label, five-group  study included two 28-day cycles. Five groups of female subjects received oral  doses of ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35 alone (cycle 1) and then concomitant with TPM or CBZ  (cycle 2). The treatment groups were group 1, TPM, 50 mg/day; group 2, TPM, 100  mg/day; group 3, TPM, 200 mg/day; group 4, TPM, 200 mg/day (obese women); and  group 5, CBZ, 600 mg/day. Group 4 comprised obese women whose body mass index  (BMI) was between 30 and 35 kg/m(2). The BMI of the remaining four groups was <  or =27 kg/m2. RESULTS: Coadministration of TPM at daily doses of 50, 100, and 200  mg (nonobese) and 200 mg (obese) nonsignificantly (p > 0.05) changed the mean  area under the curve (AUC) of ethinyl estradiol by -12%, +5%, -11%, and -9%,  respectively, compared with OC monotherapy. A similar nonsignificant difference  was observed with the plasma levels and AUC values of norethindrone (p > 0.05).  CBZ (600 mg/day) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the AUC values of  norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by 58% and 42%, respectively, and increased  their respective oral clearance by 69% and 127% (p < 0.05). Because CBZ induces  CYP 3A-mediated and glucuronide conjugation metabolic pathways, the significant  increase in the oral clearance of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone was  anticipated. CONCLUSIONS: TPM, at daily doses of 50-200 mg, does not interact  with an OC containing norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol. The lack of the TPM-OC  interaction is notable when it is compared with the CBZ-OC interaction.","2003-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:27:44","","540-549","","4","44","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12681003","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Combinations; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; Body Mass Index; Obesity/*blood; Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology; Carbamazepine/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; Mestranol/*pharmacokinetics; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/blood; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood; Fructose/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology; Topiramate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Are drug interactions of clinical significance?","Drug safety","","0114-5916","10.2165/00002018-199309010-00003","","There is a large quantity of literature on drug interactions with oral contraceptive (OC) steroids although their incidence is not known. The potential  clinical significance of some interactions makes it important for all prescribing  doctors and dentists to have some knowledge of the topic. Interactions may be  divided into those in which OC effectiveness is impaired, causing breakthrough  bleeding or pregnancy, those in which OC activity is enhanced by other drugs and  those in which OCs interfere with the metabolism or activity of other therapeutic  agents. Consideration of their pharmacology indicates that impairment of OC  effect is most likely to be due to interference with ethinylestradiol. This is  because this compound is sulphated in the gut wall, hydroxylated and  glucuronidated in the liver, and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The  progestogens are only metabolised in the liver and have no significant  enterohepatic recirculation. Protein binding interactions are rarely of clinical  importance. OC plasma concentrations may be reduced by induction of hepatic  metabolism in the case of griseofulvin, rifampicin (rifampin) and several  anticonvulsant drugs; valproic acid (sodium valproate) does not have this effect.  Antibiotics may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation of ethinylestradiol  and reduce plasma levels of active hormone. This is probably only of significance  in a subgroup of women who may sometimes be suspected on history, but cannot be  identified by any diagnostic test. Reasons for differences between case reports  and formal studies of interactions with antibiotics are discussed. Plasma  concentrations of ethinylestradiol may be increased by ascorbic acid (vitamin C)  and paracetamol (acetaminophen) which compete with it for sulphation in the gut  wall. Theoretically, problems may arise if these agents are stopped suddenly.  Imidazole antifungal agents can inhibit ethinylestradiol metabolism and increase  its plasma concentrations but the clinical significance of this is unknown. OCs  have been shown to inhibit metabolism of many therapeutic drugs and increase  their plasma concentrations. This may be of clinical significance in the case of  benzodiazepines which are hydroxylated in the liver, but clinical effects are  less certain with the other agents. OCs may induce metabolism of other drugs  which are glucuronidated, including some benzodiazepines and analgesics. The  clinical significance of this type of interaction is also unknown. It is  suggested that all prescribers should remember to ask about OCs when taking a  drug history and to consider the possibility of interactions with other drugs.","1993-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","21-37","","1","9","","Drug Saf","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8347289","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Anticonvulsants/pharmacology; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Progestins/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We therefore investigated the serum  concentrations of estradiol, ethinylestradiol and norethisterone in 25 patients  of a gynecological practice who were continuously treated for climacteric  complaints with a combination of 2 mg estradiol, 1 mg estriol and 1 mg  norethisterone acetate for a time period between 4 months and 6 years. Blood  sampling occurred between 1 and 20 h after intake of the last tablet. The mean  serum concentration of estradiol was 138 +/- 50 (53-279) pg/ml, of  ethinylestradiol 18.1 +/- 13.5 (0-44) pg/ml, and of norethisterone 5.1 +/- 3.5  (0.7-11.6) ng/ml. The serum concentrations of estradiol showed a broad maximum  between 1 and 14 h, and those of norethisterone a steep rise to maximum within  1-4 h after intake followed by a subsequent decline. Contrary to this, the  ethinylestradiol levels were not related to the time after application indicating  that the aromatization of norethisterone mainly occurs in peripheral tissue.  There was no correlation between age, body mass index or duration of treatment  and the ethinylestradiol levels. It is concluded that in the presence of the high  estradiol concentrations the low conversion rate of norethisterone into  ethinylestradiol is probably without clinical significance.","1995-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","245-250","","3","21","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 7616874","","","","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Postmenopause/*metabolism; *Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Norethindrone Acetate; Ethinyl Estradiol/*blood; Estradiol/*administration & dosage/blood; Estriol/*administration & dosage; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of polymer types, polymer ratios, permeation  enhancers, drug loadings and drug ratios in different layers on the skin  permeations of the drugs were evaluated using excised mice skin. Polariscope  examination was carried out to observe the drug distribution behavior. The  formulation with the mixture of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone  (PVP) (7:1) was found to provide the regular release and propylene glycol (PG)  could enhance the permeation fluxes of drugs. Double-layer transdermal drug  delivery system (TDDS) could sustain the steady permeation flux of drugs for 7  days when the ratio of drug in drug release layer and drug reservoir layer was  1:4 with the identical total drug amount. The in vitro transdermal permeation  fluxes were 0.377 microg/cm(2)/h and 0.092 microg/cm(2)/h, for GEST and EE  respectively. The uniformity of dosage units test showed that the distribution of  drugs in the matrix was homogeneous, which was further demonstrated by the  polariscope result. The developed transdermal delivery system containing GEST and  EE could be a promising non-oral contraceptive method.","2009-07-30","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","128-134","","1-2","377","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19463930","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Time Factors; Mice; Permeability; Drug Delivery Systems/*methods; Administration, Cutaneous; Skin Absorption; Polymers/chemistry; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Delayed-Action Preparations/adverse effects/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Norpregnenes/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  relatively little is known about the kinetics of induction and elimination of VTG  in fish exposed to xenoestrogens. In this study, we administered graded  intra-arterial doses (0.001, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) of 17alpha-ethynylestradiol  (EE(2)) to male rainbow trout via a dorsal aortic cannula which allowed  repetitive blood sampling from individual fish for up to 48 days after injection.  The plasma concentrations of VTG was quantified using an enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay procedure and the simultaneous concentrations of EE(2) were  determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The pattern of VTG induction  was similar for all doses of EE(2), with a 12-h lag-time before increase from  basal levels (0.006-0.008 microg/ml), then increasing sharply to maximum levels  within 7-9 days (C(max)=0.05, 711, 1521 and 2547 microg/ml VTG for the 0.001,  0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg doses, respectively). After induction by EE(2), VTG  declined mono-exponentially with an elimination half-life of 42-49 h. The  half-life of VTG increased to 145 h in the 10 mg/kg treated fish. The  pharmacokinetics of EE(2) were distinctly nonlinear with substantial increases in  the elimination half-life with increasing dose. The plasma concentration-time  profiles of EE(2) were influenced by enterohepatic recirculation that caused  multiple or secondary peaks in the profiles. In a separate experiment, the  pharmacokinetics of purified VTG was characterized after intra-arterial injection  in trout. After direct injection of VTG, plasma levels declined tri-exponentially  with an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 837 ml/kg; total body  clearance was 31.1 ml/h per kg, and the elimination half-life was 43.7 h.","2001-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:19","","305-318","","3","51","","Aquat Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 11090892","","","","Male; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Immunohistochemistry; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Glucuronidase/metabolism; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacology; Oncorhynchus mykiss/*metabolism; Vitellogenins/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The predominant  mechanism of action for transdermal ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin (Ortho Evra,  Evra) is inhibition of ovulation by suppression of gonadotropins. It suppresses  follicular development, induces changes to the endometrium that reduce the  probability of implantation, and increases the viscosity of cervical mucus, which  may prevent sperm penetration into the uterus. Two large randomized, nonblind  efficacy studies demonstrated that transdermal ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin  was as efficacious in preventing pregnancy as oral triphasic  ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel or oral ethinylestradiol/desogestrel. A large,  noncomparative study also showed transdermal ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin to  have good contraceptive efficacy. Moreover, in the two comparative trials, women  using transdermal ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin had higher rates of perfect  compliance than women using oral contraception. Age did not affect the rate of  perfect compliance in women using the transdermal ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin  patch, whereas the rate of compliance reduced with younger age in oral  contraceptive users. Pooled results from three efficacy studies found that 1.8%  of patches were replaced as a result of complete detachment and 2.9% because of  partial detachment. Physical exercise, water immersion, and living in a humid  climate did not affect patch adhesion. Transdermal  ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials.  The most common menstrual disturbances were breakthrough bleeding/spotting and  dysmenorrhea. The incidence of discontinuation of treatment because of an adverse  event was < or = 3.2%, with the most common reason being application-site  reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin offers a well  tolerated, effective, reversible, and easy-to-use method of hormonal  contraception with an increased likelihood of compliance relative to oral  contraceptives.","2003","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","191-206","","3","2","","Treat Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 15966567","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Combinations; Administration, Cutaneous; Oximes; Ethisterone/analogs & derivatives; Norgestrel/analogs & derivatives; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptive Agents, Female/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  constituents of the preparations are as follows: Ovral (50 micrograms  ethinyloestradiol, EE2 and 500 micrograms levonorgestrel, LNG); Nordette (30  micrograms EE2 and 150 micrograms LNG); and Norminest (35 micrograms EE2 and 500  micrograms norethisterone, NOR). Peak plasma concentrations of EE2 ranged between  116-160 pg ml-1 for Ovral, 55-78 pg ml-1 for Norminest and 30-70 pg ml-1 for  Nordette. There was no significant difference in half-life (t1/2), oral clearance  (CL) or apparent volume of distribution (Vd). The relative values of the area  under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) reflected well the different  amounts of oestrogen in each preparation. There was no significant difference in  t1/2, CL or Vd for LNG in the 2 preparations containing this progestogen. The  mean AUC following Nordette (150 micrograms LNG) was 40% of that following Ovral  (500 micrograms LNG; p less than 0.001). Comparing pharmacokinetic parameters for  the same dose of LNG (Ovral) and NOR (Norminest) showed the AUC to be decreased  and CL and Vd increased in the latter group.

Differences between the AUC-EE of pairs from the same manufacturer (1 + 35 and 1  + 50) were not significantly different, indicating that 50 micrograms of  mestranol was equivalent to 35 micrograms ethinyl estradiol with respect to this  pharmacokinetic parameter. The Cmax values were also similar. Inter-individual  coefficients of variation (C.V.) for the AUC-EE were 47% and 57% for the 1 + 35  and 1 + 50 agents, respectively. Intra-individual C.V.s were 41% and 42%,  respectively. For norethindrone, the AUC was larger with the 1 + 50 formulations  than with the 1 + 35 group (87.9 vs. 72.8 pg hr/ml). Additionally, the Cmax  values were larger for the 1/50 group (17.7 vs. 14.0).

Maximum levels of EE  and ENG with NuvaRing were 30% and 40%, respectively, of those seen with the COC.  Because ENG bioavailability was higher following vaginal administration, the  systemic progestogen exposures were comparable with the two contraceptives.  However, the EE bioavailabilities were similar with both routes and so EE  exposure with NuvaRing was half that with the COC. Pharmacodynamic studies have  examined ovarian function during recommended and altered NuvaRing use. The use of  NuvaRing for the recommended 3-week period completely inhibited ovulation. During  an additional 2 weeks of use, ovulation continued to be inhibited. Early NuvaRing  removal after just 3 days had no effect on the time to ovulation compared with  recommended use, thus indicating that 3 days of use seem to be sufficient to  suppress ovarian activity. Finally, delayed ring insertion (when the follicles  had developed to 13 mm) resulted in inhibition of ovulation in all women. In  conclusion, NuvaRing effectively inhibits ovulation during recommended and  altered use, showing that it is a robust contraceptive method.","2002-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:33:02","","13-8; discussion 37-39","","","7 Suppl 2","","Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12659397","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Biological Availability; Patient Compliance; Contraception; Ethinylestradiol; *Desogestrel; *Contraceptive Devices, Female; Etonogestrel; Contraceptive Agents, Female/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Ovulation Inhibition/*drug effects; Vinyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; NuvaRing; Ovulation; Vaginal ring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its oral bioavailability is about 33% after  administration of 30 or 100 micrograms to healthy volunteers and slightly lower  than that of ethynyl estradiol (50%) due to a ""first-pass effect"". Moxestrol is  rapidly metabolized by the liver as shown by the much increased bioavailability  (60.5%) in patients with impaired liver function. The radioimmunoassay for  moxestrol measures plasma moxestrol levels ranging from 100 pg/ml (maximum) to 10  pg/ml (24 h value) after treatment with a 100 micrograms commercial formulation  (Surestryl). Moxestrol metabolism was studied on urine which contained 28% of  administered radioactivity after i.v. or oral administration. Hydroxylation was  the main transformation pathway as for ethynyl estradiol. Moxestrol yielded  metabolites hydroxylated (or methoxylated) at C-2, C-15 and C-16, but not at C-6,  and also gave rise to D-homo derivatives. The main difference between moxestrol  and ethynyl estradiol lies in the relative importance of these pathways. The  presence of the ethynyl group of ethynyl estradiol impedes attack at C-16 and  hydroxylation at C-2 to form catechol estrogens becomes a major pathway, whereas  the 11 beta-methoxy group of moxestrol impedes hydroxylation at C-2 and ring D  hydroxylated products of moxestrol are formed. The low amount of catechol  estrogens obtained with moxestrol compared to ethynyl estradiol could have  important physiological implications in the human.","1983-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","565-573","","5","18","","J Steroid Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 6855232","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The ring  has the same working mechanism and contraindications as COCs. Serum levels of  steroids are steadier, whereas oestrogenic exposure is lower.

Oestrogen-related adverse  symptoms appear to be fewer, but reports on the incidence of venous thrombosis  are conflicting. Expulsion of the ring is reported by 4% to 20% of women. Local  adverse events are the main reason for discontinuation. Acceptability is as high  as with COCs and, after structured counselling, the ring is preferred by many  women to the pill or the patch.

Doxorubicin is mainly excreted into the bile via  P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) in  hepatobiliary route and metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily. Also  the hepatic Mrp2 (not P-gp) and CYP3A subfamily levels were reduced in EE-induced  cholestatic (EEC) rats. Thus, we herein report the pharmacokinetic changes of  doxorubicin with respect to the changes in its biliary excretion and hepatic  metabolism in EEC rats. 2. The pharmacokinetic study of doxorubicin after  intravenous administration of its hydrochloride was conducted along with the  investigation of bile flow rate and hepatobiliary excretion of doxorubicin in  control and EEC rats. 3. The significantly greater AUC (58.7% increase) of  doxorubicin in EEC rats was due to the slower CL (32.9% decrease). The slower CL  was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and  hepatic CYP3A subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of doxorubicin.  These results might have broader implications to understand the altered  pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacologic effects of doxorubicin via biliary  excretion and hepatic metabolism in experimental and clinical estrogen-induced  cholestasis.","2013-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:58","","901-907","","10","43","","Xenobiotica","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23574017","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Administration, Intravenous; Bile/*metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism; Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Liver/drug effects/*metabolism; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics; Cholestasis/*chemically induced/metabolism; Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of  steady-state ethinyl estradiol (INN, ethinylestradiol) and single-dose triazolam  were altered after 4 weeks of modafinil treatment in volunteers. METHODS: This  was a placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-period study in 41 female subjects  who were receiving long-term treatment with an oral contraceptive that contained  ethinyl estradiol (0.035 mg) and norgestimate (0.180-0.250 mg). Pharmacokinetic  profiles for ethinyl estradiol and for a single oral dose of triazolam (0.125 mg)  were obtained the day before initiation of treatment with modafinil (200 mg for 7  days, followed by 400 mg for 21 days) or placebo (28 days). A second dose of  triazolam was administered with the final dose of modafinil, and pharmacokinetic  profiling was repeated. RESULTS: The modafinil treatment group had a marked  decrease in maximum observed plasma concentrations and areas under the plasma  concentration-time curve for triazolam relative to placebo, with a much smaller  decrease in these parameters for ethinyl estradiol. The half-life of triazolam  was also decreased, but the half-life of ethinyl estradiol did not appear to be  affected by treatment with modafinil. CONCLUSION: Modafinil induced CYP3A4/5  activity in humans in vivo, suggesting that there is potential for metabolic  drug-drug interactions between modafinil and substrates of CYP3A4/5. However, the  induction appeared to be more gastrointestinal than hepatic in nature. Therefore  significant metabolic drug-drug interactions are most likely to occur with  compounds (such as triazolam) that undergo significant gastrointestinal  CYP3A4/5-mediated first-pass metabolism.","2002-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:56","","46-56","","1","71","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11823757","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Biomarkers; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Mass Spectrometry; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Single-Blind Method; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Modafinil; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Benzhydryl Compounds/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Central Nervous System Stimulants/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Estradiol Congeners/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Hypnotics and Sedatives/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Triazolam/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This exploratory, open-label,  nonrandomized study was conducted to investigate the systemic exposure to  ethinylestradiol after intramuscular administration of norethisterone enantate in  comparison with the exposure to ethinylestradiol after administration of a  standard combined oral contraceptive. Sixteen healthy premenopausal women  received an oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol 30 μg/levonorgestrel 150 μg)  once daily for 21 days and-after a 1-week washout period-a single intramuscular  dose of 200 mg norethisterone enantate. Blood samples to determine  ethinylestradiol in serum were taken over 24 hours after the last dose of  ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel and over 8 weeks after administration of  norethisterone enantate. Oral equivalent doses of ethinylestradiol were estimated  based on area under the concentration-time curves. The ethinylestradiol serum  concentrations observed after administration of norethisterone enantate were  relatively low: The mean maximum concentration was only 32% of the maximum  observed after ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (90% confidence interval,  22.5%-44.7%). The maximum oral equivalent dose of ethinylestradiol was markedly  lower than 30 μg ethinylestradiol per day (20.3 μg/day; 90% confidence interval,  14.8-28.0 μg/day). The same applied to the average oral equivalent dose of  ethinylestradiol for the 8-week postdose interval (4.41 μg/day; 90% confidence  interval, 3.57-5.46 μg/day). To conclude, the study results indicate that  metabolic conversion of norethisterone to ethinylestradiol also occurs after  intramuscular administration of 200 mg norethisterone enantate, but is associated  with a lower exposure to ethinylestradiol than the use of a combined oral  contraceptive containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol (plus 150 μg levonorgestrel).","2018-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:29:30","","781-789","","6","58","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29522253","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Injections, Intramuscular; thromboembolism; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; ethinylestradiol; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; contraception; hormone replacement therapy; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Norethindrone/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; norethisterone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, with extended regimens, unscheduled intracycle bleeding can become  problematic. Flexible extended dosing of a contraceptive containing drospirenone  (DRSP) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) was designed to improve bleeding profiles  during extended cycles through active management of bleeding symptoms. AREAS  COVERED: We examine the rationale for flexible extended dosing as well as review  the dosing regimen. We will focus on the findings of the two most important  clinical trials regarding flexible extended DRSP/EE (3 mg/20 μg), including the  bleeding profiles of women in those trials. Pharmacology, mechanisms of action,  efficacy as well as safety of DRSP containing pills will also be reviewed. EXPERT  OPINION: Flexible extended dosing of DRSP/EE (3 mg/20 μg) has similar  pharmacokinetics and contraceptive efficacy of both conventional and fixed  extended regimens. However, it has the added benefit of fewer days of  bleeding/spotting compared to conventional and fixed extended regimens.","2014-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","2071-2079","","14","15","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25186109","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Administration Schedule; Menstruation; drospirenone; combined oral contraceptive; *Androstenes/administration & dosage/adverse effects; *Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/adverse effects; *Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/adverse effects; cycle regulation; ethinyl estradiol; flexible extended regimen; Flexyess; menstrual bleeding; oral contraceptive pills","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alterations  in the rate of 2-hydroxylation can have major effects on the pharmacokinetics and  effectiveness of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol as a contraceptive. The major human  catalyst of the 2-hydroxylation reaction is liver microsomal cytochrome P-450  IIIA4. Lesser amounts of this enzyme are found in other tissues such as the  intestine and may contribute to overall clearance of the orally administered  contraceptive. In individuals with very low amounts of this enzyme other forms of  cytochrome P-450 may make some contribution. Levels of cytochrome P-450 IIIA4  vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of 17  alpha-ethynylestradiol 2-hydroxylation. The known inducibility of the enzyme by  barbiturates and rifampicin explains their effects in enhancing 17  alpha-ethynylestradiol clearance and reducing the effectiveness of the drug.  Mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P-450 IIIA4 can be seen with 17  alpha-ethynylestradiol and other 17 alpha-acetylenic steroids, and the  progestogen gestodene appears to be unusually active in this regard. Other  unknown factors may also modulate levels of cytochrome P-450 IIIA4 and its  ability to catalyze 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol 2-hydroxylation.","1990","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:21","","1981-1988","","22","47","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 2273938","","","","Humans; Enzyme Induction; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Drug Interactions; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Hydroxylation; Sulfates/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AOBs biotransformed EE2 but not TMP, whereas heterotrophs  mineralized EE2, biotransformed TMP, and mineralized EE2-derived metabolites  generated by AOBs. Kinetic bioassays showed that AOBs biotransformed EE2 five  times faster than heterotrophs. The basal expression of heterotrophic dioxygenase  enzymes was sufficient to achieve the high degree of transformation observed at  EE2 and TMP concentrations ≤ 1 mg/L, and enhanced enzyme expression was not  necessary. The importance of AOBs in removing EE2 and TMP was evaluated further  by performing NAS experiments at lower feed concentrations (500-1000 ng/L). EE2  removal slowed markedly after AOBs were inhibited, while TMP removal was not  affected by AOB inhibition. Two key EE2 metabolites formed by AOB and  heterotrophic laboratory-scale chemostats were also found in independent  laboratory-scale mixed culture bioreactors; one of these, sulfo-EE2, was largely  resistant to further biodegradation. AOBs and heterotrophs may cooperatively  enhance the reliability of treatment systems where efficient removal of EE2 is  desired.","2011-04-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","3605-3612","","8","45","","Environ Sci Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21428279","","","","Oxidation-Reduction; Biotransformation; Ammonia/*metabolism; Water Microbiology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism; Bacteria/*metabolism; Heterotrophic Processes; Trimethoprim/*metabolism; Waste Disposal, Fluid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  overview summarizes the relevant pharmacokinetic data for the contraceptive  patch. DESIGN: Review article. RESULT(S): The amount of norelgestromin and EE  absorbed from the patch is proportional to patch size: the 20-cm(2) patch (Ortho  Evra) delivers norelgestromin, 150 microg/d, and EE, 20 microg/d, to the systemic  circulation. After single and multiple applications of the contraceptive patch,  daily serum concentrations (area under the serum concentration-versus-time curve)  of norelgestromin and EE were within the ranges generally seen with oral  norgestimate, 250 microg/EE 35 microg (Ortho-Cyclen/Cilest), but without the  peaks and troughs characteristic of oral dosing. Moreover, the contraceptive  patch maintains serum concentrations of norelgestromin and EE within these ranges  for up to 10 days, suggesting that clinical efficacy would be maintained even if  a scheduled change is missed for as long as two full days. Regardless of the  location of patch application (abdomen, buttock, upper outer arm, or torso  [excluding breasts]) and even under conditions of heat, humidity, exercise, and  cool-water immersion, efficacious concentrations of norelgestromin and EE are  achieved. Coadministration of the patch with tetracycline did not affect the  pharmacokinetics of norelgestromin and EE. CONCLUSION(S): The contraceptive patch  exhibits an excellent pharmacokinetic profile, maintaining efficacious serum  hormone concentrations under varying conditions.","2002-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:35:45","","S3-12","","2 Suppl 2","77","","Fertil Steril","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11849630","","","","Humans; Female; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Biological Availability; Drug Combinations; Administration, Cutaneous; Drug Delivery Systems; Oximes; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Ethisterone/analogs & derivatives; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three open-label phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy human  participants to investigate potential pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic  (PD) interactions between albiglutide and medications that may be used  concomitantly. METHODS: Digoxin 0.5 mg, warfarin 25 mg, or a standard, low-dose  oral contraceptive containing norethindrone (NE) 0.5 mg and ethinyl estradiol  (EE) 0.035 mg were administered alone and after steady-state albiglutide exposure  (50 mg weekly for 4-5 weeks). The lack of a drug-drug interaction was concluded  if the 90% CIs of geometric least-squares means ratio of area under the curve and  maximum concentration were fully contained within 0.80 to 1.25. The effects of  albiglutide on the PD of warfarin (international normalized ratio) and on the PD  of a low-dose oral contraceptive (luteinizing hormone [LH], follicle-stimulating  hormone [FSH], and progesterone) were assessed. Safety and tolerability were also  assessed. RESULTS: Overall, the PK profiles of digoxin, warfarin, NE, and EE were  unaffected by albiglutide administration; standard bioequivalence criteria were  met with a few exceptions that were not considered clinically relevant. Warfarin  international normalized ratio was unaffected by albiglutide administration. No  clinically meaningful differences in LH, FSH, or progesterone were observed. Most  treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, and all resolved by study end.  CONCLUSION: Based on tolerability and the lack of clinically significant PK or PD  interactions, no dose adjustments should be required when albiglutide is  administered concomitantly with these medications.","2012-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:16","","55-72","","6","124","","Postgrad Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23322139","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Young Adult; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Digoxin/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Norethindrone/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Warfarin/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CBZ and IOP did not sorb to the four biomass types. EE2 did not sorb to  the pure culture but sorbed significantly to the heterotrophic cultures and NAS.  TMP sorbed to the heterotrophic cultures and NAS, and was not evaluated for the  pure culture. Three floc characteristics (hydrophobicity, median particle size,  organic matter content) correlated moderately well with the EE2 organic matter  sorption coefficient (KOM,EE2). Zeta potential did not correlate well with  KOM,EE2 but did with KOM,TMP, indicating that TMP sorption is more influenced by  electrostatic factors than EE2. Once divalent cation-linked exocellular polymeric  substances (EPS) were removed from flocs, EE2 and TMP sorption to the non-EPS  (cellular) fraction decreased by approximately 50%. The correlation between  KOM,EE2 for the non-EPS cellular fraction deteriorated while the correlation  between KOM,TMP improved.

Comparison of the results of the intravenous and oral  administration of the steroid suggested that its oral bioavailability is 42%.  Although EE thus has a lower bioavailability than norethindrone, the  pharmacokinetics of the two steroids, as reflected by half-lives, plasma  clearance and volume of distribution, are very similar. The occurrence of a  secondary peak in plasma at around 12 hours after dosing gave strong evidence  that EE undergoes enterohepatic circulation in women; an event that may have  considerable clinical significance.","1979-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:24:40","","263-273","","3","20","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 509953","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rabbits; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Injections, Intravenous; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Research Methodology; Radioimmunoassay; Contraception; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; *Clinical Research; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; *Ethinyl Estradiol--administraction and dosage; *Ethinyl Estradiol--analysis; *Laboratory Procedures; Contraceptive Agents--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Female--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--administraction and dosage; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*metabolism; *Norethindrone; Norethindrone/blood; Norgestrel/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This phase I study consisted of 3  periods with an uncontrolled first period and a double-blind, placebo-controlled,  cross-over design in the second and third period. All subjects received a single  dose of 200 mg losigamone (1 tablet) in period 1 (on day 14) as well as multiple  doses of losigamone (3 tablets = 600 mg per day) or placebo for 15 days in  periods 2 and 3. During all three periods an oral contraceptive containing 30  microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg levonorgestrel was given. Single-dose  pharmacokinetics was investigated on day 14 of period 1. Multiple-dose  pharmacokinetic investigations were performed on day 15 of periods 2 and 3. The  samples were assayed to derive pharmacokinetic data of ethinylestradiol and  levonorgestrel. In addition, the concentrations of losigamone racemate (AO-33)  and its enantiomers AO-242 and AO-294 were determined in these samples. RESULTS:  The mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and Cmax of  ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel after multiple-dose treatment with losigamone  or placebo were quite similar and met the criteria for bioequivalence. The 90%  confidence intervals of the log-transformed ratios of the geometric means of the  primary pharmacokinetic variables were included in the respective acceptance  ranges of 80% to 125% (AUC) and 70% to 143% (Cmax). CONCLUSIONS: The study  demonstrated that multiple doses of losigamone did not influence the multiple  dose kinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. The single- and  multiple-dose kinetics of 200 mg losigamone and its enantiomeres did not differ  from each other in a significant way. The combination of losigamone and the  combined oral contraceptive was well tolerated and no serious adverse events  occurred. It can be stated that the antiepileptic drug losigamone and the  combined contraceptive do not interact each others metabolism.","2004","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:27:35","","152-159","","3","54","","Arzneimittelforschung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 15112861","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Stereoisomerism; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/pharmacokinetics; Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Furans/adverse effects/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article will  summarize finding from clinical studies Phase I, II and III of EE/LNG TCDS.  EXPERT OPINION: The development of the lower dose EE/LNG TCDS has demonstrated  less EE exposure. The serum levels of EE and LNG were stable and comparable  between various application sites and daily life conditions. Moreover, the EE/LNG  TCDS showed comparable efficacy among obese and non-obese users.

Water and sediment  residue analysis was performed by LC/MS-MS, while biota extracts were analyzed  using both LC/MS-MS and a recombinant yeast estrogen receptor assay. At the  lowest exposure concentration, C. tentans accumulated less EE2 than H. azteca in  the water-only assays (p=0.0004), but due to different slopes, this difference  subsided with increasing concentrations; at the exposure concentration of 1mg/L,  C. tentans had a greater body burden than H. azteca (p=0.02). In spiked  sediments, C. tentans had the greatest EE2 accumulation (1.2+/-0.14 vs.  0.5+/-0.05 microg/gdw, n=4). Measurements in H. azteca indicated a negligible  contribution from the sediments to the uptake of EE2 in this species. These  differences were likely due to differences in the behavior and life history of  the two species (epibenthic vs. endobenthic). Water-only bioaccumulation factors  (BAFs) calculated at the lowest exposure concentration were significantly smaller  in C. tentans than in H. azteca (31 vs. 142, respectively; p<0.0001). In  contrast, the sediment bioaccumulation factor (BSAF) of C. tentans was larger  than that of H. azteca (0.8 vs. 0.3; p<0.0001). Extracts of the exposed animals  caused a response in a recombinant yeast estrogen receptor assay, thus confirming  the estrogenic activity of the samples, presumably from EE2 and its estrogenic  metabolites. The results of the present study suggest that consumption of  invertebrate food items could provide an additional source of exposure to  estrogenic substances in vertebrate predators.","2009-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1635-1641","","6","72","","Ecotoxicol Environ Saf","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19477518","","","","Animals; Chromatography, Liquid; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Environmental Monitoring; Amphipoda/*drug effects/metabolism; Chironomidae/*drug effects/metabolism; Estrogens/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Fresh Water/chemistry; Geologic Sediments/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the potential of  these systems for transdermal drug delivery the permeation of ethinylestradiol  from four formulations with different polymers was tested across heat separated  human epidermis. The formulation with the best results was then modified by  incorporating chemical enhancers to further increase the efficiency of the  delivery system. Finally, drug delivery from the developed film forming systems  was compared to a commercially available transdermal patch in vitro as well as in  vivo in pigs. Among the tested preparations the formulation with  polyurethane-14-AMP-acrylates copolymer (DynamX) showed the highest  ethinylestradiol permeation. The drug transport was further increased with the  incorporation of oleic acid as penetration enhancer, especially when used in  combination with propylene glycol. The enhancing effect of oleic acid/propylene  glycol was concentration-dependent and increased disproportionately with rising  enhancer content. The film forming solution showed a higher ethinylestradiol  permeation through heat separated human epidermis than the commercial EVRA patch  in vitro and achieved measurable plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol in  vivo in pigs. These promising results encourage the further development of film  forming polymeric solutions as novel transdermal dosage form.","2007-04-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","196-203","","2","118","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 17289207","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Time Factors; Permeability; Drug Combinations; Swine; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Dosage Forms; Organ Culture Techniques; Administration, Cutaneous; Drug Compounding; Hypromellose Derivatives; *Drug Carriers; Polymers/*chemistry; Polyurethanes/chemistry; *Skin Absorption/drug effects; Diffusion Chambers, Culture; Acrylates/chemistry; Contraceptive Agents/administration & dosage/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/metabolism; Epidermis/drug effects/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Methylcellulose/analogs & derivatives/chemistry; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Oleic Acid/pharmacology; Propylene Glycol/pharmacology; Silicones/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and  ethinyl estradiol plus levomefolate calcium was formulated to decrease the risk  of neural tube defects in pregnancies conceived while taking or shortly after  discontinuing this pill. AREAS COVERED: Because of its novelty, very few studies  have been performed to evaluate the efficacy, side effects and safety related to  contraception, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and acne; therefore, literature  evaluating similar contraceptives without levomefolate is reviewed. Additionally,  we review studies evaluating the addition of levomefolate calcium to oral  contraceptives containing 3 mg drospirenone and either 20 or 30 μg ethinyl  estradiol. To date, no study has been performed to evaluate the effect this new  oral contraceptive has on reducing the incidence of neural tube defects. EXPERT  OPINION: This new pill has similar contraceptive efficacy, side effect, safety  and benefits profile to other drospirenone-containing contraceptives. While also  approved to prevent neural tube defects, no studies validate this claim and  physician time is better spent counseling women, regardless of contraceptive  choice, on the importance of folic acid supplementation during the child-bearing  years.","2011-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","2403-2410","","15","12","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21877996","","","","Humans; Female; Androstenes/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Calcium/*administration & dosage; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Glutamates/*administration & dosage; Neural Tube Defects/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the aim of the  present study was to examine the effect of metformin on BA homeostasis and  related molecular pathways in the liver and intestine using a mouse model of ICP.  The cholestasis was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by repeated administration of  ethinylestradiol (10 mg/kg BW s.c.) and/or metformin (150 mg/kg BW orally) over 5  consecutive days with subsequent bile collection and molecular analysis of  samples. We demonstrated that metformin significantly increased the rate of bile  secretion in control mice. This increase was BA dependent and was produced both  by increased liver BA synthesis via induced cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1)  and by increased BA reabsorption in the ileum via induction of the apical  sodium-dependent BA transporter (Asbt). In contrast, metformin further worsened  ethinylestradiol-induced impairment of bile secretion. This reduction was also BA  dependent and corresponded with significant downregulation of Bsep, and Ntcp,  major excretory and uptake transporters for BA in hepatocytes, respectively. The  plasma concentrations of BA were consequently significantly increased in the  metformin-treated mice. Altogether, our data indicate positive stimulation of  bile secretion by metformin in the intact liver, but this drug also induces  serious impairment of BA biliary secretion, with a marked increase in plasma  concentrations in estrogen-induced cholestasis. Our results imply that metformin  should be used with caution in situations with hormone-dependent cholestasis,  such as ICP.","2021-08-25","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","109525","","","345","","Chem Biol Interact","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

When the biomass was grown without nitrogen  limitation, the biomass mean particle size had a dramatic effect on the observed  partitioning coefficient (K(d)) and on sorption hysteresis index (HI). MBR K(d)  (0.33-0.57L/g) values were equal to or larger than those of the CBR  (0.25-0.33L/g). Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, the correlations between the  biomass particle size and K(d) and HI were poor, likely because of extracellular  polymeric substances. The K(d) and HI were determined for initial EE2  concentrations between 100 and 1000microg/L. Changing the SRT did not manipulate  particle size, and the effects on K(d) and HI were not dramatic.

STUDY DESIGN: We asked participants (n=30) to apply consecutive patches to be  worn continuously (without a patch-free interval) for 12 weeks. We collected  blood samples at the end of each patch week and two times during weeks 4, 8, and  12 (with the additional blood draw occurring mid-week). Liquid  chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was utilized  to assess EE2 and NGMN levels. RESULTS: Twenty-seven women completed the study;  26 were compliant with patch use. Ethinyl estradiol levels ranged from 0 to 193  pg/mL over the period. We observed an accumulation over the 12-week time at an  estimated rate of 2.15 pg/mL per week (95% confidence interval 0.95-3.35,  p<.001). The change in NGMN levels ranged from 0 to 2.52 ng/mL over the 12 weeks  (95% confidence interval 0.021-0.019, p=.915). The most common side effects  reported were vaginal spotting, breast tenderness and abdominal pain/cramping.  There were no serious adverse events reported. CONCLUSION: While the range of  weekly EE2 values was quite wide, the absolute values remain low and generally  within the expected range described in product labeling. Providers may consider  prescribing continuous use of the patch, but given the slow accumulation of EE2  over time, 12 weeks should not be exceeded in the absence of safety data.","2017-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:23","","578-585","","6","95","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The consecutive decrease of ovulation inhibition has been compensated by  the introduction of potent progestagens. Therefore, the contraceptive safety has  been maintained in presence of less side-effects. The effect of ultra-low-dose OC  on acne and seborrhea remains beneficial. The effect of ultra-low-dose OC on bone  is contradictory. Because there are fundamental differences between Estradiol and  EE, the thromboembolic risk is not decreased by the parenteral administration of  EE. In users of the contraceptive patch, it is even increased. EE is not bound at  SHBG. Because of its Ethinyl group, the inactivation of EE occurs slowly.  Therefore, EE reaches the liver in a low but constant concentration where it  modifies many estrogen-dependent hepatic parameters significantly. One of these  is hemostasis. It is generally accepted that such changes are responsible for the  increased thromboembolic risk of the contraceptive patch and vaginal ring. A  reduction of the hormone-free interval of the pill to 5 or 4 days results in a  complete suppression of the ovarian function, a reliable ovulation inhibition and  an increase of the contraceptive efficacy in spite of a reduction of the EE  dosage to 20 microg or 15 microg.","2009-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","93-99","","2","66","","Ther Umsch","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 19180429","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Risk Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Drug Administration Schedule; Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology; Liver/drug effects; Administration, Cutaneous; Administration, Intravaginal; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Ovulation/drug effects; Thromboembolism/blood/chemically induced/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we investigated estrone,  17β-estradiol and 17α-ethynylestradiol removals and transformation products by  four common microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, Selenastrum capricornutum,  Scenedesmus quadricauda, and Chlorella vulgaris. It was found that H. pluvialis,  S. capricornutum and S. quadricauda could more effectively remove all three  estrogens in synthetic wastewater effluent. The estrogenic activities i.e.  17β-estradiol equivalency determined by yeast estrogenic screening assay showed  substantial estrogenic activity reductions after biotransformation by H.  pluvialis, S. capricornutum, and S. quadricauda. Quadrupole Time-of-flight Mass  Spectrometry results identified several possible ring-cleavage metabolites as  well as their metabolic pathways, which had not been reported yet, confirming the  estrogen degradation rather than mere absorption or uptake by microalgae. The  findings demonstrate that not only can some specific bacteria degrade estrogens,  but also the widely living microalgae are able to degrade these emerging  pollutants, suggesting that microalgae could be an advanced treatment of WWTPs to  remove nutrients and estrogens.","2019-09-30","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","723-732","","","180","","Ecotoxicol Environ Saf","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Synthetic oestrogens influence liver structure and function,  leading to adaptations or to dysfunctions/injury. They are often stated to induce  increases in fish liver weight, but there is controversy regarding how: if by  changes in hepatocyte size (hypertrophy) and/or number (hyperplasia). Using  platyfish as the experimental model, our primary aim was to assess if/how  hepatocytes reacted to a sub-acute oestrogenic exposure. A complementary aim was  to generate fundamental structural data for the liver of that model organism.  Adult males were injected intramuscularly with 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2)  (25 μg/g), every 72 h for two weeks. Control fish were given solvent only. Body  and liver morphometry were registered, and hepatocytes examined through histology  and stereology at light microscopy. Immunohistochemistry evaluated hepatocytic  vitellogenin (VTG) content. Treated and control fish did not differ as to  quantitative parameters. Nevertheless, exposed fish were sensitive to EE2. VTG  tagging was positive in their hepatocytes and these tended to be more basophilic,  though not fully oestrogenized. We hypothesise that the platyfish liver is not  particularly sensitive to the disrupting action of EE2 because of its  reproductive mode; with no production peaks of VTG and no huge changes in  endogenous sex-steroids. The fish may have had no evolutionary pressure for  hepatocytes to be particularly reactive to oestradiol (E2). In the end, this  study offers the first unbiased estimation of the liver cellularity in the  platyfish, as well of the hepatocytic volume, serving now as a baseline  reference.","2020-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","101327","","","63","","Tissue Cell","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of  microalgae for secondary wastewater effluent polishing is a promising approach  due to the economic benefit and value-added products. In this study, three  microalgae species, including Selenastrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus quadricauda  and Chlorella vulgaris were selected to conduct batch experiments to examine  important mechanisms, especially the role of algal extracellular organic matter  (AEOM) on two selected estrogens (17β-estradiol, E2 and 17α-ethynylestradiol,  EE2) removal. Results showed that estrogens could not be significantly degraded  under visible light irradiation and adsorption of estrogens by microalgae was  negligible. All three living microalgae cultures have ability to remove E2 and  EE2, and Selenastrum capricornutum showed the highest E2 and EE2 removal  efficiency of 91% and 83%, respectively, corresponding to the reduction of  predicted estrogenic activity of 86%. AEOM from three microalgae cultures could  induce photodegradation of estrogens, and AEOM from Selenastrum capricornutum and  Chlorella vulgaris achieved 100% of E2 and EE2 removal under visible light  irradiation. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy identified  humic/fulvic-like substances in AEOM from three microalgae cultures, which might  be responsible for inducing the indirect photolysis of E2 and EE2. Therefore, in  the living microalgae cultures, the major estrogens removal mechanisms should  include biotransformation as well as AEOM meditated photocatalytic degradation.  Since removal rates through photodegradation could be faster than  biotransformation, the AEOM mediated photocatalytic degradation can play a  potential role to remove emerging contaminants when using microalgae technology  for wastewater effluent treatment.","2021-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","111818","","","209","","Ecotoxicol Environ Saf","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Ethinyl estradiol (mean systemic bioavailability 40% to  50%) is extensively metabolized, principally to a sulfate conjugate. In vivo  studies that use portal vein catheterization and the administration of  radiolabeled ethinyl estradiol have shown that the fraction of steroid  metabolized in the gut wall is 0.44. In vitro studies with jejunal biopsy samples  or larger pieces of jejunum or terminal ileum mounted in Ussing chambers have  indicated that more than 30% of added ethinyl estradiol is sulfated. The  progestogen desogestrel is a prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite  3-ketodesogestrel. Substantial first-pass metabolism of desogestrel occurs in the  gut mucosa, with evidence from Ussing chamber studies for the formation of the  active metabolite. Another progestogen, norgestimate, is also metabolized by the  gut wall in vitro of which the principal metabolite is the deacetylated product,  norgestrel oxime.

METHODS: During a run-in phase, 18 healthy female patients  received an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol, 0.03 mg, and  levonorgestrel, 0.15 mg, for the first 21 days of two consecutive menstrual  cycles. In a subsequent double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover treatment  phase, subjects received either levetiracetam, 500 mg, or placebo twice daily  concomitant with the oral contraceptive. Plasma concentrations of ethinyl  estradiol and levonorgestrel were measured on days 14 and 15 of the two treatment  periods for the evaluation of the 24-h kinetic parameters, and an additional  sample was collected on day 21 to determine the trough plasma concentrations.  Serum progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were determined on days  13, 14, 15, and 21 of each cycle of the treatment phase. RESULTS: The plasma  concentration-time curves and pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol and  levonorgestrel were not statistically different during concomitant treatment with  either levetiracetam or placebo. The ratios of the log-transformed geometric mean  areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs), maximal (Cmax) and  minimal (Cmin) plasma concentrations, and trough concentrations on day 21 (C21)  ranged from 99.12 to 99.96% for ethinyl estradiol and from 97.13 to 99.41% for  levonorgestrel. The 90% confidence intervals of these ratios were well within the  80 to 125% acceptance range for lack of interaction. Serum progesterone and LH  concentrations were fairly constant during the run-in and treatment phases and  remained markedly below their respective physiologic levels. Safety and  menstrual-bleeding patterns were comparable during levetiracetam and placebo  administration. CONCLUSIONS: Levetiracetam does not affect the pharmacokinetics  of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, and on  the basis of serum progesterone and LH levels, it does not affect the  contraceptive efficacy.","2002-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:47","","697-702","","7","43","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12102671","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Levetiracetam; Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/blood/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol-Norgestrel Combination/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Piracetam/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although EE2 and 4-NP have been detected in marine  shellfish, the kinetics of bioconcentration and their tissue distribution have  not been thoroughly investigated. The authors performed bioconcentration and  depuration experiments in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, with 3.37 nM EE2  (0.999 μg/L) and 454 nM 4-NP (100.138 µg/L). Mussels and seawater were sampled  throughout a 38-d exposure and a 35-d depuration period, and 6 tissues were  individually assayed. Uptake of EE2 and 4-NP was curvilinear throughout exposure  and followed a similar uptake pattern: digestive gland > gill ≥ remaining viscera  > gonad > adductor > plasma. Depuration varied, however, with half-lives ranging  from 2.7 d (plasma) to 92 d (gill) for EE2 and 15 d (plasma) to 57 d (gill) for  4-NP. An innovative modeling approach, with 3 coupled mathematical models, was  developed to differentiate the unique roles of the gill and plasma in  distributing the EDCs to internal tissues. Plasma appears pivotal in regulating  EDC uptake and depuration within the whole mussel.","2016-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","863-873","","4","35","","Environ Toxicol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 SETAC.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26126666","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Carbon Radioisotopes; Half-Life; Tissue Distribution; Environmental Monitoring/*methods; Uptake; Ethinyl Estradiol/*metabolism; Seawater/chemistry; *Organ Specificity; Aquatic Organisms/*metabolism; Depuration; Endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC); Mussel tissue; Mytilus edulis/*metabolism; Organ; Phenols/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study was conducted to investigate  the effect of bosentan on the pharmacokinetics of a combined oral contraceptive.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a randomized, 2-way crossover study, 20 healthy female  subjects received Treatments A and B. Treatment A consisted of a single dose of  OrthoNovum containing 1 mg norethisterone (norethindrone) and 35 microg ethinyl  estradiol. Treatment B consisted of bosentan, 125 mg b.i.d. for 7 days plus  concomitant norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol on Day 7. Plasma concentrations  of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol were measured on days of oral  contraceptive administration. RESULTS: In the absence of bosentan, the  pharmacokinetics of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol were characterized by  Cmax and AUC0-infinity values (95% CI) of 9.8 (8.1, 11.9) ng/ml and 72.9 (57.0,  93.1) ng x h/ml, and 53.0 (47.0, 59.9) pg/ml and 758 (655, 878) pg x h/ml,  respectively. Concomitant bosentan did not affect the Cmax but significantly  decreased the AUC of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol by 13.7% (-23.5, -2.6)  and 31.0% (-40.5,-20.2), respectively. The maximum decrease in AUC of  norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol in an individual subject was 56% and 66%,  respectively.

Two recent  epidemiologic studies infer a lower risk with 30 to 35 mcg than with 50 mcg  estrogen oral contraceptives. However, as with prior studies from which similar  conclusions were drawn, these studies have major flaws, the worst being that all  50 mcg oral contraceptives are lumped together, whereas 50 mcg mestranol oral  contraceptives are actually bioequivalent to 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol oral  contraceptives, thus confounding all such studies. Moreover, while rare  thrombotic events have received inordinate attention, the major protective effect  against endometrial and ovarian cancer that has been shown in older studies among  users of oral contraceptives containing > or = 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol or > or =  80 mcg mestranol are almost totally ignored. The theoretical benefits of using  lower-dose oral contraceptives have not been demonstrated, whereas the protection  against these types of reproductive cancer have been shown repeatedly with  high-dose oral contraceptives but not, to date, with lower-dose oral  contraceptives. Such protection may be diminished by lowering the oral  contraceptive dosage. Should every woman of reproductive age use high-dose oral  contraceptives for 2 years?

All that seems to remain for  users is to look for the right product to satisfy their personal requirements.  The physician takes on the role of the adviser, responsible mainly for errors of  judgement and undesirable effects. The choice of the suitable contraceptive  depends on three factors: the patient profile, the profile of the method used and  the user's life situation. In selecting the method of contraception, statistical  measures such as the Pearl Index, rate of adverse events, risks and health  benefits as well as the pharmacological profile, resulting intake modality and  potential interactions should be considered. The patient profile includes both  subjective wishes and standards of value relevant for world view, family planning  and psychological well-being, as well as objective parameters such as age, BMI,  medical history and the woman's sexual behaviour. Evaluation of these parameters  by the physician is a major component of successful contraceptive counselling.  Belara is a new oral contraceptive on the European market based on a monophasic  combination of 2 mg chlormadinone acetate and 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol. As well  as high contraceptive efficacy and a low rate of side effects, Belara features an  outstanding safety profile due to its almost complete absence of  mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid action and its absent impact on hepatic  metabolism. In daily practice, Belara exhibits mild antiandrogenic activity which  also makes it suitable for users with antiandrogen-induced seborrhoea and  moderate acne. Symptoms of PMS or unspecific dysmenorrhea and menstrual  irregularities can also be alleviated or completely eliminated by taking Belara.  Belara use has not been associated with any significant weight gain. In daily  practice, Belara is suitable for every woman of every age without specific risk  factors requiring safe contraception. Belara also has considerable additional  health benefits that should also be considered when choosing a suitable  contraceptive.","2005","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","19-25","","","10 Suppl 1","","Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16356878","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Quality of Life; Acne Vulgaris/drug therapy; Androgen Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Chlormadinone Acetate/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A randomized, 2-period crossover study was  performed in 10 healthy premenopausal female volunteers. The pharmacokinetic  profiles of plasma concentrations of thalidomide were evaluated with both  noncompartmental and compartmental methods, whereas those of ethinyl estradiol  and norethindrone were calculated with noncompartmental methods. The effects of  steady-state plasma thalidomide concentrations on the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl  estradiol and norethindrone were determined with use of an ANOVA model that  included treatment sequence, subject within sequence, period, and treatment as  factors. RESULTS: Thalidomide plasma concentrations were best predicted by a  1-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination and an absorption  time-lag. There were no significant differences between pharmacokinetic  parameters for thalidomide after 1 dose and those after 18 consecutive doses.  Except for a minor decrease of the elimination rate constant (k(e)) for ethinyl  estradiol, coadministration of thalidomide had no significant effects on the  pharmacokinetic profiles for either ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone. The  change in k(e) for ethinyl estradiol during thalidomide administration was not  associated with any alteration in the clearance or elimination half-life for this  hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of thalidomide is similar to  the single-dose profile. This study did not investigate the efficacy of the  21-day fixed ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone regimen, but the results suggest  that thalidomide is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of orally  administered hormonal contraceptives.","1999-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:12","","483-490","","5","65","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10340913","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Reference Values; Administration, Oral; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Administration Schedule; Hypnotics and Sedatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/*pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacokinetics; Dermatologic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Leprostatic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Thalidomide/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Presently, we examined the influence of pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and  Na(+) or Ca(2+) on the bioavailability and toxicity of waterborne pharmaceuticals  in larval zebrafish. Drugs included sertraline (selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitor; SSRI), fluoxetine (SSRI), diclofenac (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drug) and ethinyl estradiol (estrogen; EE(2)). The 96 h-LC(50)s for sertraline,  fluoxetine and diclofenac were influenced by pH over an environmentally relevant  range (pH 5.8-8.2). Toxicity was related to the predicted concentration of  non-ionized compounds, which more readily cross cell membranes than ionized  compounds. For example, sertraline was 4.1-fold more toxic (as measured by 96  h-LC(50)s) at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8, while the predicted amount of  non-ionized sertraline was also greater at pH 8.2 (based on previously reported  pKa values). Experiments with radiolabelled drugs demonstrated that sertraline  uptake was also 5.4-fold higher at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8. Terrigenous and  autochthonous DOC samples (as low as 1 mg/L) protected against sertraline uptake  and toxicity, although they were more effective at lower (environmentally  relevant) drug concentrations. In contrast, the uptake of EE(2), which was  principally non-ionized in all water chemistries tested, was not altered by pH or  DOC. There was no change in sertraline toxicity with the addition of 12 mM Na(+)  or 3 mM Ca(2+). In conclusion, the influence of pH and DOC on drug uptake and  toxicity in fish appears to be predictable based on the physicochemical  properties of the drug (e.g. pKa, polar surface area). The influence of water  chemistry on drug bioavailability in fish is likely relevant to all aquatic life.","2019-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","11-18","","","210","","Aquat Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to  assess the effect of multiple dosing of the OC norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl  estradiol 0.035 mg (NE/EE) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in  healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of a single  dose of sumatriptan on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of NE and EE, and to  assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. METHODS: This was an  open-label, 1-sequence, crossover study in healthy women who had been receiving  NE/EE for at least 3 months. Subjects received 1 cycle of NE/EE, consisting of 21  days of OC and 7 days of placebo. They also received a single dose of sumatriptan  50 mg on the last day of the OC or placebo regimen. Blood samples for the  determination of plasma sumatriptan concentrations were collected on days 21 and  28, and blood samples for the determination of plasma NE and EE concentrations  were collected on days 20 and 21. Treatments were compared by analysis of  variance. Equivalence between treatments was to be concluded if the 90% Cl for  the ratio of reference to test means for log(e)-transformed parameters (area  under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUCI and maximum measured plasma  concentration [C(max)]) for each analyte fell within the interval 0.80 to 1.25.  RESULTS: Twenty-six women (mean age, 29.8 years; age range, 18-44 years; weight  range, 52-82 kg) participated in the study. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference  to test means for the AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC(infinity)) of sumatriptan  was 1.11 to 1.22, and the 90% CIs for the AUC over the dosing interval at steady  state (AUC(tau)) of NE and EE were 0.96 to 1.00 and 0.91 to 0.97, respectively.  The 90% CIs for the ratio of reference to test means for the C(max) of  sumatriptan, NE, and EE were a respective 1.05 to 1.30, 0.76 to 0.88, and 0.88 to  1.04. Study treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events were mild or moderate,  and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or laboratory  values. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of absorption (AUC) of sumatriptan, NE, and EE  was similar after oral administration of sumatriptan and NE/EE, both alone and in  combination. Thus, in the opinion of the study investigators, there were no  clinically relevant changes in the AUC of any of the medications when sumatriptan  and NE/EE were administered concomitantly compared with administration alone. The  results of this study suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary when  sumatriptan is administered concomitantly with NE/EE in healthy premenopausal  women.","2002-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:10","","1887-1901","","11","24","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12501881","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*blood; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/*blood; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/*blood; Sumatriptan/administration & dosage/*blood; Vasoconstrictor Agents/administration & dosage/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They consist of a progestin (e.g., levonorgestrel (LNG)) and an estrogen  component, typically ethinyl estradiol (EE). In addition to adherence issues,  drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and obesity (women with body mass index  (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ) are prime suspects for decreased LNG efficacy. Therefore, we  developed an integrated physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and  model-based meta-analysis approach to determine LNG's efficacy threshold  concentrations and to evaluate the impact of DDIs and obesity on the efficacy of  LNG-containing hormonal contraceptives (HCs). Based on this approach,  co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers and LNG-containing HCs (LNG150: LNG  150 µg + EE 30 µg and LNG100: LNG 100 µg + EE 20 µg) resulted in a predicted  clinically relevant decrease of LNG plasma exposure (women with BMI < 25 kg/m(2)  : 50-65%; obese women: 70-75%). Following administration of LNG150 or LNG100 in  the presence of a CYP3A4 inducer, there was an increase in mean Pearl Index of  1.2-1.30 and 1.80-2.10, respectively, in women with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (incidence  rate ratios (IRRs): 1.7-2.2), whereas it ranged from 1.6-1.80 and 2.40-2.85 in  obese women (IRR: 2.2-3.0), respectively.

Since the concentrations of EE2 in the serum of women under oral contraceptive  (OC) therapy are in the lower pg-range, highly sensitive and specific analytical  methods are required. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) has been the method of choice, but  evidence of specificity in the presence of the coadministered progestogens and  their metabolites has not always been provided. The present study compares two  radioimmunological methods, which use the same antiserum but different sample  volumes and standard curves (extracted vs. non-extracted), with a newly developed  gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method, in order to cross-validate  the methods. For that purpose, 51 serum samples obtained from women who had been  taking two different combination oral contraceptives were analysed independently  by all three methods. The specificity of the antiserum was further examined by  submitting ex vivo serum samples obtained from OC-users to a combination of high  pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and RIA. The results obtained by the three  methods were very similar and correlation coefficients (r) obtained from linear  regression analysis were about 0.7. There was no interference from the  coadministered progestins on the analysis of EE2 as carried out by the three  methods. There were no metabolites in the extracts of ex vivo serum samples which  showed cross-reactivity with the antiserum used. Modifications of the  radioimmunoassay procedure did not markedly affect the results of EE2  determination.

Serum concentrations of both  sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)  were also measured and were increased more than 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively,  on day 21 of the treatment cycle, with no statistically significant difference  between treatment groups. In addition, 35 days after ingestion of either oral  contraceptive had ceased, the serum SHBG and CBG concentrations were similar to  the pretreatment values. During treatment cycles, increased serum SHBG levels  were associated with a redistribution of 3-ketodesogestrel and gestodene such  that the non-protein-bound (NPB) and albumin-bound fractions were reduced in  concert with an increase in the relative proportions bound to SHBG. The  proportion of gestodene bound to SHBG was consistently higher than that observed  for 3-ketodesogestrel, and this undoubtedly reflects the higher affinity of SHBG  for gestodene (Kd = 1.2 nM at 37 degrees C) when compared to 3-ketodesogestrel  (Kd = 4.7 nM at 37 degrees C). It also probably accounts, in part, for the much  higher total serum levels of gestodene (8.58 nmol/L) when compared to  3-ketodesogestrel (2.37 nmol/L) during the treatment cycles. Consequently, the  absolute amounts of NPB, non-SHBG-bound, and SHBG-bound gestodene are  significantly higher than those measured for 3-ketodesogestrel. It is concluded  that ethinylestradiol-induced increases in serum SHBG levels during treatment  with Marvelon or Femovan, influenced the distribution and total amount of  3-ketodesogestrel and gestodene in serum, respectively, and that this, combined  with the higher affinity of SHBG for gestodene, results in a greater amount of  bioavailable gestodene compared to 3-ketodesogestrel, despite the smaller dose of  gestodene administered.","1994-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:34","","301-318","","4","50","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7813219","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Kinetics; Cross-Over Studies; Biological Availability; Studies; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; *Ethinyl Estradiol; *Research Report; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptive Methods--pharmacodynamics; Oral Contraceptives--pharmacodynamics; *Desogestrel; *Laboratory Procedures; Transcortin/metabolism; *Comparative Studies; Norpregnenes/*blood/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics; *Gestodene; Desogestrel/*blood/pharmacokinetics; *Oral Contraceptives, Combined--pharmacodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, obtaining full concentration-response relationships in animal (in  vivo) exposure studies are laborious, costly and unethical, hence a need for  developing feasible alternative (non-animal) methods. Use of in vitro bioassays  such as primary fish hepatocytes, which retain many of the native properties of  the liver, has been proposed for in vitro screening of estrogen receptor (ER)  agonists and antagonists. The aim of present study was to characterize the  molecular mode of action (MoA) of the ER agonist 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in  primary rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes. A custom designed  salmonid 60,000-feature (60k) oligonucleotide microarray was used to characterize  the potential MoAs after 48h exposure to EE2. The microarray analysis revealed  several concentration-dependent gene expression alterations including classical  estrogen sensitive biomarker gene expression (e.g. estrogen receptor α,  vitellogenin, zona radiata). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis displayed  transcriptional changes suggesting interference of cellular growth, fatty acid  and lipid metabolism potentially mediated through the estrogen receptor (ER),  which were proposed to be associated with modulation of genes involved in  endocrine function and reproduction. Pathway analysis supported the identified  GOs and revealed modulation of additional genes associated with apoptosis and  cholesterol biosynthesis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to  impaired lipid metabolism (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and  γ), growth (e.g. insulin growth factor protein 1), phase I and II  biotransformation (e.g. cytochrome P450 1A, sulfotransferase,  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and glutathione S-transferase) provided additional  insight into the MoA of EE2 in primary fish hepatocytes. Results from the present  study suggest that biotransformation, estrogen receptor-mediated responses, lipid  homeostasis, growth and cancer/apoptosis in primary fish hepatocytes may be  altered after short-term exposure to ER-agonists such as EE2. In many cases the  observed changes were similar to those reported for estrogen-exposed fish in  vivo. In conclusion, global transcriptional analysis demonstrated that EE2  affected a number of toxicologically relevant pathways associated with an  estrogenic MoA in the rainbow trout hepatocytes.","2015-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","90-104","","","169","","Aquat Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When drugs such as ethinyl  estradiol and norethindrone undergo this process, part of an orally administered  dose is inactivated, which results in wide ranges of bioavailability. In  connection with this process, these drugs are also susceptible to various  drug-to-drug interactions. Levonorgestrel is not subject to first-pass extraction  by the liver, which results in virtually 100% bioavailability. It is unclear  whether interpopulation variations in blood levels result from ethnic,  geographic, nutritional, or other phenomena. Hepatic mechanisms are qualitatively  different as demonstrated by striking differences in urinary patterns of ethinyl  estradiol conjugates and hydroxylations of ethinyl estradiol from country to  country.","1989-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1260-1264","","5 Pt 2","160","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2497645","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Biological Availability; Levonorgestrel; Norgestrel/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Norethindrone/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it  has been associated with an increase in the risk of liver cancers and injury. The  carcinogenic properties of 17-EE are similar to that of other estrogens, but the  molecular mechanism of liver injury is still unclear. It is important to identify  any secondary toxic mechanisms that can be used to prevent or treat the toxicity.  The LC50 of 17-EE toward isolated rat hepatocytes was determined to be 150 ± 8  μmol/L. Accelerated cytotoxicity mechanism screening (ACMS) techniques using  isolated rat hepatocytes showed that CYP1A inhibitors decreased cytotoxicity,  whereas tyrosinase increased toxicity; this suggests that the toxic mechanism  involved is the oxidation of 17-EE. A hepatocyte inflammation model also  increased 17-EE-induced mitochondrial toxicity, as well as the formation of ROS  and H2O2. Cytotoxicity was increased when inhibitors of quinone reduction,  catechol-O-methylation, glucuronidation, glutathione conjugation, and sulfation  were co-incubated with 17-EE. The hepatocytes could be rescued with antioxidants  and quinone trapping agents, thereby suggesting a role for quinoid moiety induced  oxidative stress in 17-EE induced cytotoxicity. These mechanisms for 17-EE  hepatotoxicity could provide a new perspective for the treating 17-EE-induced  liver injury.","2014-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","21-26","","1","92","","Can J Physiol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 24383869","","","","Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; In Vitro Techniques; Oxidative Stress; Antioxidants/pharmacology; Glutathione/metabolism; Inflammation/metabolism; Metabolic Detoxication, Phase II; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism/*toxicity; Cytotoxins/metabolism/*toxicity; Estrogens/metabolism/*toxicity; Hepatocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This was an open-label parallel design of a single dose followed  by a multiple dose period in healthy young Japanese and Caucasian subjects.  RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of Org 30659 after single dosing was  increased by a factor of 1.75 [90% confidence interval (CI): 1.48-2.08] in  Japanese women compared to Caucasian women. At steady state, this difference  increased to a factor of 1.90 (90% CI: 1.60-2.25). The AUC of EE after single  dosing was similar in Caucasian and Japanese women, but at steady state it was  increased by a factor 1.38 (90% CI: 1.15-1.64) in the Japanese group. Weight  normalization reduced, but did not remove, all the observed differences. Sex  hormone binding globulin played no significant role in the differences between  Caucasian and Japanese subjects. Both the single- and multiple-dose treatments  with Org 30659/EE were generally well tolerated by all subjects. The Japanese  population reported more and different treatment-related adverse events than the  Caucasian population. CONCLUSIONS: The peak concentration and extent of exposure  of Org 30659, and to a lesser extent of EE, in Japanese women are higher than in  Caucasian women. Furthermore, the peak concentration and extent of exposure at  steady state of Org 30659, and to a lesser extent of EE, are higher than would be  predicted assuming linear pharmacokinetics over time.

STUDY DESIGN: In this randomized, double-blind, 2-way crossover study, healthy  women received single 7-day application of both test and reference patches.  Treatment phase included two treatment periods of 11 days each separated by a  21-day washout period starting from day of patch removal (day 8) of treatment  period 1. Assessments included NGMN and EE pharmacokinetics (PK), adhesion using  European Medicines Agency (EMA) 5-point scale, irritation potential and  application-site reactions, and safety. Patches were bioequivalent if 90% CIs of  ratios of means of test/reference for AUC(168h), AUC(inf), and C(ss) fell within  80-125%. Patch adhesion was comparable if ratios of mean cumulative adhesion  percentage values of test/reference were ≥90.0%. RESULTS: Seventy women were  randomized; 57 completed both treatments with ≥80% adhesion (score 0-1).  Bioequivalence of test and reference patches was demonstrated as 90% CI of ratio  of geometric means for AUC(168h), AUC(inf), and C(ss) for NGMN and EE fell within  80-125%. Both patches had similar adhesion properties (geometric mean ratio was  100.3% [90% CI, 93.2-107.9]). Similar rates of mild-to-moderate itching (11% vs  10%) and erythema events (79% vs 74%) were reported for test and reference  patches, respectively, on day 8.

The present study employed  radiolabeled EE2 to examine impacts of temperature and salinity on EE2 uptake in  male killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Fish were exposed to a nominal  concentration of 100ng/L EE2 for 2h. The rate of EE2 uptake was constant over the  2h period. Oxygen consumption rates (MO(2)), whole body uptake rates, and  tissue-specific EE2 distribution were determined. In killifish acclimated to 18°C  at 16ppt (50% sea water), MO(2) and EE2 uptake were both lower after 24h exposure  to 10°C and 4°C, and increased after 24h exposure to 26°C. Transfer to fresh  water (FW) for 24h lowered EE2 uptake rate, and long-term acclimation to fresh  water reduced it by 70%. Both long-term acclimation to 100% sea water (32ppt) and  a 24h transfer to 100% sea water also reduced EE2 uptake rate by 50% relative to  16ppt. Tissue-specific accumulation of EE2 was highest (40-60% of the total) in  the liver plus gall bladder across all exposures, and the vast majority of this  was in the bile at 2h, regardless of temperature or salinity. The carcass was the  next highest accumulator (30-40%), followed by the gut (10-20%) with only small  amounts in gill and spleen. Killifish chronically exposed (15 days) to 100ng/L  EE2 displayed no difference in EE2 uptake rate or tissue-specific distribution.  Drinking rate, measured with radiolabeled polyethylene glycol-4000, was about 25  times greater in 16ppt-acclimated killifish relative to FW-acclimated animals.  However, drinking accounted for less than 30% of gut accumulation, and therefore  a negligible percentage of whole body EE2 uptake rates. In general, there were  strong positive relationships between EE2 uptake rates and MO(2), suggesting  similar uptake pathways of these lipophilic molecules across the gills. These  data will be useful in developing a predictive model of how key environmental  parameter variations (salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) affect EE2 uptake  in estuarine fish, to determine optimal timing and location of WWTP discharges.","2013-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","61-71","","","127","","Aquat Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

All sorption isotherms were nonlinear and fitted both Freundlich and  Dubinin-Ashtakhov (DA) models. The single-point organic carbon (OC)-normalized  distribution coefficient (K(OC)) of EE2 for the isolated NHC and BC was 2.7-4.8  times and 5.4-12.9 times greater, respectively, than that of the bulk samples.  However, no clear trend in BPA K(OC) values was observed. Based on the  contribution of soil/sediment organic matter (SOM) fractions to the overall  sorption of BPA or EE2 by the bulk samples, condensed SOM (NHC and BC) generally  played a dominant role to the overall sorption. The BPA adsorption capacity  (Q(OC)(0)) from the DA model was higher than that of EE2 on NHC and there was  obvious difference in isotherm nonlinearity (n) between EE2 and BPA. These  results suggest that BPA may have more access to the pore sites of NHC samples  than EE2. The pi-pi bonds formed between BPA and NHC or BC may be stronger than  that between EE2 and NHC or BC. This would be attributed to the fact that BPA has  two benzene rings, and can also be used to explain the difference in  hexadecane-water partition coefficient (K(HW))-normalized K(OC) values  (K(OC)/K(HW)) of BPA and EE2 after factoring out the hydrophobic effect. These  findings could be useful for predicting fate and ecological risks of endocrine  disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (e.g., EE2 and BPA) in natural environments  especially when soils or sediments become receptors for EDCs.","2010-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","709-715","","7","80","","Chemosphere","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This is in contrast to previously reported inhibitory  effects of PQ on the metabolism of antipyrine.","1984-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:24:51","","289-295","","3","30","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6439467","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Biology; Physiology; Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Contraceptive Agents; Family Planning; Levonorgestrel; Contraceptive Methods--pharmacodynamics; *Contraception; *Ethinyl Estradiol--administraction and dosage; *Reproductive Control Agents; Contraceptive Agents--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--administraction and dosage; Endocrine System; *Contraceptive Agents, Female; *Hormones; *Oral Contraceptives--pharmacodynamics; *Treatment; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood; Contraceptives, Oral/*blood; Norgestrel/blood; *Diseases; *Levonorgestrel--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--administraction and dosage; *Parasitic Diseases; Chloroquine/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*blood; Primaquine/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when combined, complex mixtures may provoke unexpected effects even at  low amounts. Selected aquatic micropollutants such as chlorpyrifos,  bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and  17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were tested singly and in mixtures at nM to μM  concentrations using precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) of Atlantic cod (Gadus  morhua). Fish liver is a target organ for contaminants due to its crucial role in  detoxification processes. In order to understand the effects on distinct key  liver metabolic pathways, transcription levels of various genes were measured,  including cyp1a1 and cyp3a, involved in the metabolism of organic compounds,  including toxic ones, and the catabolism of bile acids and steroid hormones;  cyp7a1, fabp and hmg-CoA, involved in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis; cyp24a1,  involved in vitamin D metabolism; and vtg, a key gene in xenoestrogenic response.  Only EE2 had significant effects on gene expression in cod liver slices when  exposed singly at the concentrations tested. However, when exposed in  combinations, effects not detected in single exposure conditions arose,  suggesting complex interactions between studied pollutants that could not be  predicted from the results of individual exposure scenarios. Thus, the present  work highlights the importance of assessing mixtures when describing the toxic  effects of micropollutants to fish liver metabolism.","2016-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","395-404","","","177","","Aquat Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The potential drug interaction between COBI-boosted PIs and  hormonal contraceptives, which are substrates of intestinal efflux transporters  and extensively metabolized by CYP enzymes, glucuronidation and sulfation, was  evaluated. METHODS: This was a Phase I, open-label, two cohort (n=18/cohort),  fixed-sequence study in healthy females that evaluated the drug-drug interaction  (DDI) between multiple-dose ATV+COBI or DRV+COBI and single-dose  drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol (EE). DDIs were evaluated using 90% confidence  intervals of the geometric least-squares mean ratios of the test  (drospirenone/EE+boosted PI) versus reference (drospirenone/EE) using lack of DDI  boundaries of 70-143%. Safety was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: 29/36  participants completed the study. Relative to drospirenone/EE alone, drospirenone  area under the plasma concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity  (AUC(inf)) was 1.6-fold and 2.3-fold higher, and maximum observed plasma  concentration (C(max)) was unaltered, upon coadministration with DRV+COBI and  ATV+COBI, respectively. EE AUC(inf) decreased 30% with drospirenone/EE + DRV+COBI  and was unchanged with ATV+COBI + drospirenone/EE, relative to drospirenone/EE  alone. Study treatments were generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse  events were mild and consistent with known safety profiles of the compounds.  CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with COBI-mediated CYP3A inhibition, drospirenone  exposure increased following coadministration with COBI-containing regimens, with  a greater increase with ATV+COBI. Thus, clinical monitoring for  drospirenone-associated hyperkalaemia is recommended with DRV+COBI and ATV+COBI  should not be used with drospirenone. Lower EE exposure with DRV+COBI may be  attributed to inductive effects of DRV on CYP enzymes and/or intestinal efflux  transporters (that is, P-gp) involved in EE disposition.","2019","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:35:56","","557-566","","8","24","","Antivir Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31933482","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Cohort Studies; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Young Adult; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Androstenes/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Atazanavir Sulfate/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Cobicistat/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Darunavir/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some analogs induce the cytochrome P450 family  of oxidative enzymes. Ethinyl estradiol (EE), commonly found in oral  contraceptives (OCs), is a known CYP3A4 substrate. OBJECTIVE: To determine the  potential effect of rifaximin on EE and norgestimate pharmacokinetics. METHODS:  In an open-label, crossover study, healthy females received a single dose of OC  (EE 0.07 mg/norgestimate 0.50 mg). Following a 1 week washout period, individuals  received rifaximin 200 mg every 8 hours for 3 days, with a single dose of OC  administered with the ninth rifaximin dose. During both treatment periods, blood  samples were collected periodically for up to 96 hours after each OC dose. Plasma  concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters were characterized for  EE and 2 major metabolites of norgestimate, norgestrel (NG) and 17-deacetyl  norgestimate (17-DNGM). A drug-drug interaction was confirmed if the 90% CI for  the 2 treatment period comparison was outside the 80-125% limit. RESULTS:  Twenty-six of 28 women completed the study. No differences in pharmacokinetic  parameters were observed for EE, NG, or 17-DNGM when a single dose of the OC was  administered alone or with rifaximin. In addition, the 90% CI for the  bioavailability contrasts (OC alone vs OC with rifaximin) for the maximum plasma  concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the  last measurable plasma concentration or to infinity for EE, NG, and 17-DNGM all  ranged from 86-118%. These intervals were within the predefined range for  equivalence; therefore, no interaction was observed between OC and rifaximin.  Rifaximin was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of a 3 day dosing  regimen of oral rifaximin was well tolerated and did not alter the  pharmacokinetics of a commonly used combination OC containing EE and  norgestimate.","2007-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:40:44","","222-228","","2","41","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17284510","","","","Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Cross-Over Studies; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Drug Interactions; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; Rifamycins/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology; Rifaximin; Therapeutic Equivalency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fused material was then mixed with  lactose as vehicle. Soft gelatin capsules were filled with 50 mg of the final  mixture to give 0.050 mg of ethinylestradiol. Six female volunteers received, one  capsule of the eutectic combination of EE:CHOL or one 50 micrograms tablet of  ethinylestradiol (Dianor, Syntex), in a cross-over study and in fasting state.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a single-centre, open-label,  crossover, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence study in which non-micronized DRSP  4 mg or a combination of DRSP 3 mg and EE 0.02 mg were administered to healthy  female subjects on day 1 to obtain a single-dose kinetic profile, and from day 4  to day 15 to obtain a repeated-dose kinetic profile. The maximum observed  concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration/time curve (AUC) were  determined in a model-independent way using non dose corrected data. Statistical  analysis was based on a parametric method (ANOVA-log). RESULTS: A total of 24  healthy female subjects were randomized 1:1 into the study. The mean relative,  non-dose-corrected PK estimates after single-dose administration for the  endpoints AUC((0-72h)), AUC((0-24h)) and C(max) were 543.5 ng*h/mL, 296.1 ng*h/mL  and 27.3 ng/mL for DRSP alone, and 442.0 ng*h/mL, 264.7 ng*h/mL and 37.5 ng/mL  for the DRSP/EE combination; p < 0.001. The mean relative, non-dose-corrected PK  estimates after repeated dose administration for the endpoints AUC((0-72h)),  AUC((0-24h)) and C(max) were 1066.8 ng*h/ml, 570.2 ng*h/mL and 41.0 ng/mL for  DRSP alone, and 1394.5 ng*h/mL, 732.8 ng*h/mL and 61.4 ng/mL for the DRSP/EE  combination; p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: DRSP alone exhibits a lower accumulation  ratio than together with EE. The extent of systemic exposure at steady-state is  about 32% less with the new formulation (AUC((0-24h)), steady-state geometric  mean ratio: 77.8%; 90% confidence interval: 74.6%-81.1%). This PK profile may be  caused by EE. IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that metabolic pathways of DRSP  can be inhibited by EE resulting in higher DRSP plasma concentrations in DRSP/EE  formulations than in a DRSP-alone formulation. The enzymes CYP3A4 and SULT1A1 may  play a role. Additional drug-drug-interaction studies are needed to better  understand these metabolic pathways and their future clinical implications.","2020-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:53","","137-143","","2","101","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Transdermal contraception: no tangible progress.","Prescrire international","","1167-7422","","","(1) The reference hormone-based contraceptive for women is an oral contraceptive combining ethinylestradiol (about 30 micrograms) and a well-known progestin such  as levonorgestrel or norethisterone. (2) A transdermal contraceptive patch  delivering 20 micrograms of ethinylestradiol and 150 micrograms of norelgestromin  over 24 hours, and designed to be left in place for a whole week, three weeks a  month, has recently been marketed in France. (3) Norelgestromin is the active  metabolite of norgestimate, which is already available in combined contraceptives  but is less well evaluated than some other progestins. Norelgestromin is  metabolised by the liver, notably into norgestrel. (4) The clinical evaluation  dossier of the new transdermal contraceptive contains data from two comparative  unblinded trials, one versus a triphasic combination of oral ethinylestradiol +  levonorgestrel, and the other versus oral ethinyl estradiol (20 micrograms) +  desogestrel. A third, non comparative trial offers weaker evidence. These three  trials included about 3300 women in total, and lasted between 6 and 13 cycles.  The patch was about as effective as the comparator contraceptives. (5) In the  three main clinical trials, 4.7% of patches had to be replaced because they  became unstuck, either completely (1.8%) or partially (2.9%). (6) More women  dropped out of the groups using patches (19.9% of the patch group compared with  14.5% of the group taking oral contraceptives in one trial, 29.6% versus 24.3% in  the other trial). Women using the patch were more likely than other women to stop  their treatment because of adverse events (about 12% versus 5%). (7) Breast  discomfort, breast tenderness or pain were reported by 22% of women using the  patches and by 9% and 6% of women in the two comparator groups. Women using the  patches had slightly longer menstrual periods (5.6 days versus 4.7 days).  Reactions at the patch site were reported by 17% of women. (8) There is no  evidence that the patch is any less likely than reference oral contraceptives to  cause thromboembolism. The true thromboembolic risk associated with the new  patches is unknown. (9) Used patches still contain large amounts of active  substances, and must be placed in sachets (provided in the packet) and taken to a  pharmacy for disposal. (10) In practice, the reference combined contraceptive for  women is still oral ethinylestradiol (about 30 micrograms) plus a well-known  progestin such as levonorgestrel or norethisterone. Ethinylestradiol +  norelgestromin patches offer women no real benefits: they are probably less  convenient and may be less safe.","2004-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","123-126","","72","13","","Prescrire Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 15532134","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; France; Women's Health; Administration, Cutaneous; Menstrual Cycle/drug effects; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Contraceptive Agents, Female/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Device Approval; Estrogens/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They received either placebo or 2400 mg/day  felbamate from midcycle (day 15) to midcycle (day 14) of two consecutive oral  contraceptive cycles (months 1 and 2). Pharmacokinetic assessments of ethinyl  estradiol and gestodene were performed on day 14 of both cycles. To determine  whether ovulation occurred, plasma progesterone and urinary luteinizing hormone  levels were measured, and diaries recording vaginal bleeding were kept. Felbamate  treatment resulted in a significant 42% decrease in gestodene area under the  plasma concentration-time curve (0 to 24 hours) (p = 0.018) compared with  baseline, whereas a minor but not clinically relevant effect was observed on the  pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol. There were no changes in the  pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol or gestodene after placebo treatment. No  volunteer showed hormonal evidence of ovulation; however, one volunteer reported  the onset of intermenstrual bleeding during felbamate treatment. Because of the  effect of felbamate on the pharmacokinetics of gestodene and the report of  intermenstrual bleeding, it is possible that the contraceptive efficacy of  low-dose combination oral contraceptives may be adversely affected during  felbamate treatment.","1995-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:03","","523-531","","5","58","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7586946","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Norpregnenes/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Estradiol Congeners/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Felbamate; Phenylcarbamates; Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased removal of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) has been  reported for activated sludge treatment with long enough solids retention time  for nitrification. Previous work based on batch tests with Nitrosomonas europaea  and nitrifying activated sludge at high EE2 concentrations (>300 000 ng/L) and  high NH4-N concentrations (>200 mg/L) has led to the hypothesis that ammonia  oxidizing bacteria cometabolically degrade EE2. This work investigated EE2  transformation with N. europaea and Nitrosospira multiformis at environmentally  relevant EE2 concentrations and LC-MS-MS to observe transformation products.  Degradation of EE2 was not observed in batch tests with no NH4-N addition or with  10 mg/L NH4-N fed daily. At increased NH4-N concentrations (200-500 mg/L) EE2  transformation was observed, but the only detected products were nitrated EE2.  Abiotic assays with growth medium confirmed EE2 removal by nitration, which is  enhanced at low pH and high NO2-N concentrations. These results suggest that EE2  removal at low concentrations found in municipal treatment activated sludge  systems is not due to cometabolic degradation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria, or  to abiotic nitration, but most likely due to heterotrophic bacteria.","2008-10-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","7622-7627","","20","42","","Environ Sci Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18983084","","","","Kinetics; Time Factors; Biotransformation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Biological Assay; Biodegradation, Environmental; Nitrates/*metabolism; Ammonia/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/chemistry/*metabolism; Nitrosomonas europaea/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In  session 1, participants received 35 microg EE and 1.0 mg NE from days 1 to 21. In  session 2, participants received the same oral contraceptive treatment as in  session 1 on days 1 to 21 plus DRV/r (600 mg/100 mg twice daily) on days 1 to 14.  Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on day 14 for each session. RESULTS:  Steady-state systemic exposure to EE and NE decreased when DRV/r was  co-administered, based on the ratio of least square means of the minimum plasma  concentration (Cmin), the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and the area under  the curve (AUC24h) of EE (which decreased by 62%, 32% and 44%, respectively) and  NE (which decreased by 30%, 10% and 14%, respectively) compared with  administration of EE and NE alone. Five participants discontinued the study due  to grade 2 cutaneous events, as required per protocol, during treatment with EE  and NE in combination with DRV/r. There were no clinically relevant findings for  laboratory and cardiovascular parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetic  interaction observed here is considered to be clinically relevant as EE  concentrations are considerably reduced when DRV/r is co-administered with EE and  NE. Alternative or additional contraceptive measures should be used when  oestrogen-based contraceptives are co-administered with DRV/r.","2008","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:31","","563-569","","4","13","","Antivir Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18672535","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Therapy, Combination; HIV Seronegativity; Darunavir; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; HIV Protease Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Ritonavir/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The radioactive dose of tritiated NETO was 20 microCi/kg for  both treatments. For i.v. injection, a 30% propylene glycol/water solution and  for i.g. administration an aqueous microcrystalline suspension was used.  Excretion of radiolabel in urine and feces was followed for 5 days and plasma  samples were obtained up to 2 days after administrations. In all samples (urine,  feces and plasma) radioactivity was determined. Extracts from plasma samples were  subjected to HPLC separation of drug and metabolites, as well as NETO and NET  (metabolite of NETO after hydrolysis of the oxime group) levels were determined.  In addition, EE2 (ethinylestradiol, A-ring aromatised metabolite of NET) levels  were estimated using a specifically designed HPLC system for separation.  Quantification of EE2 was achieved by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of specific eluate  fractions. The results demonstrate that [3H]-NETO was absorbed completely at a  dose level of 1 mg/kg, and excreted predominantly via the kidneys. A urinary to  fecal excretion ratio of 1.5 (i.v.) or 1.0 (i.g.) was found. Renal excretion of  total radiolabel proceeded with a half-life of about 0.8 (i.v.) or 1.1 (i.g.)  days. Balances were incomplete, probably due to technical reasons. Orally  administered NETO was highly bioavailable (84.0 +/- 16.9% of dose) but rapidly  cleared from plasma (total clearance corresponded to 97% of plasma liver flow).  The clearance from plasma is equivalent to the metabolic clearance because almost  no unchanged NETO is excreted. Extensive metabolism of the parent drug was  observed leading to at least two pharmacologically active metabolites (NET, EE2).  The main progestogenic metabolite was NET reaching similar high plasma levels as  NETO. EE2 turned out to be a metabolite of NETO and a conversion rate of below  0.5% of dose was estimated. However, due to its high estrogenic potency EE2 might  contribute to the overall pharmacological pattern of NETO in the cynomolgus  monkey.","1992-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:26","","281-291","","4","17","","Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 1301358","","","","Female; Animals; Biological Availability; Hydrolysis; Absorption; Macaca fascicularis; Progesterone Congeners/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood; Norethindrone/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum levels of EE and LNG were determined after  single and repeated daily oral administration over three treatment cycles, each  consisting of 21 treatment days followed by a 7-day treatment-free period.  Additionally, the time courses of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),  corticoid-binding globulin (CBG) and total and free testosterone serum levels  were analyzed. Both active ingredients were rapidly absorbed and maximum  concentrations in serum were reached between, on average, 1 and 2 h after single  and multiple administrations, respectively. Concentrations of EE increased during  repeated daily administration. An approximate two-fold accumulation was  calculated based on the comparison of EE area under the curve (AUC) (0-24 h)  values determined after the first and the last tablet administration within a  treatment cycle. LNG serum concentrations also increased during repeated daily  administration, reaching steady-state levels after about 11 days. Based on the  comparison of AUC (0-24 h) values determined after the first and the last tablet  administration, LNG accumulated approximately by a factor of 3 within a treatment  cycle. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of LNG were similar at the end of the first  and the third treatment cycles, indicating no further accumulation of LNG beyond  a treatment cycle under long-term use of this combined oral contraceptive. The  clearance and volume of distribution of LNG decreased and the terminal half-life  increased after repeated daily administration, compared with single  administration. These effects have also been reported for other LNG/EE  combinations. SHBG serum concentrations increased during repeated daily intake  by, on average, 1.5-1.6-fold, and for CBG, an average increase of 1.4-1.8-fold  was found. Although free testosterone concentrations declined during repeated  daily administration by about 40%, total testosterone remained relatively  unchanged at a low level. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of EE and LNG  determined in the present study were in good agreement with those previously  reported for 30 microg EE + 150 microg LNG, taking the 33% dose reduction into  account.","2002-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:28:23","","79-90","","2","7","","Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12201326","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Liver/metabolism; Testosterone/blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Serum Albumin/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Progesterone Congeners/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The treatment has a positive estrogenic effect on  bone, the cardiovascular system, and vagina but is dependent of the  estrogen-progestagen balance in uterus to prevent unwanted proliferation. We were  interested in the influence of estrogens and progestagens on estrogen metabolism  in target tissues of estrogen replacement therapy. Therefore, we studied the  metabolism of estradiol, 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, and moxestrol  (11beta-methoxy-17alpha-ethynylestradiol) in rat uterus, vagina, and aorta. In  uterus and vagina, estradiol was converted to estrone, estradiol-3-glucuronide,  and estrone-3-glucuronide. These metabolites demonstrate the presence of  17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase  (UDP-GT) in uterus and vagina. We found that the conversion of estradiol by  17beta-HSD in uterus was increased in animals treated with estradiol or with a  combination of estradiol and progesterone. The conversion of estradiol in uterus  by UDP-GT was estradiol-induced and in contrast, progesterone-suppressed. In the  vagina, steroid hormone treatment had no effect on estradiol conversion by  17beta-HSD or UDP-GT. Ethynylestradiol was glucuronidated only, and this was not  affected by steroid treatment. Moxestrol was not converted in any of the three  organs that were studied, indicating that the 11beta-methoxy substituent renders  it a poor substrate for glucuronidation. Overall, the estrogen metabolism, and  its regulation by sex steroids, in rat uterus is different compared with human  uterus. Therefore, the rat may not be the best-suited model to investigate  uterine effects of estradiol-progestagen combined treatment.","2001-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","76-81","","1","29","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11124233","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Organ Size; Rats, Wistar; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Aorta/*metabolism; Estradiol/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics; Progesterone/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Uterus/*drug effects/metabolism; Vagina/*drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Others believe that  ethinyl estradiol exerts its hepatic effects because of its chemical composition,  specifically its 17 alpha-ethinyl group. In an attempt to resolve this  controversy, a study was undertaken to determine whether vaginal administration  of ethinyl estradiol can selectively reduce the hepatic effects of oral ethinyl  estradiol. To compare the effects of oral and vaginal ethinyl estradiol, a group  of postmenopausal subjects received either 5 micrograms of oral and 20 micrograms  of vaginal ethinyl estradiol or 10 micrograms of oral and 50 micrograms of  vaginal ethinyl estradiol in either sequence, respectively. Oral ethinyl  estradiol was four to five times more potent than vaginal ethinyl estradiol. The  potency ratios of the oral-vaginal ethinyl estradiol doses required to suppress  follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were 4.4 and 3.2 and those  to raise sex hormone-binding globulin binding capacity, corticosteroid-binding  globulin binding capacity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as  lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 3.5, 5.0, 4.2, and 4.2,  respectively. These essentially equal oral-vaginal route potency ratios for both  central nervous system and hepatic effects indicate that vaginal administration  of ethinyl estradiol does not selectively reduce its hepatic impact in relation  to its central nervous system effects. The pronounced hepatic effects of ethinyl  estradiol are therefore attributed to its chemical composition.","1985-04-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","868-877","","7","151","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3920910","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Administration, Oral; Biology; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Biological Availability; Physiology; Studies; Liver/*drug effects/metabolism; Triglycerides/blood; Cholesterol, LDL/blood; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Luteinizing Hormone/blood; Lipoproteins, LDL/blood; Contraception; Family Planning; *Cholesterol; Suppositories; *Adrenal Cortex Hormones; *Ethinyl Estradiol--administraction and dosage; *Reproductive Control Agents; Contraceptive Agents--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Female--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--administraction and dosage; *Comparative Studies; Endocrine System; *Hepatic Effects; *Hormones; *Diseases; *Metabolic Effects; *Glucose Metabolism Effects; *Carbohydrate Metabolic Effects; *Follicle Stimulating Hormone; *Gonadotropins; *Gonadotropins, Pituitary; *Lipids; *Luteinizing Hormone; *Organic Chemicals; *Research Methodology; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology; Ingredients And Chemicals; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/blood; Transcortin/blood; Vagina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we aimed to determine the  responsiveness of ZP2 and ZP3 to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in adult rare minnow  Gobiocypris rarus. The full length of ZP3 cDNA was firstly characterized and its  tissue distribution revealed that ZP3 mRNA was predominantly expressed in ovary  of G. rarus. The gene expression profiles of ZP2, ZP3 and vitellogenin (VTG) were  analyzed in gonad and liver of adult G. rarus exposed to EE2 at 1, 5, 25, and 125  ng/L for 3 and 6 days. The results show that ZP2 is more sensitive than ZP3 in  gonads of both genders, and VTG in liver is extremely sensitive to EE2 in male  fish. However, at lower concentrations (1 and 5 ng/L), the ZP2 in testes shows  higher responsiveness to EE2 compared with VTG in rare minnow. The 5' flanking  regions of ZP2 and ZP3 were isolated and the comparison of transcription factors  in the regions of ZP2 and ZP3 suggested that the disparity for the responsiveness  of ZP2 and ZP3 to EE2 could partly be a result of differential cis-elements such  as oocyte-specific protein (Osp1) binding sites or/and sex-determining region Y  (SRY) binding site.","2013-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1-9","","1","158","","Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective was to study the effect of combined OCs, containing  ethinyl estradiol (INN, ethinylestradiol) and gestodene, on CYP1A2 activity, as  well as their interaction potential with tizanidine. METHODS: In a parallel-group  study, 15 healthy women using OCs and 15 healthy women without OCs (control  subjects) ingested a single dose of 4 mg tizanidine. Plasma and urine  concentrations of tizanidine, as well as several of its metabolites (M-3, M-4,  M-5, M-9, and M-10), and pharmacodynamic variables were measured until 24 hours  after dosing. As a marker of CYP1A2 activity, an oral caffeine test was performed  in both groups. RESULTS: The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve  from time 0 to infinity [AUC0-infinity] of tizanidine was 3.9 times greater  (P<.001) and the mean peak plasma tizanidine concentration (Cmax) was 3.0 times  higher (P<.001) in the OC users than in the control subjects. In 1 OC user the  AUC0-infinity of tizanidine exceeded the mean AUC0-infinity of the control  subjects by nearly 20 times. There were no significant differences in the  elimination half-life or time to peak concentration in plasma of tizanidine  between the groups. Tizanidine/metabolite ratios in plasma (M-3 and M-4) and  urine (M-3, M-4, M-5, M-9, and M-10) were 2 to 10 times higher in the users of  OCs than in the control subjects. In the OC group the excretion of unchanged  tizanidine into urine was, on average, 3.8 times greater (P=.008) than in the  control subjects. The plasma caffeine/paraxanthine ratio was 2.8 times higher  (P<.001) in the OC users than in the control subjects. The caffeine/paraxanthine  ratio correlated significantly with the AUC0-infinity and peak concentration of  tizanidine in plasma, with its excretion into urine, and with, for example, the  tizanidine/M-3 and tizanidine/M-4 area under the plasma concentration-time curve  ratios. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lowered by  tizanidine more in the OC users (-29+/- 10 mm Hg and -21+/- 8 mm Hg,  respectively) than in the control subjects (-17+/- 9 mm Hg and -13+/- 5 mm Hg,  respectively) (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: OCs containing ethinyl estradiol and  gestodene increase, to a clinically significant extent, the plasma concentrations  and effects of tizanidine, probably mainly by inhibiting its CYP1A2-mediated  presystemic metabolism. Care should be exercised when tizanidine is prescribed to  OC users.","2005-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:11","","400-411","","4","78","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16198659","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Synergism; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Caffeine/blood; Clonidine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Norpregnenes/*pharmacology; Theophylline/blood; *Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Thirty-day, open-label, fixed-sequence, pharmacokinetic  drug-drug interaction study. SETTING: Single clinical phase I center.  PARTICIPANTS: Twenty nonpregnant and nonlactating women aged 19-45 years who were  taking a norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptive. INTERVENTION: Each  woman received norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol alone on study days 1-22, followed  by norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol plus tenofovir DF 300 mg once/day for 7 days  during two consecutive 28-day contraceptive cycles. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN  RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed over 24 hours on study days 1  and 29 (corresponding to matching days [day 21] of the two contraceptive cycles).  Serum or plasma concentrations of tenofovir, norgestimate and its active  metabolite deacetyl norgestimate, and ethinyl estradiol were measured by  high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays. Geometric  mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for the pharmacokinetic parameters for  deacetyl norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol were estimated by using analysis of  variance and compared with the no-effect criterion for bioequivalence. The  tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with historical controls.  Pharmacokinetic parameters for deacetyl norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol were  unaltered by coadministration of tenofovir DF. The tenofovir pharmacokinetic  parameters in subjects receiving norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol were consistent  with historical control data for tenofovir. CONCLUSION: Tenofovir DF and  norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol are not involved in a clinically significant  drug-drug interaction; tenofovir DF did not affect the steady-state  pharmacokinetics of norgestimate or ethinyl estradiol, including the  concentration at the end of the dosing interval. Both drugs were well tolerated  when coadministered. Tenofovir DF is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of  hormonal oral contraceptives.","2009-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:32:58","","924-929","","8","29","","Pharmacotherapy","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19637945","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Drug Combinations; Tenofovir; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Norgestrel/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Anti-HIV Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Organophosphonates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: This was an open-label, randomized, crossover,  drug-drug interaction study conducted over three menstrual cycles in healthy  women with regular menses. We compared systemic exposure to NES and EE by  determining area under the curve (AUC(8-21d)) with CVR only and CVR with each  miconazole treatment. Three different miconazole formulations (single-dose  suppository, multiple-dose suppository or multiple-dose cream) were administered  in a single dose on day 8 or multiple doses on days 8-10 after CVR insertion. We  evaluated safety and tolerability of the CVR in the presence of antimycotic  comedication. RESULTS: Forty-five participants were randomized, and 29 completed  participation. Systemic exposure to NES and EE released from the CVR increased  with single or multiple doses of miconazole suppositories but not with  multiple-dose cream. The maximum EE geometric mean ratio (GMR) for AUC(8-21d) was  1.67 (1.51-1.86) for single-dose and 1.42 (1.21-1.66) for multiple-dose  suppositories. By contrast, systemic exposure to NES and EE was comparable with  and without miconazole cream (all GMRs and confidence intervals within 0.80 to  1.25). Adverse events (AEs) were similar with CVR only and with all miconazole  treatment groups. There were no serious treatment-related AEs. CONCLUSIONS:  Miconazole vaginal suppositories were associated with increased systemic levels  of NES and EE, while systemic exposure with miconazole vaginal cream was  comparable to no miconazole exposure. IMPLICATIONS: Coadministration of  miconazole suppositories with the investigational NES/EE CVR led to higher  systemic exposure of both hormones, while coadministration with miconazole cream  did not affect hormone levels. Women utilizing the NES/EE CVR may be advised to  use an oral formulation or miconazole cream rather than suppository to treat  vaginal candidiasis.","2018-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:46","","270-276","","3","97","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 69 women (39 receiving pill A and 30  receiving pill B) were evaluated to determine serum ethinyl estradiol, sex  hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and cortisol levels.  Samples were obtained on 1 day during the tenth to twenty-first days of pill  intake. All women received the respective oral contraceptive for at least 3  months. The test power was such that an 80% difference of 1 standard deviation of  each target variable would have been detected (alpha = 0.05; beta = 0.1). No  statistically significant differences were found in sex hormone-binding globulin,  corticosteroid-binding globulin, or cortisol serum levels between both groups.  Time and height of maximum ethinyl estradiol levels were identical as was the  area under the curves. Ex vivo protein-binding analysis of the progestins  revealed a free portion of 0.6% for gestodene and 2.5% for 3-ketodesogestrel as  the active metabolite of desogestrel. Sex hormone-binding globulin-bound portions  were much higher for gestodene (75.3% +/- 9.1%) than for 3-ketodesogestrel (31.6%  +/- 12%). The remaining fractions were bound to albumin. In a second study,  ethinyl estradiol-bioequivalence from pills A and B was investigated in 18 women  in a controlled, single-dose, randomized, crossover design. The area under the  ethinyl estradiol serum levels were identical up to 4 hours after pill intake  between both treatments. According to the relatively low variation in data in  this group of women, a 10% difference in ethinyl estradiol-availability could  have been detected.

The results indicate  that pseudo-first order kinetic estimates of TOrC are not sensitive (p>0.05) to  the initial TOrC concentration as long as the initial TOrC concentration (S0) to  biomass (X0) ratio (on COD basis) is below 2×10(-3). The presence of readily  biodegradable organic matter suppresses TOrC biotransformation rates under  nitrifying and denitrifying conditions, and this impact can be adequately  described using a reversible non-competitive inhibition equation.

Oral  contraceptives containing either progestogen decrease the mean serum  non-protein-bound testosterone concentrations, especially during treatment with  desogestrel (P less than 0.001), and desogestrel may therefore by the more  appropriate progestogen for the treatment of women prone to androgenic side  effects.","1984-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:32","","44-51","","1","42","","Fertil Steril","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6233179","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Biology; Biological Availability; Physiology; Radioimmunoassay; Testosterone/*blood; Serum Albumin/analysis; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/*analysis; Contraception; Family Planning; Levonorgestrel; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacology; *Ethinyl Estradiol--administraction and dosage; *Laboratory Procedures; *Reproductive Control Agents; Contraceptive Agents--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Female--administraction and dosage; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--administraction and dosage; Desogestrel; Endocrine System; Hemic System; *Hormones; *Examinations And Diagnoses; *Diseases; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism/pharmacology; *Levonorgestrel--administraction and dosage; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--administraction and dosage; *Hematological Effects; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/metabolism/*pharmacology; Norgestrel/metabolism/*pharmacology; Norpregnenes/metabolism/*pharmacology; Transcortin/*analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  possibility of such potentiation has been investigated in 37 women using a  combination monophasic oral contraceptive (30 micrograms EE2 and 150 micrograms  levonorgestrel) for two consecutive cycles. Concomitant daily administration of 1  g ascorbic acid taken 1/2 hour before OC intake, was randomly assigned to the  first or second cycle of OC use. On the first and 15th day of OC intake, blood  samples were drawn 11 times over a 12-hour interval and Cmax and AUC(0-12 h)  calculated. On pill days 10 and 21, only 6-hour post-intake samples were  obtained. Samples were analyzed for levels of ascorbic acid, free and sulfated  ethinyl estradiol (and a number of other parameters). Cmax and AUC values for EE2  and EE2-sulfate in cycles with and without ascorbic acid were evaluated  statistically by the Grizzle model for days 1 and 15 and the ratios of day 15/day  1 for each of the substances. No effect of ascorbic acid was observed (alpha =  0.05, 1-beta = 0.9). Only on day 15 was there a significantly lower AUC for  EE2-sulfate in the presence of ascorbic acid intake. Thus, the competition  between ascorbic acid and EE2 for sulfation does not lead to an increased  systemic availability of EE2 and is, therefore, unlikely to be of any clinical  importance. Ascorbic acid can, therefore, be removed from the list of drugs  interfering with the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol.","1993-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:42:22","","377-391","","4","48","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8222665","","","","*Ascorbic Acid--administraction and dosage; *Ascorbic Acid--pharmacodynamics; *Comparative Studies; *Ethinyl Estradiol--analysis; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; *Oral Contraceptives, Combined; Adolescent; Adult; Americas; Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology; Biological Availability; Biology; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--analysis; Contraceptive Methods; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Developed Countries; Ethinyl Estradiol/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Female; Humans; Missouri; North America; Northern America; Oral Contraceptives; Physiology; Research Methodology; Studies; United States; Vitamins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has  been claimed that the progestogenic activity of norgestimate in clinical studies  is almost exclusively based on the parent drug and its major metabolite,  levonorgestrel oxime, and that levonorgestrel does not make an important  contribution. However, to date, no data on the presence of levonorgestrel in the  serum of women who have received oral doses of norgestimate have been presented.  In the present study, 12 young female volunteers received single oral doses of  250 micrograms levonorgestrel in combination with 50 micrograms ethinylestradiol  and 250 micrograms norgestimate in combination with 35 micrograms  ethinylestradiol in an open, randomized, intraindividual comparison. Blood  samples were taken at regular time intervals after each treatment, and the serum  samples were analyzed for their content of levonorgestrel. Basic pharmacokinetic  parameters of levonorgestrel were calculated and from the ratio of the AUC values  obtained after both administrations, the bioavailability of norgestimate-derived  levonorgestrel was calculated. About 22 +/- 6% of the dose of norgestimate  administered became systemically available as levonorgestrel. Thus, it was  concluded that levonorgestrel is a major metabolite of orally administered  norgestimate, and that at least part of the pharmacologic activity of  norgestimate in women is due to the presence of levonorgestrel.","1994-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:10","","255-263","","3","49","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8200219","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Half-Life; Biological Availability; Clinical Research; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; *Ethinyl Estradiol; *Levonorgestrel; *Research Report; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Contraceptive Methods--administraction and dosage; Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Oral Contraceptives--administraction and dosage; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage; *Oral Contraceptives, Combined--administraction and dosage; *Contraception Research; *Human Volunteers--women; *Norgestimate; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women received 1  mg of norethindrone acetate daily combined with 20 microg of ethinyl estradiol  daily for the first 5 days (1/20), 30 microg of ethinyl estradiol daily for the  next 7 days (1/30), and 35 microg of ethinyl estradiol daily for 9 days (1/35).  No medication was given for 7 days in each cycle to allow for withdrawal  bleeding. Serial blood samples for the measurement of ethinyl estradiol and  norethindrone concentrations were collected on days 5, 12, and 21 of the third  treatment cycle for the 1/20, 1/30, and 1/35 dose, respectively. Sex  hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and free testosterone were measured at baseline,  on day 1 of cycles 2 and 3 (SHBG only), and on days 5, 12, and 21 of cycle 3.  Mean steady-state plasma ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone concentrations  increased over cycle 3. The increases in ethinyl estradiol concentrations were  proportional to dose. The increases in norethindrone concentrations were related  to ethinyl estradiol-dependent increases in SHBG concentrations, which were 218%,  253%, and 296% of baseline values on days 5, 12, and 21, respectively. Mean  plasma free testosterone concentrations decreased 47%, 60%, and 64% below  baseline on days 5, 12, and 21 of cycle 3, respectively. Graduated ethinyl  estradiol doses combined with a constant norethindrone acetate dose progressively  increase SHBG and decrease free testosterone, which overrides any theoretic  concerns of androgenic activity of norethindrone acetate. Although true  androgenic activity can be determined only by assessing endpoints such as acne,  hirsutism, and lipids in large controlled trials, the observed changes in  circulating SHBG and free testosterone concentrations indicate that Estrostep has  little, if any, intrinsic androgenic activity.","2001-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:07","","71-76","","2","63","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11292470","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Kinetics; Testosterone/blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/analysis; Norethindrone Acetate; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Androgens/*blood/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Norethindrone/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: This was a  randomized controlled, crossover, equivalency trial. Subjects were randomized to  receive NETA/EE-24 or NETA/EE-21 for 2 months and then switched between study  drugs. Blood and cervical mucus samples were obtained on Days 12-16 and on the  last day of the HFI. RESULTS: From April 2010 to November 2011, 32 subjects were  enrolled with 18 subjects completing all study visits. There were no  statistically significant differences in either day 12-16 (p=.54) or last  hormone-free day (p=.33) cervical mucus NET concentrations between the regimens.  On the last day of the HFI, median serum progesterone levels did not differ  significantly; however, users of NETA/EE-24 had higher levels of serum NET  (p<.001) and users of NETA/EE-21 had higher levels of serum estradiol (p=.01).  CONCLUSION: This data supports the fact that inhibition of the pituitary-ovarian  axis occurs during oral contraceptive use and during the HFI. We demonstrated  that a reduced HFI of 4 days resulted in better suppression of the ovarian  hormone production, thereby reducing the risk of ovulation and potential  contraceptive failure.","2013-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","732-737","","6","87","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this  novel EE-betadex clathrate/drsp preparation, betadex serves as an inert  complexing agent to enhance stability and shelf-life. The study was conducted to  investigate the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters of EE and  drsp after oral administration of EE-betadex clathrate/drsp. METHODS: This was an  open-label, randomized, single-dose, three-period, three-treatment, crossover  study conducted in 18 healthy postmenopausal women aged 45-75 years. The women  received single oral doses of 40 mcg EE/6 mg drsp formulated as EE-betadex  clathrate/drsp or EE/drsp (EE as a free steroid) tablets, or as a  microcrystalline suspension on three separate occasions. Serum samples were  collected for pharmacokinetic analyses. RESULTS: The relative bioavailability of  EE and drsp after EE-betadex clathrate/drsp tablet administration was comparable  with that achieved with the EE/drsp tablet (107% and 101%, respectively). In  addition, the inclusion of EE in a betadex clathrate does not affect the  pharmacokinetics of either EE or drsp. There were no safety concerns with any of  the medications. CONCLUSION: The betadex clathrate formulation of EE, when  combined with DRSP, does not affect the pharmacokinetics and relative  bioavailability of either EE or drsp.","2008-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:25:43","","171-176","","3","77","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18279686","","","","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Biological Availability; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Suspensions/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Tablets/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Androstenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; beta-Cyclodextrins/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Preservatives, Pharmaceutical/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Under double-blind conditions,  13 female healthy volunteers received, in random order and with a washout  interval of > or = 4 weeks, two oral 4-week treatments with vigabatrin (VGB)  (maintenance dosage, 3,000 mg daily) and placebo, respectively. The clearance and  half-life of antipyrine (a broad marker of drug oxidation capacity), the urinary  excretion of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol (a selective marker of cytochrome  CYP3A-mediated oxidation), and the activity of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (a  nonspecific index of microsomal enzyme activity) were determined after 3 weeks of  each treatment. The single-dose kinetics of a combined oral contraceptive  containing 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and 150 micrograms levonorgestrel were  also determined after 3 weeks of treatment by specific radioimmunologic assays.  RESULTS: VGB treatment had no influence on antipyrine clearance (28 +/- 5.6 vs.  30 +/- 4.5 ml/h/kg on placebo), antipyrine half-life (15.5 +/- 3.5 vs. 14.1 +/-  2.1 h), urinary 6-beta-hydroxycortisol excretion (488 +/- 164 vs. 470 +/- 228  nmol/ day), 6-beta-hydroxycortisol-to-cortisol concentration ratio (6.8 +/- 3.1  vs. 6.1 +/- 3.1) and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity (12 +/- 3 vs. 11  +/- 3 IU/L). No difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between VGB and placebo  sessions were found for ethinyl estradiol (half-life, 12.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.9 +/-  3.2 h; AUC, 874 +/- 301 vs. 939 +/- 272 ng/ L/h) and levonorgestrel (half-life,  17.7 +/- 5.2 vs. 23.1 +/- 9.8 h; AUC, 27.5 +/- 9.6 vs. 30.0 +/- 12.0  micrograms/L/h). Two subjects, however, showed a 50 and a 39% reduction in  ethinyl estradiol AUC during VGB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: At therapeutic dosages,  VGB did not modify in vivo indices of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity and did  not interfere significantly with the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of ethinyl  estradiol and levonorgestrel. Based on these data, VGB is unlikely to affect  consistently the efficacy of steroid oral contraceptives or interact  pharmacokinetically with drugs that are eliminated mainly by oxidative pathways,  particularly those involving cytochrome CYP3A.","1997-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:25:09","","702-707","","6","38","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9186253","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Drug Interactions; Half-Life; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Placebos; *Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/*enzymology; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; gamma-Glutamyltransferase/blood; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/drug effects/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/pharmacokinetics; Vigabatrin; Levonorgestrel/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Estradiol Congeners/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/drug effects/metabolism; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Anticonvulsants/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Antipyrine/blood/metabolism; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the extent and the dose dependence of this  conversion in more detail, we performed a study with 24 postmenopausal women who  received single oral doses of 5 mg norethisterone as well as 5 and 10 mg  norethisterone acetate with a washout phase of 2 weeks between each treatment.  After each treatment, blood was collected at regular intervals and the  concentrations of norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol were analyzed in the serum  samples by a specific radioimmunoassay and by gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry, respectively. Ethinyl estradiol was present in the serum samples of  all women following treatment with norethisterone acetate and, except for four  cases, also after treatment with norethisterone. The conversion ratio of  norethisterone acetate to ethinyl estradiol was 0.7 +/- 0.2% and 1.0 +/- 0.4% at  doses of 5 and 10 mg, respectively. This corresponded to an oral dose equivalent  of about 6 micrograms ethinyl estradiol per milligram of norethisterone acetate.  For norethisterone, a conversion ratio of 0.4 +/- 0.4% was found at a dose of 5  mg, which corresponded to an oral dose equivalent of about 4 micrograms ethinyl  estradiol per milligram of norethisterone. Although it cannot be excluded that in  individual cases, even higher doses of ethinyl estradiol may be produced by  conversion, it is concluded that at therapeutic doses of the progestogens, the  exposure to metabolically derived ethinyl estradiol is probably of little  clinical significance not only in fertile women using oral contraceptive  combination preparations containing norethisterone and ethinyl estradiol, but  also in postmenopausal women who receive oral doses of estradiol for estrogen  replacement. The estrogenic effects of metabolically derived ethinyl estradiol on  the liver (eg. synthesis of transport proteins) are very likely more than  compensated due to the androgenic activity of norethisterone.","1997-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","379-385","","6","56","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9494772","","","","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Cohort Studies; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Biological Availability; Postmenopause/*metabolism; Norethindrone Acetate; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Progesterone Congeners/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*blood; Estradiol Congeners/*blood; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little  or no inactivation was observed when P450s 2B2 or 2B4 were incubated with 17EE.  The inactivation of P450s 2B1 and 2B6 was entirely dependent on both NADPH and  17EE and followed pseudo-first order kinetics. The maximal rate constants for the  inactivation of P450s 2B1 and 2B6 at 30 degrees C were 0.2 and 0.03 min(-1),  respectively. For P450s 2B1 and 2B6 the apparent K(I) was 11 and 0.8 microM,  respectively. Incubation of P450 2B1 with 17EE and NADPH for 20 min resulted in a  75% loss in enzymatic activity and a concurrent 20 to 25% loss of the enzyme's  ability to form a reduced CO complex. With P450 2B6, an 83% loss in enzymatic  activity and a 5 to 10% loss in the CO reduced spectrum were observed. The  extrapolated partition ratios for 17EE with P450 2B1 and 2B6 were 21 and 13,  respectively. Simultaneous incubation of an alternate substrate together with  17EE protected both enzymes from inactivation. A 1.3:1 stoichiometry of labeling  for binding of the radiolabeled 17EE to P450 2B1 and 2B6 was seen. These results  indicate that 17EE inactivates P450s 2B1 and 2B6 in a mechanism-based manner,  primarily by the binding of a reactive intermediate of 17EE to the apoprotein.  Analysis of the 17EE metabolites showed that 2B enzymes that become inactivated  differ primarily by their ability to generate two metabolites that were not  produced by P450s 2B2 or 2B4.","2002-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","549-558","","2","300","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11805216","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Substrate Specificity; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Biotransformation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; *Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; *Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; Liver/drug effects/enzymology; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6; Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Phenobarbital/pharmacology; Rats, Long-Evans; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesis/chemistry; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/isolation & purification/metabolism; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry; Steroid Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study determined whether application of the AP to three  different anatomical sites (lower abdomen, buttock and upper torso) influences  the pharmacokinetic profile of EE and levonorgestrel (LNG). STUDY DESIGN: In this  open-label, three-period, crossover study, 24 subjects were randomized to one of  six treatment sequences; each included application of patch to abdomen, buttock  and upper torso, with the AP worn on one site for 7 days. After a 7-day washout,  a new patch was applied to the next anatomical site. Multiple blood samples were  collected up to 240 h after patch application. RESULTS: For plasma EE levels,  median time to maximum drug concentration (Tmax, 24-48 h) and mean maximum  concentration (Cmax, 47.9-61.5 pg/mL) were similar among application sites.  Compared with lower abdomen, EE exposure was higher (16%-30%) at buttock and  upper torso (15%-22%).

OBJECTIVE: The aim  of this study was to evaluate the effect of solifenacin on the pharmacokinetic  (PK) parameters of an oral contraceptive (OC) containing ethinyl estradiol (EE)  and levonorgestrel (LNG). METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled,  2-period, crossover study, 24 healthy, young, white women received a combined OC  (EE 30 microg + LNG 150 microg) daily for two 21-day cycles, separated by a 7-day  washout. On day 12 of each cycle, subjects began a 10-day regimen of solifenacin  10 mg QD, which is 2 times the suggested starting dose, or placebo. Subjects  crossed over to the other treatment arm for the second cycle. Primary PK end  points were C(max) and AUC from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24 h)) for EE and LNG.  Women ranged in age from 20 to 37 years and had a mean body weight of 64 kg, mean  height of 167.4 cm, and mean body mass index of 23 kg/m2. Seven women had never  smoked, while 5 were former smokers and 12 were regular smokers. Safety  assessments included the nature, frequency, and severity of spontaneously  reported or observed adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, laboratory  values, and physical examination. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of AUC(0-24  h)/product of baseline concentration and total blood sampling time, and  C(max)/baseline concentration ratios of solifenacin versus placebo for EE and LNG  found the 90% CI to be within the predefined range of 0.8 to 1.25 (EE:  0.854-1.164 and 0.822-1.167; LNG: 0.920-1.125 and 0.910-1.139). The number of  samples with non-quantifiable luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating  hormone (FSH) levels were comparable after administration of the OC with either  solifenacin or placebo. The adverse event most frequently reported was dry mouth  (solifenacin, n = 25 [9 mild, 13 moderate, and 3 severe] vs placebo, n = 1  [moderate]). There were no clinically relevant effects on vital signs,  electrocardiogram, or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: A PK interaction  between solifenacin and the OC containing EE and LNG was not found in this study.  Solifenacin was not found to have altered suppression of LH or FSH. The drug was  well tolerated in these healthy, young, white, adult female volunteers.","2005-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:40:21","","1403-1410","","9","27","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16291413","","","","Adult; Area Under Curve; Contraceptives, Oral/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Female; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Humans; Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Luteinizing Hormone/blood; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Middle Aged; Muscarinic Antagonists/*administration & dosage; Quinuclidines/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Solifenacin Succinate; Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; White People","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Progesterone and sex hormone binding globulin  (SHBG) levels were also measured. Troglitazone decreased EE Cmax and AUC(0-24) by  32% and 29%, respectively. Likewise, troglitazone decreased NE Cmax and AUC(0-24)  by 31% and 30%, respectively. Plasma SHBG concentrations increased from 113  nmol/L during cycle 2 to 220 nmol/L during cycle 3. Troglitazone reduced plasma  unbound AUC for NE by 49%. Serum progesterone levels were lower than 1.5 ng/mL on  all occasions. Thus, coadministration of troglitazone and Ortho-Novum decreases  the systemic exposure to EE and NE.

Twice the standard dose of the Yuzpe regimen (200 microg  of ethinyl estradiol, 1000 microg of levonorgestrel) or the levonorgestrel  regimen (1500 microg of levonorgestrel) was self-administered vaginally. One week  later, each subject received orally the standard dose of the assigned medication.  Serial blood samples were collected over 24 h and assayed for levonorgestrel and  ethinyl estradiol (for the Yuzpe regimen only). Paired t tests were used to  compare oral vs. vaginal administration for maximum concentration (Cmax), time to  maximum concentration (Tmax) and area under the curve over 24 h (AUC0-24).  Relative bioavailability (vaginal/oral) was derived from AUC0-24. Vaginal  administration of double the standard dose of the Yuzpe regimen resulted in a  lower Cmax (vaginal=5.4 vs. oral=14.6 ng/mL, p=.038) and a later Tmax (5.9 vs.  2.0 h, p=.066) for levonorgestrel, compared to oral administration. Corresponding  ethinyl estradiol concentrations were higher (786 vs. 391 pg/mL, p=.039) and  peaked later (4.0 vs. 1.9 hr, p=.154) with vaginal administration. Relative  bioavailabilities for levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol were 58% and 175%,  respectively. Similarly, vaginal administration of the levonorgestrel regimen  resulted in a lower Cmax (vaginal=5.4 vs. oral=15.2 ng/mL, p=.006) and a later  Tmax (7.4 vs. 1.3 h, p=.037) for levonorgestel, compared to oral administration.  The relative bioavailability was 62%.

STUDY  DESIGN: We used pharmacokinetic (PK) data (n = 37) from a multicenter,  open-label, nonrandomized study of healthy women (18-38 years) that used the CVS  for 13 cycles in a 21 days-in/7 days-out regimen to develop a linear regression  model to predict daily serum SA and EE levels for 364 days of continuous CVS use.  We then determined residual SA/EE levels in vitro from 18 randomly chosen CVS  used by women who completed 13 cycles. Serum SA and EE levels were also predicted  for 364 days of continuous CVS use in another in vitro study. RESULTS: After a  hypothetical 364 days of continuous CVS use, we predicted daily mean serum levels  to be 184 pmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 102‒332 pmol/L) for SA and 43  pmol/L (95% CI, 19‒95 pmol/L) for EE. We did predict that serum EE levels would  not accumulate over time. Residual SA and EE in the CVS were 60% and 80% of the  original load after 13 cycles, respectively. CONCLUSION: The predicted serum SA  level after 364 days of hypothetical continuous CVS use was comparable to  reported levels at which no pregnancy occurred (>100 pmol/L), showing the  potential of the CVS for one year of continuous use. Clinical trials on  continuous CVS use are planned. IMPLICATIONS: Based on statistical modeling, the  long-term, user-controlled contraceptive vaginal system containing segesterone  acetate and ethinyl estradiol may have the potential to provide effective  pregnancy prevention if used continuously (without removal) for one year. Further  investigation is warranted.","2021-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:35:20","","229-234","","3","104","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

We determined  whether rifalazil influences CYP3A4 metabolism by studying the effect of a single  oral, 25 mg dose of rifalazil administered to healthy postmenopausal women, on  the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of ethinyl estradiol (EE) during  administration of Ortho-Novum 1/35 (EE/NET). Noncompartmental PK and sequential  statistical analyses were performed to establish if and when subjects achieved  steady-state EE plasma concentrations and to determine whether this steady state  was altered by rifalazil administration. The geometric mean ratios for the  difference between EE alone and following rifalazil for EE Cmax, AUC(0-24) and  Cmin were 105.9, 104.4 and 105.0, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals for  each ratio fell within 80 - 125% of the reference treatment indicating no  significant difference in the PK of EE before or after rifalazil administration.  The posterior probabilities for the true treatment differences of Cmax or  AUC(0-24) being less than 20% were > 99.99% in both cases. Based on the results  of this study, there is no CYP3A4-metabolic interaction between a single oral, 25  mg dose of rifalazil and EE for either induction or inhibition. Consequently,  there is minimal threat of contraceptive failure when single doses of rifalazil  are administered with EE/NET. A single dose of rifalazil 25 mg was well tolerated  when administered concomitantly with a combination oral contraceptive (EE/NET) by  healthy postmenopausal females.","2007-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:49","","418-422","","7","45","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 17725249","","","","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage; Postmenopause; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Estrogens/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Rifamycins/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated the relative  bioavailability of EE and GSD after application of this patch to three different  sites. METHODS: In this phase I, open-label, randomized, intra-individual  comparison, crossover study, 43 women (aged 18 - 45 years) were randomized to one  of six treatment sequences. Patches were applied to two test sites (buttocks and  outer, upper arm) and one comparator site (lower abdomen). In each treatment  period, four patches were worn for 7 days each, followed by a 7-day, patch-free  interval. The primary objective was to investigate the relative bioavailability  of transdermally administered EE and GSD between test and comparator sites using  the primary variable area under the concentration- time curve (AUC(0-168)) during  week 4 of each period. RESULTS: Of the 43 women who were randomized, 43 were  included in the set for safety evaluation and 40 were included in the set for  pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. Three subjects were excluded from the PK analysis  as they failed to complete the study. AUC(0-168) for EE and GSD were equal when  the patch was applied to buttocks or abdomen (AUC(0-168) ratios: EE, 1.07 (94%  confidence interval, CI: 0.994 - 1.16); GSD, 1.02 (94% CI: 0.946 - 1.10)).  Relative bioavailabilities for EE and GSD were 31% and 24% higher, respectively,  for arm vs. abdomen. AUC(0-168) 94% CI for the arm/abdomen ratio exceeded the  pre-defined bioequivalence range of 80 - 125% (EE: 1.21 - 1.42; GSD: 1.15 -  1.34). Other PK parameters were correspondingly higher for arm vs. buttocks or  abdomen. Patch adhesion and tolerability were good, with no relevant differences  between sites.

Plasma concentrations of cortisol and ethinyl estradiol (INN, ethinylestradiol)  were also compared. METHODS: Forty healthy women took part in this single-blind,  randomized placebo-controlled study with two parallel groups, where a three-way  crossover design was applied within groups. One group was taking an oral  contraceptive (150 microg desogestrel and 30 microg ethinyl estradiol); the other  group (control) was not. On seven consecutive mornings, oral doses of 4.5 mg  budesonide, 20 mg prednisolone, or placebo were administered. There was a washout  period of at least one menstrual cycle between administration periods. RESULTS:  In the oral contraceptive users, the average plasma concentration of prednisolone  was 131% higher than in the control group (P < .001), whereas the average plasma  concentration of budesonide was only 22% higher (not significant). Mean plasma  cortisol levels were suppressed by 90% and 82% with prednisolone and by 22% and  28% with budesonide in oral contraceptive users and the control subjects,  respectively. The group difference was significant with prednisolone (P < .001)  but not with budesonide. Ethinyl estradiol levels in plasma were not affected by  administration of either glucocorticosteroid. CONCLUSION: No difference was found  in plasma levels of budesonide or in cortisol suppression after administration of  budesonide capsules in women taking the oral contraceptive and those who were  not. The oral contraceptive users had much higher plasma levels of prednisolone  and greater cortisol suppression.

The scanning electron microscopy, light-scattering analyzer and gel permeation  chromatography were used to study the morphology, particle size and molecular  weight of the polymer microspheres, respectively. HPLC was utilized to determine  the drug loading and the drug released, while a LC-MS-MS system was employed to  analyze the plasma drug concentration. Result indicated that the PLGA particles  obtained were spherical and appropriate in size. The formulation was stable  during the test period. In vitro drug release from the microspheres for both  drugs was sustained for about 30 days mostly by the diffusion mechanism. The  plasma drug concentration-time profiles of the drug-loaded microspheres were  relatively smooth after subcutaneous injection to rats for about 1-month,  compared with that for drug suspension. In vitro and in vivo correlation was  established. One of the most important facts is the synchronicity of the two  contraceptives both in the release kinetics in vitro and the pharmacokinetic  behaviors in vivo. Therefore, the synchronic delivery of two contraceptives is  achieved for about 1 month by using the injectable PLGA-based microspheres.","2008-08-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:40:19","","192-199","","3","129","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 18539353","","","","Animals; Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium/chemistry; Contraceptive Agents, Female/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Carriers/chemistry; Estrogens/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Feasibility Studies; Female; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; In Vitro Techniques; Lactic Acid/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Microspheres; Molecular Weight; Norpregnenes/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Polyglycolic Acid/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer; Polysorbates/chemistry; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Ten subjects  regularly taking Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 (Ortho Pharmaceutical, Raritan, N.J.) and 10  subjects regularly taking Triphasil (Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Philadelphia),  which contain ethinyl estradiol 35 microg and 30 microg during days 1 to 6,  respectively, were randomly assigned to receive a single 150 mg dose of  fluconazole 2 hours before the oral contraceptive, on pill day 6 of one of two  menstrual cycles. Ethinyl estradiol serum concentrations were measured at  baseline and up to 24 hours after oral contraceptive intake. No fluconazole was  administered during the other menstrual cycle, which served as the control.  RESULTS: Mean serum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol were increased after  fluconazole administration in both oral contraceptive groups. Maximum observed  serum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve values were  significantly (p < 0.05) greater during the fluconazole regimens (vs regimens  without fluconazole) for both oral contraceptive groups and for combined values  of the two oral contraceptive groups.

METHODS: A placebo-controlled,  double-masked, randomized, two-way crossover study was used to investigate the  pharmacokinetic interaction between 300 mg fluconazole once weekly and the OC  Ortho Novum 7/7/7 (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc., Raritan, NJ) in 26 healthy  women, 18-36 years old. In the first cycle (28 days), subjects received OC only.  In the second cycle, subjects were assigned randomly to receive OC-fluconazole or  OC-placebo. In the third cycle, subjects were crossed over to the opposite  treatment. RESULTS: Data for 21 subjects who completed the study were included in  the pharmacokinetic analysis; data for all 26 subjects were included in the  safety analysis (26 OC only; 24 OC-fluconazole; 23 OC-placebo). Treatment with  OC-fluconazole resulted in small but statistically significant increases in 0-24  hour area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) for both ethinyl  estradiol (mean 24%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 18%, 31%) and norethindrone  (mean 13%, 95% CI 8%, 18%) as compared with treatment with OC-placebo. Ethinyl  estradiol maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) was slightly (mean 8%, 95% CI 2%,  15%) though statistically significantly higher for OC-fluconazole treatment as  compared with OC-placebo treatment. Norethindrone C(max) was not different (95%  CI -6%, 11%) between the two treatment groups. No adverse events related to  treatment were seen in the fluconazole treatment group. CONCLUSION: The  concomitant administration of 300 mg fluconazole once weekly, twice the  recommended dose for vaginal candidiasis, to women using OCs results in a slight  increase in OC concentrations. Therefore, it appears that there is no threat of  contraceptive failure because of concomitant fluconazole administration.","2001-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:50","","218-223","","2","98","","Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11506836","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Drug Interactions; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Combinations; Antifungal Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; Mestranol/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacokinetics; Fluconazole/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  This was a 3-way crossover study with 12 healthy female volunteers. The first  phase was a control phase, in which all subjects received a single 150-mg dose of  bupropion (sustained release) without pretreatment. In the second and third  phases, in randomized balanced crossover order, subjects received a 10-day  pretreatment with either hormone replacement therapy, containing 2 mg estradiol  valerate and 250 microg levonorgestrel, or an oral contraceptive, containing 30  microg ethinyl estradiol (INN, ethinylestradiol) and 150 microg desogestrel, and  the bupropion dose was given 1 hour after the last hormone dose. The bupropion,  hydroxybupropion, and hydrobupropion plasma concentrations were determined for up  to 72 hours. RESULTS: The 10-day hormone replacement therapy pretreatment reduced  the hydroxybupropion/bupropion area under the plasma concentration-time curve  (AUC) ratio by 49% (P <.001; 95% confidence interval [CI], -58% to -40%) as a  result of a marked 47% decrease (P <.001; 95% CI, -54% to -41%) in the AUC of  hydroxybupropion. Moreover, the AUC of hydrobupropion was significantly (64%; P  =.003; 95% CI, 22% to 106%) increased. The AUC of hydroxybupropion was also  reduced after the oral contraceptive treatment but to a lesser extent (-31%; P  <.001; 95% CI, -37% to -26%). However, the hydroxybupropion/bupropion AUC ratio  was not significantly affected. CONCLUSIONS: Hormone replacement therapy markedly  inhibited the CYP2B6-catalyzed hydroxylation of bupropion, whereas a combination  oral contraceptive had only a modest effect on CYP2B6 activity. Patients  receiving hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives may need dose  adjustment when treated with drugs metabolized by CYP2B6.","2003-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:31","","326-333","","4","74","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14534519","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Cross-Over Studies; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6; Hydroxylation/drug effects; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Levonorgestrel/pharmacology; Desogestrel/pharmacology; *Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; *Hormone Replacement Therapy; *Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Bupropion/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have  examined whether contaminants remain adsorbed following ingestion by aquatic  organisms. The objective of this study was to examine the bioavailability and  bioactivity of ethinyl estradiol (EE2) sorbed onto SWCNTs in a fish  gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Sorption experiments indicated that SWCNTs  effectively adsorbed EE2, but the chemical was still able to bind and activate  soluble estrogen receptors (ERs) in vitro. However, centrifugation to remove  SWCNTs and adsorbed EE2 significantly reduced ER activity compared to that of EE2  alone. Additionally, the presence of SWCNTs did not reduce the extent of  EE2-driven induction of vitellogenin 1 in vivo compared to the levels in  organisms exposed to EE2 alone. These results suggest that while SWCNTs adsorb  EE2 from aqueous solutions, under biological conditions EE2 can desorb and retain  bioactivity. Additional results indicate that interactions with gastrointestinal  proteins may decrease the level of adsorption of estrogen to SWCNTs by 5%. This  study presents valuable data for elucidating how SWCNTs interact with chemicals  that are already present in our aquatic environments, which is essential for  determining their potential health risk.","2017-01-17","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","948-957","","2","51","","Environ Sci Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27977933","","","","Animals; Biological Availability; Estradiol; Estrogens; Gastrointestinal Absorption; Gastrointestinal Tract/*metabolism; *Nanotubes, Carbon; Ethinyl Estradiol/*metabolism/toxicity; Fishes/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: Intermenstrual bleeding rates were higher for  OC3 when compared with OC1 (p = 0.01). The number of intermenstrual bleeding days  was highest for OC3 (p = 0.001) and higher for OC2 when compared with OC1 (p <  0.006). The onset of withdrawal bleeding occurred faster in OC3 patients (p <  0.02).

DESIGN: Seven healthy young women were investigated by using the euglycemic  hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique (insulin delivery rate = 100 mU/kg per  hour for 120 minutes). This test was performed, after an overnight fast, during  the last 7 days of a spontaneous cycle and within the last 5 days of pill intake  during the sixth and twelfth cycle of a continuous treatment with Diane-35 in  each subject. RESULTS: The three indexes measuring the insulin-induced glucose  disposal during the clamp (glucose infusion rate, glucose metabolic clearance  rate, and glucose infusion rate divided by plasma insulin plateau levels) were  not significantly affected by Diane-35. In contrast, the metabolic clearance rate  of the exogenous insulin infused during the clamp tended to be slightly increased  with Diane-35 (significant after 6 but not after 12 cycles). CONCLUSION: These  results suggest that a 1-year treatment with the OC Diane-35, which contains EE2  + a 17-OHP rather than a 19-nortestosterone derivative as the progestogen  compound, does not significantly alter peripheral (presumably muscular) insulin  sensitivity but slightly increases insulin (presumably hepatic) clearance.","1993-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","797-802","","4","59","","Fertil Steril","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8458499","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Biology; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Drug Combinations; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Oral Contraceptives; Physiology; Research Methodology; Studies; Glucose/*metabolism; Insulin/*metabolism/pharmacology; C-Peptide/analysis; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacology; *Oral Contraceptives, Low-dose; *Research Report; *Oral Contraceptives, Combined; *Metabolic Effects; *Glucose Metabolism Effects; Carbohydrate Metabolic Effects; *Prospective Studies; Cyproterone Acetate/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inactivation is dependent  on NADPH, and it is irreversible. The inactivation of 3A5 by EE is also dependent  on cytochrome b5 (b5). The values for the K(I) and k(inact) of the  7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin O-debenzylation activity of 3A5 are 26  microM and 0.06 min(-1), respectively. Incubation of 3A5 with EE resulted in a  62% loss of catalytic activity, 60% loss in the reduced CO difference spectrum,  and 40% decrease in native heme with the formation of a heme adduct. The  partition ratio was approximately 25, and the stoichiometry of binding was  approximately 0.3 mol of EE metabolite bound/mol of P450 inactivated. Four major  metabolites were formed during the metabolism of EE by 3A5. SDS-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that [3H]EE was irreversibly bound to  3A5 apoprotein. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis  (LC-MS/MS) revealed that two glutathione (GSH) conjugates with m/z values of 620  were formed only in the presence of b5. These two conjugates are formed from the  reaction of GSH with the ethynyl group with the oxygen being inserted into either  the internal or terminal carbon. A heme adduct with the ion at m/z 927 and two  dipyrrole adducts with ions at m/z 579 were detected by LC-MS/MS analysis. In  conclusion, 3A5 can activate EE to a 17alpha-oxirene-related reactive species  that can then partition the oxygen between the internal and terminal carbons of  the ethynyl group to form heme and apoprotein adducts, resulting in the  inactivation of P450 3A5.","2007-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","276-287","","1","321","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17251390","","","","Humans; Biotransformation; Chromatography, Liquid; Mass Spectrometry; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chemistry, Physical; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; *Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Chemical Phenomena; Heme/*metabolism; Glutathione/*metabolism; NADP/metabolism; Apoproteins/*metabolism; Cytochromes b5/*physiology; Endopeptidases/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In this nonblinded study, 20  healthy women using Ortho Novum 7/7/7-28 were selected for a three-OC-cycle  study. Baseline measures included E2 and progesterone serum levels on days 21,  23, 25, and 27 of cycle one and days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of cycle two. During cycle  two, 24-hour blood sampling and radioimmunoassay analysis for ethinyl E2  pharmacokinetics were performed on day 8 and pelvic ultrasound on day 13. Oral  dirithromycin 500 mg/day for 14 days began on day 21 of cycle 2. After starting  dirithromycin, cycle two and three serum E2, progesterone, and serial ethinyl E2  levels and pelvic ultrasound replicated the baseline schedule. Ovulation was  assumed if E2 concentration was greater than 50 pg/mL, progesterone concentration  was greater than 3 ng/mL, or if an ovarian cyst greater than 10 mm was present on  ultrasound. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated a small (7.6%) but  statistically significant decrease (P = .03) in the mean ethinyl E2 24-hour area  under the curve and an increase in apparent oral clearance. No woman ovulated,  based on E2 levels and progesterone concentrations or ultrasound. CONCLUSION:  Dirithromycin increased the apparent oral clearance of ethinyl E2. The clinical  importance of the interaction may be negligible because no woman ovulated or had  compromised OC effectiveness in this small series.","1995-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:41:29","","78-84","","1","86","","Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7784027","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic; Drug Combinations; Erythromycin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Female; Humans; Macrolides; Mestranol; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Norethindrone; Ovulation/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  the potential for estrogenic contaminants to induce these effects in fish has not  yet been examined. The ability of the estrogen analog ethynylestradiol (EE2) to  alter concentrations of the lipid-soluble vitamins A and E in plasma, liver, and  kidney was investigated in juvenile lake sturgeon (430 +/- 20 g). The EE2 was  delivered to the sturgeon in the tank water at nominal concentrations of 0  (control), 15, 60, or 125 ng EE2/L for a period of 25 d. Concentrations of the  egg yolk precursor, vitellogenin, increased dose dependently in plasma. Plasma  vitamin E (tocopherol), A1 (retinol), and A2 (dehydroretinol) were elevated by  the two highest EE2 treatments compared with the controls. Esterified storage  forms of vitamin A were marginally lower in the livers of fish from the highest  EE2 dose group, but vitamin E levels in the liver were not significantly  affected. Concentrations of vitamin E and vitamin A were significantly depleted  in the kidney of fish from the two highest EE2 dose groups. Total lipid content  was elevated in the gonad of fish treated with the highest dose of EE2 compared  with the controls.

Twenty premenopausal women studied in  the early and late follicular phases of the menstrual cycle were presumed to  reflect normal physiologic function. Variable responses of the different  biochemical and biologic markers to the actions of ethinyl estradiol were  observed. Liver protein synthesis was the most sensitive measure of the action of  ethinyl estradiol. In comparing the relative potencies of ethinyl estradiol with  previously reported results observed with the usage of conjugated equine  estrogens, the actions of 10 micrograms ethinyl estradiol were approximately  equivalent to the biologic effects of 1.25 mg conjugated estrogens. The results  suggest that ethinyl estradiol is far more potent than previously believed and  that the daily administration of 10 micrograms, a dose lower than currently  available commercial preparations, may be adequate for relief of symptoms of  vaginal atrophy and may provide protection from the occurrence of osteoporotic  fractures.","1982-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","673-679","","6","59","","Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6281707","","","","Humans; Female; Administration, Oral; Biological Availability; Liver/drug effects; Fractures, Bone/prevention & control; Protein Biosynthesis; *Menopause; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage; Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)/administration & dosage; Follicular Phase/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The metabolism of 2,4-dibromoethynyloestradiol (2,4-DBEE2) in the rat was studied in order to determine the influence of ring-A substituents on the phase I  biotransformations of oestrogens. 2. 2,4-Dibromo-17  alpha-ethynyl[6,7-3H]oestradiol was synthesized by the one-stage bromination of  17 alpha-ethynyl[6,7-3H]oestradiol (EE2) with N-bromoacetamide, and administered  (30 micrograms/kg, i.v.) to anaesthetized male and female rats. 3. A single  metabolite, identified as a glucuronide of 2,4-DBEE2, was rapidly and extensively  eliminated in bile by male rats (83% of the dose over 6 h). Females excreted  additional minor conjugated metabolites. Neither unchanged 2,4-DBEE2 nor EE2 was  detected in bile. 4. The hepatic residues after 6 h (percentage of dose) were  2.7% and 3.4% in male and female rats, respectively, whilst less than 0.1% per  organ(s) was found in kidneys, heart, spleen, lungs and brain. 5. 2,4-Dibromo  substitution of EE2 effectively blocked all phase I biotransformations whilst not  limiting glucuronylation in male rats, but did not entirely preclude phase I  metabolism in females. The inertness of 2,4-DBEE2 to ring-A hydroxylation in male  rats conforms with the insignificant debromination of 2,4-dibromoestradiol by  hepatic microsomes.","1990-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","45-54","","1","20","","Xenobiotica","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2327107","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Hydrolysis; Bile/*metabolism; Chemistry; Chemical Phenomena; Xenobiotics; Estradiol/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives; Ethylene Dibromide/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence of carcinogenicity in rodents  has been reported for each of these compounds, but so far only few studies have  been carried out in vitro. Because it has been shown that isolated liver cells in  suspension are able efficiently to metabolize steroid hormones, we have tested  these chemicals in V79 cells with a cell-mediated system using primary  hepatocytes from male and female rats as the metabolic layer. The incubation in  the presence of the chemical to be tested was carried out at concentrations  ranging from 25 to 100 microM, for 48 h before plating the V79 cells to score for  mutagenicity or toxicity. In the absence of hepatocytes, the 4 estrogenic  hormones were very toxic, but not mutagenic. The co-cultivation of V79 cells with  primary hepatocytes decreased the toxic effect induced by the sex hormones,  except in the case of ethynylestradiol. However, no mutation, determined as  8-azaguanine- or ouabain-resistance, was induced under these conditions by any of  the hormones tested. The lack of mutagenic activity of these hormones in our  assay had been confirmed by the use of primary liver cells that originated from a  rat treated with Aroclor, an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes.","1981-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","83-90","","1","89","","Mutat Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 7242549","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Biotransformation; Drug Resistance; Cell Survival/drug effects; Cricetinae; Cell Adhesion/drug effects; Estrogens/*pharmacology; *Mutagens; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacology; Estradiol/pharmacology; Diethylstilbestrol/pharmacology; Estrone/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to this,  the noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) content of rat brain  regions was assayed after three months of hormone treatment. The onset of the  brain amine depletion was observed by the end of the second month of hormone  administration. The amine(s) depleting action was found to be due to the  norgestrel component of the pill. Studies of the regional distribution of  amine(s) showed that the depletion was more prominent in the hypothalamus and  pons/medulla oblongata. The assay of the monoamine oxidase enzyme did not reveal  any significant change, though the estrogenic and progestogenic hormones were  found to have opposing effects on the enzyme levels.","1980-03-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","821-825","","5","29","","Biochem Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20227962","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Tissue Distribution; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Norgestrel/*pharmacology; Biogenic Amines/analysis/*metabolism; Brain/enzymology/*metabolism; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/pharmacology; Monoamine Oxidase/analysis/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  study investigated the effect of liraglutide on the pharmacokinetics of the  components of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel).  Postmeno-pausal healthy women (n = 21) were included. A single dose of this  contraceptive was administered.

The 90% confidence  interval (CI) of the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) (1.06; 90% CI,  0.99-1.13) for ethinyl estradiol (during liraglutide and placebo) was within  defined limits, demonstrating equivalence. The 90% CI for the ratio of AUC for  levonorgestrel was not fully contained within the limits (1.18; 90% CI,  1.04-1.34) (levonorgestrel AUC was 18% greater with liraglutide vs placebo).  However, equivalence was demonstrated for levonorgestrel AUC(0-t) (1.15; 90% CI,  1.06-1.24).

For each batch experiment, two reactors were set up--aerobic  and alternating anoxic/aerobic-which were then amended with E2 and EE2 from  methanolic stock solutions. The EE2 was persistent under anoxic conditions; under  aerobic conditions, the observed level of its removal was 22%. The E2 was readily  converted to estrone (El)--faster under aerobic (nitrifying) than anoxic  (denitrifying) conditions. During the initial anoxic conditions, a metabolite  consistent with 17-alpha-estradiol transiently accumulated and was subsequently  removed when the reactor was aerated. Higher removal rates of estrogens were  associated with higher nitrification rates, which supports the contention that  the nitrifying biomass was responsible for their removal.","2008-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","47-52","","1","80","","Water Environ Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18254398","","","","Biotransformation; Aerobiosis; Sewage/*chemistry; Nitrogen/metabolism; Anaerobiosis; Estradiol/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism; Waste Disposal, Fluid/*methods; Estrone/metabolism; Estrogens/isolation & purification/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  cell association of native human LDL, Me-LDL and CHD-LDL to parenchymal and  non-parenchymal cells was determined in vivo by isolating the various cell types  30 min after intravenous injection of the lipoproteins. In order to prevent  degradation or release of cell-bound apolipoproteins during cell dissociation and  purification, a low-temperature (8 degrees C) liver perfusion and cell isolation  procedure was performed. It was found that reductive methylation of LDL inhibits  the association of LDL to both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, indicating  that lysine residues are important for recognition of LDL by both these cell  types. In contrast, cyclohexanedione treatment of LDL did not influence the cell  association of LDL to non-parenchymal cells. 17 alpha-Ethinyl estradiol treatment  selectively increases the cell association of LDL by parenchymal cells (16-fold),  leaving the non-parenchymal cell association uninfluenced. The increased  cell-association of LDL to parenchymal cells is almost completely blocked by  cyclohexanedione treatment of LDL (by 81%) or by methylation of LDL (by 97%).  These data indicate that the arginine residues in LDL are not important for the  recognition of LDL by non-parenchymal cells, whereas for the cell association of  LDL to the estrogen-stimulated binding site on parenchymal cells both arginine  and lysine residues are essential. The in vivo cell association of CHD-LDL or  native LDL to non-parenchymal cells was lowered to the level of Me-LDL by ethyl  oleate treatment of the rats, while no effect of ethyl oleate on parenchymal  cells was noticed. These data suggest that the specific site for LDL on  non-parenchymal cells, which need lysine residues on LDL for recognition, can be  down-regulated by ethyl oleate treatment. The LDL, internalized by  non-parenchymal cells, is effectively degraded. This degradation occurs at least  partly in the lysosomes. It is suggested that the unique recognition site for LDL  on non-parenchymal cells may be quantitatively important for serum LDL  catabolism.","1984-07-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","340-347","","2","794","","Biochim Biophys Acta","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 6329312","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Perfusion; Receptors, LDL; Tissue Distribution; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Liver/*metabolism; Methylation; Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism; Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism; Cyclohexanones/pharmacology; Oleic Acids/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goal was to  evaluate the association of a model contaminant [17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2)] with  nC(60) and determine bioavailability of EE2 after accumulation by a filter  feeding organism [Brine shrimp (BS) Artemia sp.] and subsequent dietary exposure  in zebrafish.

Accumulation of nC(60) in gut of BS was assessed by light  microscopy, and C(60) were extracted from BS and concentration analyzed by HPLC.  Adult male zebrafish were fed (5d) live BS according to the following treatments:  BS (control); BS containing nC(60); BS containing nC(60)+EE2; or BS containing  EE2. Liver was excised from exposed fish and total RNA was extracted for  assessment of vitellogenin gene (vtg1A/B) expression. The vtg1A/B was highly  up-regulated in fish exposed to BS containing EE2, but expression of vtg1A/B did  not differ from controls in other treatments. The EE2 associated with nC(60) did  not become bioavailable in zebrafish during passage through the intestinal tract  of zebrafish.

Aiming  to evaluate the effects of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 on the catabolism of these  microemulsions, LDE with incorporated apo B-100 (LDE-apoB) and native LDL, all  labeled with radioactive lipids were studied after intraarterial injection into  Wistar rats. Plasma decay curves of the labels were determined in samples  collected over 10 h and tissue uptake was assayed from organs excised from the  animals sacrificed 24 h after injection. LDE-apo B had a fractional clearance  rate (FCR) similar to native LDL (0.40 and 0.33, respectively) but both had FCR  pronouncedly smaller than LDE (0.56, P<0.01). Liver was the main uptake site for  LDE, LDE-apoB, and native LDL, but LDE-apoB and native LDL had lower hepatic  uptake rates than LDE. Pre-treatment of the rats with 17alpha-ethinylestradiol,  known to upregulate LDLR, accelerated the removal from plasma of both LDE and  LDE-apoB, but the effect was greater upon LDE than LDE-apoB. These differences in  metabolic behavior documented in vivo can be interpreted by the lower affinity of  LDLR for apo B-100 than for apo E, demonstrated in in vitro studies. Therefore,  our study shows in vivo that, in comparison with apo E, apo B is a less efficient  ligand to remove lipid particles such as microemulsions or lipoproteins from the  intravascular compartment.","1999-01-29","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:52","","53-62","","1","1437","","Biochim Biophys Acta","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 9931432","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Tritium; Rats, Wistar; Tissue Distribution; Receptors, LDL/biosynthesis; Phospholipids/analysis; Triglycerides/analysis; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Apolipoprotein B-100; Apolipoproteins B/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Cholesterol/analysis; Fat Emulsions, Intravenous/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EES significantly enhanced the total serum BA  concentration and that of taurine-conjugated BAs, more pronounced the secondary  BAs taurodeoxycholic, tauroursodeoxycholic and taurolithocholic acid. These  secondary BAs are produced in the intestine by bacteria due to  7alpha-dehydroxylation of the primary BAs cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid.  Because of unchanged free BAs, also produced by intestinal bacteria due to  deconjugation, the results were interpreted as a sign of disturbed transport of  BAs into the liver.

To investigate the transformation of mestranol to ethinyl  estradiol, an in vitro assay was used with human liver microsomes from four  different donors. Incubation of a fixed concentration of mestranol (3 mumol/L)  with varying concentrations of CYP inhibitors revealed strong inhibition of  ethinyl estradiol formation by sulfaphenazole, a specific CYP2C9 inhibitor, with  an average inhibitor concentration at one half of Emax (IC50) of 3.6 mumol/L  (range, 1.8-8.3 mumol/L) and an average maximal inhibitory capacity (Emax) of 75%  (range, 60-91%). Troleandomycin (a CYP3A3/4 inhibitor) and quinidine (a CYP2D6  inhibitor), however, produced no substantial inhibitory activity.  alpha-Naphthoflavone (a CYP1A1/2 inhibitor only at concentrations < 2 mumol/L and  a CYP2C9 inhibitor at higher concentrations) had a weak inhibitory effect on  ethinyl estradiol formation (< 20% decrease in mestranol demethylation activity).  Of the three antifungal azoles tested, miconazole strongly inhibited mestranol  demethylation, with an average IC50 of 1.5 mumol/L (range, 0.7-3.2 mumol/L) and  an average Emax of 90% (range, 77-100%), whereas fluconazole displayed relatively  weak inhibition only at the highest concentration of 50 mumol/L (mean reduction  in demethylation activity was 29%). Itraconazole produced no meaningful  inhibition. Strong inhibition of ethinyl estradiol formation by sulfaphenazole  suggests a major contribution of CYP2C9 to this reaction.","1997-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","193-200","","3","37","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9089421","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Biotransformation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cells, Cultured; *Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/physiology; Fluconazole/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*metabolism; Antifungal Agents/pharmacokinetics; Estradiol Congeners/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Itraconazole/pharmacokinetics; Ketoconazole/pharmacokinetics; Mestranol/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Microsomes, Liver/*enzymology/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cells prepared by a perfusion technique provided a pure preparation of epithelial  cells and could be manipulated to produce crypt-villus units or villi alone. On a  total protein basis, the abundance of LDL receptors in villus cell membranes was  half that in hepatic membranes. The level of receptors in both tissues was  reduced by feeding an atherogenic diet but was increased only in the liver by  ethinyl estradiol-induced hypocholesterolemia. The level of LDL receptor mRNA in  intestinal epithelial cells was somewhat lower than in liver. Regulation of LDL  receptor mRNA was similar to that of protein. Judged by the ratio of mRNA in  villus cells to the villus-crypt unit and nuclear run-on assay for LDL receptor  gene transcription, we conclude that LDL receptor mRNA is produced in the villus  cells. The effect of fat feeding was regulated at the level of transcription.  Expression in villus cells in ileum was severalfold higher than in jejunum and  higher than in the liver. Together the results suggest serum cholesterol level is  not the prime determinant of LDL receptor level in intestine, but LDL degradation  in this organ may be regulated by factors in the lumen.","1995-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","G60-72","","1 Pt 1","269","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7631802","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Intestinal Absorption; Tissue Distribution; Liver/metabolism; Transcription, Genetic; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Jejunum/metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Diet, Atherogenic; Receptors, LDL/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moxestrol bypasses the alpha-fetoprotein 'protective  barrier' and gains access to estrogen receptors. Analysis of [3H]moxestrol uptake  by radioautography and by cell nuclear isolation and counting of radioactivity  revealed a marked increase in the number of estrogen receptors and estrophilic  cells in the brain during late fetal and early postnatal development. Assays of  cytosol estrogen receptors were conducted in parallel and revealed a comparable  pattern of development. The increase in estrogen receptors and labeling was  especially great from embryonic day (E) 15 to E18. Cytosol assays revealed a low  level of receptors in the whole brain on E13. Radioautography revealed that  clearly labeled cells in the hypothalamus and preoptic area were virtually absent  on E13 but were evident on E15, with marked increases occurring between E15 and  E18, both in number of labeled cells and in intensity of labeling per cell.  Within the cerebral cortex the dorsal cingulate cortex was the most extensively  labeled area; however, clearcut labeling was not evident on E13 or E15. Thus, the  development of cortical estrogen receptors occurs somewhat later than that in the  hypothalamus and preoptic area. The perinatal increase in estrogen receptors  usually begins several days after the birthdates of neurons in these estrophilic  regions of the brain, and corresponds to the early responsiveness of these  neurons to the organizational and activational influences of estrogen.","1983-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","7-18","","1","313","","Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 6661666","","","","Female; Animals; Tritium; Mice; Autoradiography; Tissue Distribution; Pregnancy; Fetus; Receptors, Estrogen/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Brain/*embryology/metabolism/ultrastructure; Cell Fractionation; Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure; Estradiol Congeners/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to  determine whether metabolic rate influenced EE2 uptake in male killifish  (Fundulus heteroclitus), based on the hypothesis that the mechanism of EE2 uptake  at the gills is similar to that of oxygen. F. heteroclitus were exposed to 100  ng/L radiolabeled [³H]EE2 for 2 h while swimming at 0, 15, and 40 cm/s. A  positive linear correlation between the rates of oxygen consumption (MO₂) and EE2  accumulation was seen (r² = 0.99, p<0.01), with more EE2 taken up at higher  swimming speeds, suggesting that oxygen uptake predicts EE2 uptake. EE2 tended to  accumulate in the liver (where lipophilic toxicants are metabolized), the gall  bladder (where metabolized toxicants enter bile), and the gut (where bile is  received). In a subsequent experiment killifish were exposed to both hypoxic and  hyperoxic conditions (PO₂=70-80 Torr, and PO₂=400-500 Torr respectively). Despite  significant decreases in MO₂ during hypoxia, EE2 uptake rates increased only  slightly with hypoxia, but in individual fish there was still a significant  correlation between MO₂ and EE2 uptake. This correlation was lost during  hyperoxia, and EE2 uptake rates did not change significantly in hyperoxia. Marked  influences of salinity on EE2 uptake rate occurred regardless of the oxygen  condition, with higher uptake rates in 50% seawater than in freshwater or 100%  seawater. Tissue distribution of EE2 in these exposures may have been influenced  by changes in tissue blood flow patterns and oxygen supply. These data will be  useful in eventually constructing a predictive model to manage the optimal timing  for discharge of EE2 from sewage treatment plants into receiving waters.","2013-08-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","43-51","","","138-139","","Aquat Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of  hormone and tracer data indicated that 36% of the E2 and 41% of the EE2 were  removed during the cell's 84-h hydraulic retention time (HRT). The observed  attenuation was most likely the result of sorption to hydrophobic surfaces in the  wetland coupled with biotransformation. Sorption was indicated by the retardation  of the hormones relative to the conservative tracer. Biotransformation was  indicated by elevated concentrations of the E2 metabolite, estrone.

In order to follow the intrahepatic  metabolism of the cholesteryl esters of LDL in vivo, the liver was subfractioned  into parenchymal and Kupffer cells by a low temperature cell isolation procedure.  In control rats, the LDL cholesteryl esters were mainly taken up by the Kupffer  cells. After uptake, the [3H]cholesteryl esters are rapidly hydrolyzed, followed  by release of [3H]cholesterol from the cells to other sites in the body. Up to 24  h after injection of LDL, only 9% of the radioactivity appeared in the bile,  whereas after 72 h, this value was 30%. Hepatic and especially the parenchymal  cell uptake of [3H]cholesteryl esters from LDL was strongly increased upon 17  alpha-ethinylestradiol treatment (3 days, 5 mg/kg). After rapid hydrolysis of the  esters, [3H]cholesterol was both secreted into bile (28% of the injected dose in  the first 24 h) as well as stored inside the cells as re-esterified cholesterol  ester. It is concluded that uptake of human LDL by the liver in untreated rats is  not efficiently coupled to biliary secretion of cholesterol (derivatives), which  might be due to the anatomical localization of the principal uptake site, the  Kupffer cells. In contrast, uptake of LDL cholesterol ester by liver hepatocytes  is tightly coupled to bile excretion. The Kupffer cell uptake of LDL might be  necessary in order to convert LDL cholesterol (esters) into a less toxic form.  This activity can be functional in animals with low receptor activity on  hepatocytes, as observed in untreated rats, or after diet-induced down-regulation  of hepatocyte LDL receptors in other animals.","1986-07-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","8908-8913","","19","261","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3722182","","","","Humans; Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Tissue Distribution; Bile/metabolism; Kupffer Cells/metabolism; Liver/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Cholesterol, LDL/*metabolism; Lipoproteins, LDL/*blood/isolation & purification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Natural estrogens, including estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), and synthetic  estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) together contribute to most of the  estrogenic activity in sewage effluents and receiving water. Degradation,  particularly aerobic biodegradation was found to be the dominant removal  mechanism in these environments. There are a number of factors such as  temperature, pH, SRT, HRT and biomass concentration that can affect the rate of  biodegradation. This paper reports the results of investigations in to the  relationship between the equivalent biomass concentration and degradation rate  constants for compounds E1, E2 and EE2 in various environments. It was found that  a higher biomass concentration leads to higher rate constants, and relatively  good linear correlations (R2 =0.73, 0.79 and 0.73) between the logarithm of the  rate constants and the corresponding logarithm equivalent biomass concentration  (EBC) values were obtained.","2008-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1321-1330","","12","29","","Environ Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19149353","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Animals; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Algorithms; Temperature; Biomass; Sewage/*chemistry; Industrial Waste; Waste Disposal, Fluid/*methods; Water Purification/*methods; *Biodegradation, Environmental; Estradiol Congeners/analysis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Estradiol/analysis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Estrogens/analysis/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Estrone/analysis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/analysis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using 300 microL plasma, the methods were validated over the  concentration ranges of 0.01-2 ng/mL and 0.1-20 ng/mL for EE and NE (or LN),  respectively. The existing methods for the determination of the oral  contraceptives in human plasma require large volumes of plasma (> or =500  microL), and sample extraction is labor-intensive. The LC run time is at least 6  min, enabling analysis of only about 100 samples a day. In the present work the  throughput was greatly improved by employing a semi-automated sample preparation  process involving liquid-liquid extraction and derivatization with dansyl  chloride followed by UPLC separation on a small particle size column achieving a  run time of 2.7 min. The validation and actual sample analysis results show that  both methods are rugged, precise, accurate, and well suitable to support  pharmacokinetic studies where approximately 300 samples can be extracted and  analyzed in a day.","2007-06-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:37","","69-76","","1-2","852","","J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 17258945","","","","Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Chromatography, Liquid/*methods; Automation; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/blood/pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/blood/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The stability of 17alpha-ethynylestradiol in sterile soil, decreased  removal in the absence of oxygen, and the response of dissipation kinetics to  variation in temperature and moisture suggested that the removal was microbially  mediated.

Moxestrol  and other estrogens, but not progestagens, androgens or corticosteroids, blocked  the apomorphine-induced increase in striatal acetylcholine (ACh) levels. This  effect required the repeated administration of moxestrol to develop and lasted  for at least 24 hr after the final moxestrol injection. Moxestrol-treatment alone  did not alter striatal ACh levels nor did it affect striatal choline  acetyltransferase or acetylcholinesterase activities. This estrogen did not  modify either the basal or the apomorphine-induced decrease in striatal dopamine  turnover. In rats with a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the nigro-striatal dopamine  pathway, moxestrol antagonized the contralateral circling elicited by  apomorphine. The effect of moxestrol on the apomorphine-induced increase in  striatal ACh levels was abolished by hypophysectomy and mimicked by pituitary  transplants under the renal capsule. These findings, together with previous  clinical and pharmacological observations, strongly support the hypothesis that  moxestrol exerts an antidopaminergic effect at the striatal level by decreasing  dopaminergic postsynaptic transmission via mediation of the pituitary gland.","1980-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","179-185","","1","214","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7391967","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Biotransformation; Sex Factors; Prolactin/blood; Estrogens/metabolism; Motor Activity/drug effects; Castration; Dopamine/metabolism; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacology; *Dopamine Antagonists; Acetylcholine/metabolism; Apomorphine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Corpus Striatum/drug effects/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Hypophysectomy; Pituitary Gland/physiology/transplantation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adverse effects have been reported in fish  exposed to this chemical, such as vitellogenin induction or alteration of gonad  structure. In this study, the effects of EE2 on sex steroid profile in juvenile  turbot (Psetta maxima) were investigated in a 15-day in vivo experiment. An  analytical method was developed for the simultaneous gas chromatography/mass  spectrometry determination of 14 steroids in gonads, plasma and bile. The impact  of EE2 on the endocrine status of juvenile turbot was sex-dependent, since males  were much more sensitive than females. Even at very low concentration (3.5 ng  l(-1)), EE2 depressed androgen production as well as plasma levels in males.  Androstenedione and 11-ketotestosterone were highly affected by EE2-exposure,  since their production was suppressed in EE2-treated males. Furthermore, testis  estrogen production and conjugation increased as a consequence of EE2 exposure.  Overall, the ratio of androgens to estrogens in EE2-exposed males dropped in  testis and plasma and reached values observed in females. These results indicate  that juvenile male turbots are susceptible to hormonal imbalance as a consequence  of short-term exposure to environmentally relevant EE2 levels.","2006-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1274-1286","","8","64","","Chemosphere","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16490234","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Organ Specificity; Tissue Distribution; Bile/metabolism; Testis/metabolism; Flatfishes/growth & development/*metabolism; Ovary/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/blood/*toxicity; Gonadal Steroid Hormones/blood/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/blood/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The radiochemical 4c [IV alpha ME2,  (17,20E)-21[125I]iodo-11 alpha-methoxy-19-norpregna-1,3, 5(10),20-tetraene-3,17  beta-diol] was evaluated in immature female rats and the results compared to  those previously reported for 4a (IVE2) and 4b (IV beta ME2) to determine the  influence of 11-substitution on the ability of the compounds to function as  estrogen receptor-seeking agents in vivo. The results indicated that the uptake  of 11 alpha-methoxy derivative in the target organ was substantially lower, of  shorter duration, with a much smaller specific receptor binding component than  the other two radioligands. The distribution profile of the three 17  alpha-iodovinyl estrogens paralleled that previously reported for the  corresponding 17 alpha-ethynyl estrogens and this study suggests that the in vivo  pharmacological results reported for the 17 alpha-ethynyl estrogens may be used  to predict the in vivo behavior of the corresponding 17 alpha-iodovinyl analogs.","1989","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","3-9","","1","16","","Int J Rad Appl Instrum B","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2714998","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tissue Distribution; Isotope Labeling; Molecular Structure; Stereoisomerism; Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Iodine Radioisotopes/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics; Norpregnenes/chemical synthesis/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was performed to elucidate the significance of this capacity in  ethinyl estradiol-induced cholestasis by direct visualization of the zonal  involvement in taurocholate transport. The acinar distribution of  [3H]taurocholate was determined by histoautoradiographical study of cryopreserved  liver slices in normal rats and rats treated with ethinyl estradiol for 5 days.  Silver grain densities over the different acinar zones were estimated on  digitized image analysis. In control animals, histoautoradiographical study  performed 4 min after the start of perfusion showed restriction of taurocholate  to acinar zone 1. In contrast, in ethinyl estradiol-treated animals, taurocholate  was also found in zone 2 and, in smaller concentrations, in zone 3. In control  animals, the relative blackenings by silver grains of acinar zones 1, 2 and 3  were 66% +/- 1.2%, 25% +/- 1.6% and 5% +/- 0.6%, respectively. After 5 days of  ethinyl estradiol treatment, blackenings were 58% +/- 1.5%, 36% +/- 2.1% and 12%  +/- 0.8%, respectively. As early as 15 sec after injection of [3H]taurocholate,  the bile canalicular areas of the cell plates and the bile ductules of ethinyl  estradiol-treated animals were labeled as intensely as those of control animals.  Our results demonstrate ethinyl estradiol-induced recruitment of the acinar zones  2 and 3 for hepatobiliary taurocholate transport.

A marked irreversible binding of radioactivity in the squamous  cervico-vaginal epithelium of mice given intravenous injections of 14C-CCl4 was  revealed by autoradiography of solvent-extracted tissue. The localization of  binding in the mouse genital tract incubated with 14C-CCl4 under air was similar  to that observed in vivo. Bound radioactivity was also present in the cylindrical  epithelium of the rabbit vagina incubated with 14C-CCl4 in vitro. For a  comparison, no preferential binding of radiolabelled diethylstilbestrol or  ethinylestradiol was observed in the mouse cervico-vaginal epithelium. The level  of irreversible binding to PMSG-primed (pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin)  vaginal epithelial 100 x g supernatants of mice and rats incubated with 14C-CCl4  under air was low. Addition of the reducing agent dithionite to the incubations  increased the binding in the vaginal epithelium 20-fold. In juvenile mice and  rats injected with 14C-CCl4, the levels of metabolites in the epithelium were  low, whereas PMSG-primed juvenile rats contained a higher level of metabolites.  The results show that the cervico-vaginal epithelium can metabolically activate  CCl4 to reactive metabolites and suggest that the metabolism is under endocrine  control.","1989-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","336-342","","5","65","","Pharmacol Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Denmark PMID: 2516313","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rabbits; Rats, Inbred Strains; Mice; Autoradiography; Biotransformation; Carbon Dioxide/metabolism; Epithelium/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Diethylstilbestrol/pharmacology; Carbon Tetrachloride/*pharmacokinetics; Cervix Uteri/*metabolism; Vagina/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Longterm administration of  levonorgestrel (0.250 mg daily) for three months did not change the metabolisms  of both model substances tested. In contrast, ethynylestradiol (0.050 mg) alone  and also the combination with levonorgestrel markedly retarded the elimination  rate of caffeine and metamizol-metabolites. This fact should be taken into  consideration in drug therapy.","1991","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1388-1396","","24","113","","Zentralbl Gynakol","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 1808966","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Administration Schedule; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Caffeine/pharmacokinetics; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/physiology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Biotransformation/*drug effects/physiology; Dipyrone/pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Embryos  exhibited a notable differential susceptibility to the embryotoxic effects of  parents E2 vs EE when these estrogens were added directly to the media at the  onset of the culture period. At initial concentrations of 0.1 mM, E2 failed to  produce statistically significant effects whereas EE elicited marked  embryotoxicity. Inclusion of a P-450-dependent biotransformation system in the  culture media resulted in a significant attenuation of the embryotoxic effects of  parent E2 vs EE when these estrogens were added directly to the media at the  onset of the culture period. At initial concentrations of 0.1 mM, E2 failed to  produce statistically embryotoxicity by hepatic S9. The divergent results  produced by the two steroids could not be attributed to differences in rates of  catecholestrogen generation in the culture medium or by the conceptuses. The  results demonstrate definitive dissimilarities between the effects of two  steroidal estrogens on developmental parameters and document marked differences  in the effects of biotransformation on their embryotoxic potential. The data  strongly suggest that the embryotoxicity of these steroids is not mediated via  interactions with estrogen receptors. Additionally, the data show that the  differential capacity of these two steroids to produce embryotoxic effects is  diametrically opposite to earlier reported patterns of their carcinogenic  potential in the Syrian hamster kidney.","1988-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","629-634","","6","29","","J Steroid Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3386229","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Biotransformation; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Pregnancy; Microsomes, Liver/metabolism; Organ Culture Techniques; Estradiol/*pharmacology; Embryo, Mammalian/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Incubation of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, labeled with 14C in both  ethynyl group carbons, resulted in the formation of D-14C-homoestrone (identified  by high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry) and 14CO2. The D-homoestrone appears to be formed by a  rearrangement in which one ethynyl group carbon is incorporated into the D ring  of the steroid (D-homoannulation) and the second is subsequently removed as CO2.  Cofactor, inhibition, and subcellular fractionation studies on the rate of 14CO2  formation showed that the ethynyl group is oxidized by cytochrome P-450. Hepatic  microsomes isolated from rhesus monkeys treated with phenobarbital, but not  3-methylcholanthrene or pregnenelone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, resulted in increased  rates of 14CO2 formation. Oxidation of the 17 alpha-ethynyl group is postulated  to produce a high energy intermediate which is rearranged by D-homoannulation.  However, as an alternative reaction, this unstable intermediate might covalently  bind and inactivate the cytochrome P-450 enzymes catalyzing its formation. In  support of this hypothesis, both cytochrome P-450 concentrations and the rate of  catalysis of the D-homoannulation pathway by this enzyme were significantly  decreased in hepatic microsomes from rhesus monkeys which had been administered  mestranol and/or ethynerone (17 alpha-ethynylated steroids) at dosage levels  mimicking human exposure to oral contraceptive agents.","1983-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","531-536","","6","11","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6140135","","","","Female; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Biotransformation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism; Microsomes, Liver/enzymology; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; Steroids/*metabolism; Macaca mulatta; Phenobarbital/pharmacology; Subcellular Fractions/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ring released approximately 1 mg of norethindrone  acetate (NET-Ac) and 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol (EE) daily. A total of 60  women were enrolled to use the ring in a schedule of 3 weeks in/1 week out. Serum  norethindrone (NET) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) levels were assayed twice weekly  in cycles 6, 9, and 13. Mean NET concentrations between cycles 6 and 9 were  relatively stable between 13 and 19 nmol/L but showed a 10%-21% decrease in all  centers between cycles 9 and 13. Mean EE concentrations ranged from 75 to 103  pmol/L, but did not have the same decrease as NET between cycles 9 and 13. Cycles  with progesterone peaks (> 9.6 nmol/L) compatible with some luteal activity  occurred in 4% of cycles sampled in Sydney, 3% in Santo Domingo, and 26% in Los  Angeles. Half of these cycles exhibited at least one progesterone value > 32  nmol/L with three of 18 occurring in noncompliant cycles. Heavier body weight was  associated with increased probability of luteal activity. Based on serum  estradiol peaks > 400 pmol/L, eight of 81 cycles appeared to have marked  follicular activity with no luteal activity. No pregnancies occurred. Nausea was  reported by about half the subjects in approximately 10% of the visits (mainly in  the first 1-2 days in the first cycle immediately after ring insertion). Vomiting  was reported by 20% of subjects early in the first cycle only. Headache was  reported on occasion by nearly 50% of the women, but the relationship to ring use  was uncertain. Vaginal discharge was reported by 17 women (82% of these were from  one clinic). Of 60 women, 14 discontinued before completing the study, but only  two discontinuations were for medical reasons. Small but statistically  significant changes occurred in lipid levels in two of the three centers. All  changes remained within normal limits and were similar to those seen with many  oral contraceptives. It appears that this ring may perform slightly differently  in different populations, but is a highly satisfactory method of contraception  for many women. Minor modifications in design could provide higher levels of  steroid release and in the later months of the ring life span would assure  continuing high levels of contraceptive protection for heavier women.","1999-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","311-318","","5","59","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10494485","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Biology; Physiology; Research Methodology; United States; California; Australia; Developing Countries; Developed Countries; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; Ovary; *Ethinyl Estradiol; *Research Report; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; Norethindrone Acetate; *Vaginal Rings; Americas; North America; Northern America; *Contraceptive Devices, Female/adverse effects; *Women; Urogenital System; Contraceptive Agents, Female/*administration & dosage; *Clinical Research--women; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone; *Metabolic Effects--women; Ovary/drug effects; Ovarian Follicle/drug effects; *Norethindrone Acetate; Latin America; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; *Contraceptive Effectiveness; *Ovarian Effects; Caribbean; Corpus Luteum/drug effects; Dominican Republic; Genitalia; Genitalia, Female; Menstrual Cycle/drug effects/*physiology; Oceania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One ring can be used for up to a year  (13 cycles). AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes this novel method of  contraception, including the delivery system and the hormonal components. We  describe the potential market, how it is used, the pharmacokinetic properties of  the device, and results of clinical trials including efficacy, bleeding profile,  acceptability, and safety. EXPERT OPINION: The SA/EE CVR represents the first  long-lasting user-controlled hormonal contraceptive device. The bleeding pattern  is highly favorable and consistent over the entire year and is associated with  very low discontinuation.

To analyze mechanisms  behind these effects, bile acid enterohepatic circulation was studied with direct  methods in cats treated with peroral contraceptive steroids for 3 months, cats  oophorectomized 1-2 months before study, and female control animals. Both  administration of contraceptive steroids and oophorectomy reduced the bile acid  pool size and bile acid synthesis rate. Contraceptive steroids increased water  secretion by the liver at low bile acid secretion rates, reduced bile acid  accumulation in the gallbladder, and increased the recycling rate of the bile  acid pool. Oophorectomy did not significantly change the relation between bile  acid and water secretion by the liver. The reduced bile acid pool size in animals  receiving contraceptive steroids can be explained by an increased recycling rate  induced by an enhanced water secretion by the liver. The possibility of a direct  effect on the hepatic synthesis of bile acids by both administration of  contraceptive steroids and oophorectomy cannot be excluded.","1987-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","827-832","","7","22","","Scand J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3118450","","","","Female; Animals; Cats; Levonorgestrel; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacology; Enterohepatic Circulation/*drug effects; Bile Acids and Salts/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; *Ovariectomy; Norgestrel/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little information is available on the  mechanisms by which renin and angiotensinogen synthesis and secretion are  regulated in these tissues. In view of the importance of steroid hormones in the  regulation of hepatic angiotensinogen, we have examined the effects of  dexamethasone, ethinyl estradiol, or dihydrotestosterone on angiotensinogen gene  expression in peripheral or cerebral tissues of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) or  spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Following a single injection of  dexamethasone (7 mg/kg) the concentrations of angiotensinogen mRNA increased in  nearly all organs examined. The differences to controls were higher in SHR than  in WKY. Dexamethasone in low doses (10 micrograms/kg/day) given for 10 days did  not alter angiotensinogen mRNA or blood pressure in control animals, but  increased both parameters in the hypertensive strain. The response to a single  dose of ethinyl estradiol (3 mg/kg) was not as uniform as that to dexamethasone,  and a tendency for a higher sensitivity was found in SHR. High stimulation rates  were found in liver and kidneys of both strains. A single dose of  dihydrotestosterone (10 mg/kg) did not significantly affect angiotensinogen mRNA  in any organ. Only when a high dose of 50 mg/kg was given daily for 20 days, was  angiotensinogen mRNA increased in some tissues. These data indicate that  glucocorticoids and estrogens participate in the regulation of angiotensinogen  gene expression in several extrahepatic tissues. The higher sensitivity to  glucocorticoids in SHR may be relevant for the development of hypertension in  this strain.","1993-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","683-708","","4","15","","Clin Exp Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8374610","","","","Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Drug Resistance; Tissue Distribution; RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects; Dexamethasone/pharmacology; Hypertension/etiology; Steroids/*pharmacology; Rats, Inbred WKY; Rats, Inbred SHR; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Angiotensinogen/*genetics; Dihydrotestosterone/pharmacology; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: The effect of steady-state  telaprevir (administered 750 mg every 8 hours) on the steady-state  pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and norethindrone (NE) was evaluated  in 24 healthy women receiving oral contraceptives (OC) containing 0.5 mg NE and  0.035 mg EE for at least 3 months at the time of screening. This was a phase 1,  open-label, single-center, nonrandomized study that included a cycle 1 (OC only  for 21 days, followed by no OC for 7 days), cycle 2 (OC plus telaprevir for 21  days, followed by telaprevir alone for 7 days), and a follow-up period. RESULTS:  When administration with or without telaprevir was compared, the least-squares  mean ratios (90% confidence limits) for EE were 0.74 (0.68; 0.80) for C(max),  0.67 (0.63; 0.71) for C(min), and 0.72 (0.69; 0.75) for AUC; neither NE nor  telaprevir exposure was affected. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the OC may be  compromised by the 26% to 33% reduction in EE exposure. Therefore, alternative  methods of nonhormonal contraception should be used when hormonal contraceptives  are coadministered with telaprevir and for up to 2 weeks following cessation of  telaprevir.","2012-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:29:49","","1574-1583","","10","52","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22039291","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Cross-Over Studies; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Young Adult; Progesterone/blood; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Luteinizing Hormone/blood; Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Hepacivirus; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Protease Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incorporation of drug adsorbates onto crospovidone into the  polyisobutene blends yielded crystal-free patches. The drug release from these  patches was independent of polyisobutene's molecular weight distribution,  probably because the drug release occurred mainly through fluid filled channels.  By contrast, the drug release from acrylic adhesives was independent of whether  the patches contained pure drugs or drug adsorbates onto crospovidone. A higher  degree of saturation (or supersaturation) in these systems resulted in a higher  thermodynamic activity of the drugs and hence a higher drug release. The  crystal-free acrylic and polyisobutene patches did not show drug  recrystallization after 3 months at 25°C/60 RH and 40°C/75 RH. The adhesive  properties of polyisobutene patches were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The  area under the curve of force-distance curves recorded with the texture analyzer  correlated well with the in vivo skin adhesion. The elongation at detachment  showed the same trend as the in vivo matrix creep. Crospovidone contents ≤ 30%  had no detrimental effect on the adhesive properties of the patches.","2010-12-23","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","675-684","","5","41","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Preventing pregnancy is important in HIV-infected women  receiving efavirenz as part of their antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: The effects  of coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics (PK)  of the active components (ethinyl estradiol [EE] and 17-deacetyl norgestimate  [NGMN]) of Ortho Cyclen(®) (Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Raritan,  NJ, USA) were investigated in 28 healthy HIV-negative women. The peak plasma  concentration (C(max)), area under the concentration-time curve for a dosing  interval (AUC([τ])), and lowest plasma concentration (C(min)) for EE and NGMN  during cycles of treatment with Ortho Cyclen with and without coadministration of  efavirenz were compared. Additionally, a post hoc exploratory analysis was  conducted to assess the effect of efavirenz on the PK of an additional progestin,  levonorgestrel (LNG). RESULTS: Exposures to EE were similar during  coadministration of efavirenz and Ortho Cyclen to those during administration of  Ortho Cyclen alone. Exposures to NGMN were substantially decreased following  coadministration of efavirenz and Ortho Cyclen (adjusted geometric means for  C(max), AUC([τ]) and C(min) decreased by 46%, 64% and 82%, respectively) compared  with Ortho Cyclen alone. Consistent with NGMN, LNG exposures were decreased  80-86% by efavirenz. CONCLUSIONS: Although efavirenz had no significant effect on  the PK of EE, exposures to the progestin components of Ortho Cyclen, NGMN and  LNG, were substantially reduced. The results reinforce the need to use reliable  methods of barrier contraception, even when taking oral contraceptives and  efavirenz.","2011","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:33","","149-156","","2","16","","Antivir Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21447863","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Young Adult; Alkynes; Cyclopropanes; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Anti-HIV Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Estrogens/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Benzoxazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, experiments were  undertaken to examine the effects of a synthetic pharmaceutical endocrine  disruptor, ethynylestradiol (EE2), given in water at 5 or 50 ng/L and sampled at  days 0 (control), 3 and 7 after exposure, on hepatic phase I and II  biotransformation and hormonal pathways of juvenile salmon using quantitative  (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Vtg ELISA and 7-ethoxyresorufin  O-deethylase (EROD) catalytic activity. Our data show that EE2 produced time- and  concentration-specific modulation of estrogen receptor isoforms (ERalpha, ERbeta)  and androgen receptor-beta (ARbeta). EE2 produced a concentration-specific  induction of vitellogenin (Vtg) and zona radiata protein (Zr-protein) at day 3  after exposure. At day 7, Vtg and Zr-protein mRNA (and plasma Vtg protein)  expression were significantly decreased in the group given 5 ng EE2/L, compared  to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group. In the xenobiotic biotransformation  pathway, EE2 produced a significant increase of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-alpha  (AhRalpha) at day 3 in the group given 5 ng EE2/L and AhRbeta was decreased at  the same concentration at day 7. While CYP3A was not significantly affected by  EE2 exposure, the CYP1A1, AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) and AhR repressor  (AhRR) mRNA showed an apparent EE2 concentration and time-dependent decrease. The  expression of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) and glutathione  S-transferase class pi-like (GSTpi-like) mRNA were decreased after exposure to  50ng EE2/L at both day 3 and 7 after exposure. The effect of EE2 on the CYP1A1  gene expressions paralleled effect on EROD and AhRR mRNA, suggesting a direct  role of EE2 in controlling cellular detoxification machinery. Interestingly, the  carrier vehicle, DMSO produced significant time-dependent induction of estrogenic  (ERalpha, Vtg and Zr-protein) responses, compared with blank (i.e. without DMSO)  controls at day 7 post-exposure. The effect of DMSO totally underscored the  observed EE2 effect at day 7 after exposure. In general, these findings support  previous reports on the endocrine effects of EE2, in addition to effects on  hepatic biotransformation system. In view of the data presented here and our  recent studies, the use of DMSO as carrier vehicle in endocrine toxicological  experimental studies should be re-evaluated.","2007-11-30","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","113-123","","2","85","","Aquat Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 17875331","","","","Animals; Time Factors; Biotransformation/drug effects; Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects; DNA Primers/chemistry; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; Autocrine Communication/drug effects; Dimethyl Sulfoxide/toxicity; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/drug effects/genetics/metabolism; Receptors, Estrogen/drug effects/genetics/metabolism; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary; Salmo salar/*metabolism; Vitellogenins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: LTG serum concentrations of female patients using either  no hormonal contraception (n=18), an ethinyl estradiol (EE)-containing (n=11), or  a progestogen (PG)-only-containing compound (n=16) were analyzed. Patients were  recruited prospectively, and blood samples were drawn during drug fasting and at  steady-state conditions. Comedication with enzyme inducers, valproate,  topiramate, or sertraline was not allowed. Some patients changed groups and thus  served as their own controls. Samples were analyzed by a gas chromatography/ mass  spectroscopy method. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical comparison  of the groups. RESULTS: The LTG serum concentration-to-dose ratio (CDR),  expressed as (mg/L)/(mg/d) was significantly lower in women using EE than in the  control group (mean+/-SD, 0.010+/-0.004 vs. 0.017+/-0.006; p=0.003). The CDR in  women using PG was 0.02+/-0.007, which was not statistically different from  controls. No difference was found in CDR between women using either oral,  topical, or parenteral PG. Five women switched from the control to the EE group  and experienced a considerable reduction in CDR. An increase of the CDR toward  control level was seen in the two women who changed from EE to PG. CONCLUSIONS:  It is the EE component of oral contraceptives that interacts with LTG. The  PG-only compounds did not alter LTG serum concentrations in this study. These  findings should be considered when counselling women with epilepsy in the  childbearing ages.","2005-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1414-1417","","9","46","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16146436","","","","Humans; Female; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Lamotrigine; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Anticonvulsants/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Progestins/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Triazines/*blood/metabolism/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Percentage binding was decreased in both species by the 19-nor  compounds, but not by megestrol. Androstenedione levels were unaffected in human  subjects, but effects of both estrogens and progestins were seen in baboons.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: This was a phase 1, single-center, open-label, multipledose,  single-sequence study in healthy females. Eligible subjects (n = 23) were exposed  sequentially to two treatment periods: period 1 (OC alone) and period 2 (OC +  siponimod) in two consecutive menstrual periods. PK parameters were assessed on  day 21 of both treatment periods. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing  hormone (LH), estradiol, and progesterone concentrations were measured at  baseline and days 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, and 23 of each period. Largest  ovarian follicle size and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentration were  measured and Hoogland score was calculated at baseline and day 21 of each period.

OBJECTIVE: The primary study  objective was to determine the effect of vicriviroc, a C-C chemokine receptor  type 5 inhibitor, alone or in the presence of ritonavir, on the pharmacokinetics  (AUC and C(max)) of the study OC (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 0.035 mg + norethindrone  [NET] 1 mg). A secondary objective was to monitor the safety and tolerability of  vicriviroc plus an OC with and without ritonavir. METHODS: This was a randomized,  open-label, parallel-group, single-center study with a fixed-sequence crossover  design. Female subjects were randomized into 2 groups and treated for 2 menstrual  cycles. In cycle 1, all received the OC alone, per standard 28-day pack  instructions. On the first 10 days of cycle 2, group 1 received OC + vicriviroc  and group 2 received OC + ritonavir; on the following 11 days, both groups  received OC + vicriviroc + ritonavir. Blood samples were collected up to 24 hours  after dosing on prespecified days. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including  AUC(0-24), C(max), and C(min), were calculated using noncompartmental methods,  and drug interactions were evaluated using an ANOVA model by treatment group.  Adverse events were collected using physical examination, vital sign  measurements, clinical laboratory analysis, electrocardiography, and questioning  at predefined time points throughout the study to assess the safety profile.  RESULTS: Twenty-seven subjects were enrolled (26 white, 1 black). The median age  and body mass index were 21 years (range, 18-36 years) and 24.5 kg/m(2) (range,  19.1-31.3 kg/m(2)), respectively. Twenty-one subjects completed the study and  were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis; 4 discontinued for reasons  unrelated to study drug and 2 discontinued because of adverse events. Vicriviroc  had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of the OC. EE mean ratio estimates for  C(max) and AUC(0-24) compared with OC administered alone were 91% and 97%,  respectively, and for NET were 106% and 93%. Subjects receiving ritonavir, alone  or with vicriviroc, experienced decreases in exposure of EE (C(max) mean ratio  estimates, 89% and 76%; AUC(0-24) mean ratio estimates, 71% each, for ritonavir  alone and ritonavir with vicriviroc, respectively) and, to a lesser extent,  decreases in NET (C(max) mean ratio estimates 89% each; AUC(0-24) mean ratio  estimates: 93% and 83%, for ritonavir alone and ritonavir with vicriviroc,  respectively). Twenty-two of 27 (81%) subjects reported ≥1 treatment-emergent  adverse event (TEAE). During cycle 1, TEAEs were reported for 18 of 27 (67%)  subjects while receiving OC alone and for 3 of 24 (13%) subjects while receiving  placebo OC. During cycle 2, TEAEs were reported for 8 of 12 (67%) subjects while  receiving vicriviroc with OC, 4 of 12 (33%) subjects while receiving ritonavir  with OC, 7 of 22 (32%) subjects while receiving vicriviroc + ritonavir with OC,  and 2 of 22 (9%) subjects while receiving placebo OC. The most commonly reported  TEAE was headache (vicriviroc + OC, n = 1; ritonavir + OC, n = 3; vicriviroc +  ritonavir + OC, n = 2; OC alone, n = 12; placebo OC, n = 2). No TEAEs were  considered severe. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of healthy female subjects,  vicriviroc had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of EE or NET, whereas  ritonavir, alone or with vicriviroc, was associated with consistent decrease in  exposure of EE and a lesser decrease in NET.","2011-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:32:56","","1503-1514","","10","33","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

METHODS: Twelve women receiving stable valproic acid (VPA) monotherapy for  epilepsy received a combination norethindrone 1.0 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35-microg  tablet daily for 21 days followed by seven daily doses of inert tablets for four  28-day cycles. After a baseline cycle (cycle 1), topiramate 100, 200, and 400 mg  every 12 h was administered in cycles 2 through 4, respectively. Serial blood  samples were obtained on day 20 of each cycle and were analyzed for  norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol, and progesterone by using validated  radioimmunoassay methods. RESULTS: Compared with cycle 1, none of the  norethindrone pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly in the presence of  topiramate, 100-400 mg every 12 h. Individual patient serum progesterone  concentrations measured during each cycle were at or close to the limit of  quantification with no apparent differences among cycles. However, mean area  under the concentration-versus-time curve over the 24-h period (AUC(0-24)) values  for ethinyl estradiol were 18-30% lower in cycles 2 through 4 compared with cycle  1 (p < or = 0.05 for all pairs), whereas mean oral serum clearance (CL/F) values  were 14.7-33.0% higher (p < or = 0.05 for cycles 2 and 4 vs. cycle 1). Mean time  of peak concentration (T(max)) values determined during topiramate therapy were  not significantly different from those at baseline.

As the combination oral contraceptive (COC)  levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol (LNG/EE) may be coadministered in this target  transplant population, the effects of letermovir on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  LNG and EE were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a phase I,  open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study conducted in healthy women (18 - 65  years old) of non-childbearing potential (protocol number: MK-8228 035). On day 1  of period 1, participants received a single dose of COC (LNG 0.15 mg/EE 0.03 mg).  Following a 7-day washout, oral letermovir 480 mg was administered once-daily on  days 1 - 12 of period 2, with a single dose of COC coadministered on day 8. Blood  samples were collected to determine LNG and EE PK, and safety was assessed.  RESULTS: The AUC(0-∞) geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for COC +  letermovir/COC alone were 1.36 (1.30, 1.43) for LNG and 1.42 (1.32, 1.52) for EE,  indicating that letermovir coadministration increased COC exposure.  Coadministration had no clinically-meaningful effect on C(max), t(max), or  apparent terminal T(1/2) for either LNG or EE. All treatments were generally well  tolerated. CONCLUSION: Letermovir coadministration with COC resulted in an  increase in LNG and EE exposure in healthy adult women; however, levels were  within the established safety margins. There was no decrease in LNG or EE  exposure with no apparent risk of contraceptive failure on coadministration of  letermovir and COC. .","2019-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:15:11","","450-457","","9","57","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 31232280","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Drug Interactions; Young Adult; Quinazolines/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/*pharmacokinetics; Acetates/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In view of the vast clinical applications and interactions of steroidal  oral contraceptives with commonly used therapeutic agents, the interaction  potential of certain concomitantly administered therapeutic agents was  investigated in terms of postcoital contraceptive efficacy (pharmacological) and  the pharmacokinetic profile of centchroman in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The  coadministered drugs used in the study were ciprofloxacin, cefixime, amoxicillin,  metronidazole, amlodipine, atenolol, theophylline, metformin, pioglitazone and  glibenclamide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacological activity of centchroman  was evaluated in sperm-positive female rats at 1.5 mg/kg, with or without  coadministered drugs. Rats were sacrificed on Day 10 postcoitus, and autopsy was  performed to check for the presence or absence of implantations. The estrogenic  and antiestrogenic activities of centchroman were evaluated in immature  ovariectomized rats. Pharmacokinetic interaction was studied in normal female  rats with or without coadministered drugs. Serum samples were taken over 120 h  and analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method to  generate the pharmacokinetic profile of centchroman. Pharmacokinetic parameters  were estimated using noncompartmental analysis, and the results were compared.  RESULTS: In pharmacological interaction studies, centchroman alone showed a 100%  success rate when given alone or in the presence of coadministered drugs. The  only exception was amoxicillin coadministration, with 66% rats in the group  showing resorbed implantations. Further investigation with amoxicillin in  ovariectomized immature rats indicates no alteration in the estrogenic and  antiestrogenic profiles of centchroman. In pharmacokinetic interaction studies,  most of the therapeutic agents affected the rate and extent of absorption of  centchroman. In other pharmacokinetic parameters, clearance (CL) remained  unchanged; however, there was decrease in bioavailability (F) and volume of  distribution (V(d)) in some situations. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that  there is no direct link between the altered pharmacokinetics of centchroman and  the failure of pharmacological effect. The pharmacological interaction with  amoxicillin could not be explained on the basis of alteration in the estrogenic  and antiestrogenic activities of centchroman, indicating that different  mechanisms are involved. The findings, however, suggest that amoxicillin  coadministration may result in pharmacological interaction with centchroman and  that caution should be taken in clinical practice.","2006-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:17","","165-173","","2","74","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16860055","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drug Interactions; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Ovariectomy; *Contraceptives, Oral/administration & dosage; Amoxicillin/pharmacology; Centchroman/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Contraceptives, Postcoital; Embryo Implantation/drug effects; Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Cmax GMR of EE and  NET was 1.06 (0.98, 1.16) and 1.04 (0.99, 1.09), respectively. In each case, the  90% CIs satisfied the predefined bioequivalence limits of (0.80, 1.25). Measures  of SHBG and albumin and routine clinical and laboratory safety parameters showed  no clinically meaningful changes. The addition of rofecoxib to the oral  contraceptive was not associated with any clinically important changes in EE or  NET pharmacokinetics and thus would not be anticipated to influence the efficacy  of this contraceptive regimen.","2002-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:22","","215-221","","2","42","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11831545","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Serum Albumin/metabolism; Sulfones; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/pharmacokinetics; Estradiol Congeners/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Lactones/adverse effects/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 61 women were enrolled to use the ring on a  schedule of 3 weeks in/1 week out for four treatment cycles. Serum estradiol,  progesterone, norethindrone (NET), and ethinyl estradiol (EE) levels were assayed  twice weekly in all four treatment cycles. Both CVR performed well, with no  pregnancies occurring and only one cycle of luteal activity suggestive of  ovulation (serum progesterone > 32 nmol/L) occurring with each ring (0.9% of  cycles with the 1/15 ring and 1.2% of cycles with the 1/20 ring). Although there  was significantly more luteal activity in women using the 1/15 CVR (5.9% compared  with 1.2% of cycles), only three cycles with a marked degree of luteal activity  (progesterone > 10 nmol/L) occurred among compliant women. Serum levels of NET  and EE were consistently elevated during use of both rings. There was no  significant difference between serum levels with the two rings because of wide  interindividual variations, although both NET and EE levels tended to be higher  with the 1/20 ring. However, there was a significant difference in EE levels  between the women in Los Angeles and Sydney using the same dose rings. Total  cholesterol, HDL, and LDL cholesterol values were not significantly changed  during treatment. Triglycerides increased but remained within the normal range.  Overall cycle control was good with both formulations, but there was slightly  more cycle disturbance with the lower dose ring. There was no change in mean body  weight during the study, and individual weight changes appeared to be  idiosyncratic. Side effects were infrequent and similar to those reported with  other steroidal contraceptive methods. Three women complained of vaginal  discharge, one with accompanying itch and one with a vaginal Candida infection in  cycle 1. Overall, both of these EE/NET-Ac rings performed well, with only minor  and mainly nonsignificant differences in effect on serum EE, NET, E2, and  progesterone levels and lipids, and on vaginal bleeding patterns.","1999-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","305-310","","5","59","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10494484","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Estradiol/blood; Progesterone/blood; Research Methodology; Studies; United States; Delayed-Action Preparations; California; Australia; Developed Countries; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; *Ethinyl Estradiol; *Research Report; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen; Contraceptive Agents, Female; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; Biocompatible Materials; Norethindrone Acetate; *Contraceptive Devices, Female; *Vaginal Rings; *Comparative Studies; Americas; North America; Northern America; Contraceptive Agents, Female/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Women; *Clinical Research--women; Norethindrone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone; Ovary/drug effects; Ovarian Follicle/drug effects; Vagina; *Norethindrone Acetate; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Silicones; *Contraceptive Effectiveness; Corpus Luteum/drug effects; Oceania; Elastomers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investigation of this effect is important  given the high prevalence of obesity in the US. STUDY DESIGN: This open-label,  uncontrolled, Phase 2b trial stratified 173 women (18-35 years) according to  three BMI groups (Group 1, n = 56, ≤ 30 kg/m²; Group 2, n = 55, > 30 kg/m² and ≤  35 kg/m²; and Group 3, n = 47, > 35 kg/m²). Women used a contraceptive patch  containing 0.55-mg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 2.1-mg gestodene (GSD). The EE/GSD  patch was used weekly for three 28-day cycles (one patch per week for 3  consecutive weeks followed by a 7-day, patch-free interval), and its effect on  ovulation was assessed by the Hoogland score, a composite score that comprises  transvaginal ultrasound and estradiol (E₂) and progesterone levels every 3 days  in Cycles 2 and 3. Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters was a secondary aim  of the study, and blood samples for analytic determination of EE, GSD and sex  hormone-binding globulin were taken during the pretreatment cycle, Cycle 2 and  Cycle 3. Compliance was assessed using diary information and serum drug levels.  RESULTS: In the per-protocol set, there were only six ovulations during the  study, and no participant ovulated in both study cycles. One ovulation occurred  in Group 1, three in Group 2 and two in Group 3. Ovulation inhibition was  unaffected by BMI; in all groups, most participants had Hoogland scores of 1 or 2  (i.e., follicle-like structures < 13 mm: Group 1, ≤ 30 kg/m², 80.0% in Cycle 2,  85.7% in Cycle 3; Group 2, > 30 kg/m² and ≤ 35 kg/m², 61.4% in Cycle 2, 75.0% in  Cycle 3; Group 3, > 35 kg/m², 78.0% in Cycle 2, 72.5% in Cycle 3). Serum levels  of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, E2 and progesterone were  similar between groups. Body weight had a limited effect on EE clearance that was  unlikely to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSION: The EE/GSD patch provided  effective ovulation inhibition, even in women with higher BMI. IMPLICATIONS: This  is the largest-to-date study of physiologic endpoints and found no clinically  important differences in ovarian suppression among obese and normal-weight users  of the EE/GSD contraceptive patch, thus providing reassurance that obese women  can achieve the same high level of contraceptive protection as normal-weight  users.","2014-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","272-279","","3","90","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding  drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is important in individuals taking fostemsavir with  hormonal contraceptives or menopausal or gender-affirming hormonal therapies.  METHODS: Effect of temsavir (active moiety) on the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl  estradiol (EE) and norethindrone (NET) was evaluated in an open-label,  single-sequence, four-cycle, four-treatment study in 26 healthy female  participants (study 206279, NCT02480881). Relevant ARV-contraceptive interaction  studies and guideline recommendations were reviewed; that information was then  applied to other contraceptive methods and hormone-based therapies to predict the  impact of fostemsavir co-administration. RESULTS: Temsavir increased EE  concentrations by 40% and had no effect on NET concentrations. Fostemsavir  co-administration with hormone therapy is not expected to impact hormone  treatment efficacy. Fostemsavir did not impact progestin; therefore,  progestin-only and non-hormonal contraceptives will not be impacted by  fostemsavir. Recommendations for co-administration of fostemsavir and hormonal  contraceptives or menopausal or gender-affirming hormone therapies are based upon  known and predicted DDIs, ensuring adequate hormonal concentrations to maintain  the target effect. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the results of Study 206279 and other  relevant ARV-contraceptive studies, we recommend that when co-administering  fostemsavir with combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and other oestrogen-based  therapies, EE dose should not exceed 30 μg or equivalent, and caution is advised  in the case of individuals with risk factors for thromboembolic events. Other  oestrogen-based therapies may be co-administered with fostemsavir, with  monitoring of oestrogen concentrations and appropriate dose adjustments. No  impact of fostemsavir on COC efficacy is expected.","2023-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","580-587","","5","24","","HIV Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 ViiV Healthcare.

However, the uptake and accumulation  mechanism of SEs by plants is still unclear. In this study, the uptake,  accumulation, and translocation of 17β-E2, a representative SE, were investigated  through a series of wheat hydroponic experiments. Various inhibitors were applied  to explore the uptake pathways of 17β-E2 by wheat. In addition, the effects of  exposure concentrations, coexisting 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and plant  properties on the uptake of 17β-E2 were examined. The results indicated that the  accumulation of 17β-E2 in wheat roots mainly resulted from adsorption and active  uptake that involved aquaporins and anion channels transport. The chlorophyll and  protein contents of plants were positively correlated with the uptake of 17β-E2,  whereas competitive inhibition occurred when 17β-E2 and EE2 coexisted in the same  solution. Nevertheless, the results of a split-root experiment showed that 17β-E2  absorbed by wheat could further migrate in plant via long-distance transport and  ultimately was discharged from plants, suggesting that 17β-E2 was still at risk  of being released even though it had been absorbed by plants. These results could  provide valuable insights into the risk assessment and risk control of the uptake  of SEs by plants.","2021-01-20","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","141979","","","753","","Sci Total Environ","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In the present  study, EE2-Sul was evaluated as a substrate of various transporters known to be  expressed in the kidney. Uptake studies were performed with human epithelial  cells [human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293] that contained individually expressed  organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), organic anion transporter (OAT) forms 3 and  4, and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1). The transporter phenotyping  studies were extended to include insect cell (Sf9) membrane vesicles that  expressed multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) and Madin-Darby canine  kidney cells that expressed OAT1. Based on the results obtained, we concluded  that EE2-Sul serves as a substrate of OAT3 and OAT4, but not OCT2, OAT1, MATE1,  and MRP4. First, EE2-Sul uptake was highly increased in OAT3/HEK-293 cells  (versus mock/HEK-293 cells) and was inhibited by OAT3 inhibitors such as  bromosulfophthalein (BSP), cimetidine, and probenecid. OAT3-mediated uptake also  conformed to single-K(m) (Michaelis constant) kinetics (K(m) = 21.1 microM).  Second, EE2-Sul uptake was also significantly higher in OAT4/HEK-293 cells and  was inhibited by BSP, methotrexate, and probenecid. In contrast to OAT3,  OAT4-dependent uptake was characterized by a two-K(m) model (K(m1) = 1.6 microM;  K(m2) = 195 microM). Based on the results of this study, we hypothesize that  EE2-Sul is taken up into renal proximal tubule cells by OAT3, and OAT4 plays a  role in its secretion into the renal brush border lumen.","2010-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1064-1071","","7","38","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20360303","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Animals; Substrate Specificity; Dogs; Insecta; Cell Line, Transformed; Kidney/*metabolism; Organic Cation Transporter 2; Transfection/methods; Biological Transport/*drug effects/genetics; Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Organic Anion Transport Protein 1/biosynthesis/genetics; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics; Organic Cation Transport Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about the effects of rifabutin, a related  rifamycin. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The relative effects of rifampin and rifabutin  on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ethinyl estradiol and  norethindrone were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded  crossover study in 12 premenopausal women who were on a stable oral contraceptive  regimen that contained 35 microg ethinyl estradiol/1 mg norethindrone. Subjects  were randomized to receive 14 days of rifampin or rifabutin from days 7 through  21 of their menstrual cycle. After a 1-month washout period (only the oral  contraceptives were taken), subjects were crossed over to the other rifamycin.  RESULTS: Rifampin significantly decreased the mean area under the plasma  concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] of ethinyl estradiol  and the mean AUC(0-24) of norethindrone. Rifabutin significantly decreased the  mean AUC(0-24) of ethinyl estradiol and the mean AUC(0-24) of norethindrone. The  effect of rifampin was significantly greater than rifabutin on each AUC(0-24).  Despite these changes, subjects did not ovulate (as determined by progesterone  concentrations) during the cycle in which either rifamycin was administered.  Levels of mean follicle-stimulating hormone increased 69% after rifampin.  CONCLUSION: In this study, rifampin (600 mg daily) was a more significant inducer  of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone clearance than rifabutin (300 mg daily),  but neither agent reversed the suppression of ovulation caused by oral  contraceptives. The carefully monitored oral contraceptive administration and the  limited exposure to rifamycins may restrict the application of this study to  clinical situations.","1999-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:25:07","","428-438","","4","65","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10223781","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Prospective Studies; Double-Blind Method; Hormones; Biology; Cross-Over Studies; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Physiology; United States; Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism; gamma-Glutamyltransferase/blood; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Luteinizing Hormone/blood; Developed Countries; Rifampin/*pharmacology; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; Treatment; Maryland; Antibiotics, Antitubercular/*pharmacology; *Drugs; *Research Report; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*pharmacokinetics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; *Norethindrone--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--pharmacodynamics; Endocrine System; Americas; North America; Northern America; *Oral Contraceptives; *Progesterone; Progestational Hormones; *Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Gonadotropins; Gonadotropins, Pituitary; Rifabutin/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Steroidal hormones have a profound role in thrombosis and haemostasis, although  adequate studies are not available to demonstrate their part in the  thromboembolic phenomena that occur at the blood-foreign material interface. We  studied the interfacial phenomena of five steroid hormonal drugs, Sustanon,  Menstrogen, Mixogen, Durabolin and Ovral and their interaction with proteins and  platelets toward an artificial surface using contact angle, polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis, trace labelling methods, etc. This study demonstrates the effect  of these hormones to modulate platelet-surface attachment in the presence of  platelet inducers. The addition of steroid hormones to the polymer-protein system  can inhibit the level of surface-bound albumin where the fibrinogen binding to an  artificial surface has been enhanced or unaltered. Steroids also increase  platelet-surface attachment to variable degrees. Prolonged use of steroids or the  oestrogen-containing oral contraceptive agents may not be advisable for patients  having an artificial implant in contact with blood.","1989-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","609-616","","9","10","","Biomaterials","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 2611310","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Cattle; Adsorption; Ethinyl Estradiol-Norgestrel Combination; Steroids/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Nandrolone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Norgestrel/pharmacology; *Dental Cements; *Polycarboxylate Cement; Blood Proteins/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/pharmacology; Drug Combinations/pharmacology; Ethisterone/pharmacology; Hormones/*pharmacology; Platelet Adhesiveness/*drug effects; Progesterone/pharmacology; Testosterone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 20 healthy  women aged 18-45 years received study treatments. In the lead-in period and in  period 1, participants received a full cycle of Ortho Tri-Cyclen (EE 35 μg with  NGM 0.18/0.215/0.25 mg) from days 1-28. In period 2, participants received a full  cycle of Ortho Tri-Cyclen LO (EE 25 μg with NGM 0.18/0.215/0.25 mg) plus ATV/RTV  (300/100 mg once daily) on days 29-42. PK assessments were performed on days 14  and 42 in periods 1 and 2, respectively. RESULTS: ATV/RTV with dose-normalized  EE/NGM resulted in geometric mean reductions of 16% in EE peak plasma  concentration (C(max)), 19% in EE area under the concentration-time curve for a  dosing interval (AUC([τ])) and 37% in EE lowest plasma concentration (C(min)),  compared with EE 35 μg with NGM in the absence of ATV/RTV. NGM with EE and  ATV/RTV 300/100 mg once daily resulted in increases of approximately 68%, 85% and  102% in 17-deacetyl NGM C(max), AUC((τ)) and C(min), respectively. Two  participants discontinued the study because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:  ATV/RTV with Ortho Tri-Cyclen was well-tolerated and reductions in EE were not  predicted to decrease contraceptive efficacy if the formulation contained ≥30 μg  of EE.","2011","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:42:26","","157-164","","2","16","","Antivir Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 21447864","","","","Adult; Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Atazanavir Sulfate; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Drug Combinations; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Pyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Ritonavir/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Women's Health; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The estrogenic  components of the oral contraceptives, mestranol or ethynylestradiol, have nearly  identical metabolic pathways since mestranol is rapidly and almost completely  converted to ethynylestradiol The major fraction of the drugs plus metabolites is  excreted in the urine as conjugated materials. All of the 17beta-ethynyl  progestins reviewed follow similar metabolic paths. For three of these,  norethynodrel, ethynodiol diacetate and lynestrenol, a principal metabolite is  norethindrone. Biotransformation to more polar metabolites and conjugation  proceed rapidly for these three precursor drugs and norethindrone. Norgestrel  follows metabolic paths similar to those of norethindrone. However, the ethyl  moiety at the C-13 position appears to slow the metabolism of this steroid so  that biotransformation to more polar metabolites and the conjugation of these  steroids does not proceed as rapidly as that of the other progestins. The high  progestational potency of norgestrel may be attributed to this slow rate of  biotransformation. Some of the pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the  research reports reviewed here are summarized. The compounds appear to be readily  absorbed, and they and their metabolites are excreted to a greater extent in the  urine than in the feces.","1977-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","139-166","","1-2","3","","J Toxicol Environ Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 411940","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Rats; Rabbits; Steroids/*metabolism; Haplorhini; Estradiol/metabolism; Norethindrone/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism; Norgestrel/metabolism; Contraceptives, Oral/*metabolism; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*metabolism; Mestranol/metabolism; Ethynodiol Diacetate/metabolism; Lynestrenol/metabolism; Norethynodrel/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subjects received a single dose of oral  contraceptive (30 microg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel) on each  of days 1 and 29.

Unfortunately, concerns about  increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk diminished its popularity.  Another version in Europe and Canada had slightly lower estrogen doses, but  questions were raised about its VTE risk too based on its progestin. To fill that  gap, two new contraceptive patches with lower estrogen levels have been developed  and extensively tested. AREAS COVERED: This article provides a short overview of  the first set of patches followed by discussions of the pharmacokinetics of the  two experimental patches as well as the results of their clinical trials,  including information about efficacy, bleeding patterns and tolerability. EXPERT  OPINION: Given the recent increased use of first tier contraceptive methods  (Intrauterine devices and implants), there may be interest in new patches. Price  will influence their popularity. However, a new nondaily delivery system with  lower estrogen levels will provide an important option to women.","2015-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","863-873","","6","16","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25800084","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Drug Combinations; Administration, Cutaneous; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptive Agents, Female/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Norpregnenes/administration & dosage/adverse effects; contraceptive patches; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/adverse effects; gestodene patch; levonorgestrel patch; Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/adverse effects; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives; transdermal contraceptive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Co-administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may  normalise androgen levels during COC use. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of  the addition of DHEA to a COC on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics  (PD) of DHEA and its sulphate (DHEA-S), and on levels of total and free  testosterone (T). METHODS: In a prospective, randomised, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, cross-over study involving 21 female volunteers, the PK and  PD of DHEA and DHEA-S were investigated during the use of one cycle of a COC  containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) with and  without daily co-administration of 50 mg DHEA. RESULTS: Treatment during one  cycle with a COC containing EE and DRSP reduces the exposure to DHEA and DHEA-S  by at least 20%. This loss of adrenal androgens can be fully compensated by daily  oral co-administration of 50 mg DHEA.

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from  nine women stabilized on VPA monotherapy on two separate randomized occasions:  (i) at the end of the 4- to 7-day HC-free interval, and (ii) on the last day of  the HC intake period. Trough concentrations of VPA in serum and serum  ultrafiltrates were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. RESULTS:  In all women, total and unbound VPA concentrations were higher during the HC-free  interval than during HC intake (means +/- SD: 425 +/- 184 vs. 350 +/- 145  micromol/L, respectively, for total VPA, p = 0.002, and 55 +/- 37 vs. 39 +/- 25  micromol/L, respectively, for unbound VPA, p = 0.005). Compared with the HC-free  interval, HC intake was associated with a mean 21.5% increase in VPA total  apparent oral clearance (from 8.0 +/- 5.2 to 9.7 +/- 6.4 ml/h/kg, p = 0.01) and a  45.2 % increase in VPA unbound apparent oral clearance (from 79 +/- 81 to 115 +/-  121 ml/h/kg, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: The apparent oral clearance of total and  unbound VPA increases during the HC intake period compared with the HC-free  interval, probably due to induction of glucuronosyltransferase by  ethinylestradiol. The magnitude of the change varies across individuals, being  potentially clinically relevant in some cases. Serum VPA concentrations should be  monitored when adding or discontinuing HC steroids, and possibly during the  on-off intervals of a HC cycle.","2006-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:29:36","","1569-1572","","9","47","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16981874","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Administration, Oral; Drug Interactions; Drug Monitoring; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay; Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Epilepsy/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism; Anticonvulsants/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Valproic Acid/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (5 mg/kg  per day s.c. for 5 days) or with 4-aminopyrazolo(3,4-d) pyrimidine (20 mg/kg per  day i.p. for 3 days). Both drug regimens suppressed plasma total and low density  lipoprotein-cholesterol by more than 80%. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of  low density lipoprotein transport did not show increased receptor activity in  extrahepatic tissues during either treatment. 17 alpha-Ethinyl estradiol  significantly increased low density lipoprotein tissue spaces and clearance rates  in the liver, with a 5-fold increase in low density lipoprotein-receptor  activity, whereas 4-aminopyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine suppressed hepatic transport  of low density lipoprotein probably due to a nospecific toxic effect. Treatment  with 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol markedly enhanced the hepatic expression of low  density lipoprotein-receptor protein and mRNA despite a 7-fold increase in  hepatic cholesteryl ester levels. Finally, treatment with both drugs increased  cholesterol synthesis in several extrahepatic tissues, such as adrenals, ovaries,  small bowel, and spleen. These findings confirm that 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol  at pharmacological doses markedly increases synthesis and expression of low  density lipoprotein-receptor in the liver. Hypocholesterolemia, whether induced  by activation of low density lipoprotein-receptors or by other mechanisms, fails  to up-regulate low density lipoprotein transport in extrahepatic tissues, which  rather respond by increasing local sterol synthesis. This suggests the occurrence  of separate regulatory mechanisms for low density lipoprotein transport and  cholesterol synthesis.","1996-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1812-1822","","8","37","","J Lipid Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8864965","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tissue Distribution; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Liver/drug effects/*metabolism; Anticholesteremic Agents/*pharmacology; Adrenal Glands/drug effects/metabolism; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacology; Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Cholesterol/biosynthesis/blood/*metabolism; Ovary/drug effects/metabolism; Receptors, LDL/drug effects/genetics/metabolism; Spleen/drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Thyroid and androgen parameters  were measured in 59 women treated with a monophasic combined oral contraceptive  containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 2 mg dienogest (EE/DNG) either  conventionally (13 cycles with 21 days of treatment+7 days without hormones) or  according to an extended-cycle regimen (four extended cycles with 84 days of  continuous administration of EE/DNG, followed by a hormone-free interval of 7  days). Blood samples were taken on Days 21-26 of the preceding control cycle and  on Days 19-21 of the 3rd and 13th conventional cycle, or on Days 82-84 of the  first and fourth extended cycle. RESULTS: At both time points, the serum  concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin were elevated by about 65% in both  treatment regimens. Likewise, both groups showed an increase in total  triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxine (T4) by 30-40%, and no change in free  T4. Until the 12th month of conventional treatment, the level of free T3 remained  unchanged but decreased slightly during the extended-cycle regimen. In both  groups there was a rise of sex hormone-binding globulin by 210-230% after 3  months and by 220-250% after 12 months. The levels of total testosterone were  reduced by about 40% and those of free testosterone by 55-65% after 3 and 12  months. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, during conventional and  extended-cycle treatment with EE/DNG, a steady state in the effects on thyroid  hormones and androgen parameters was reached within 3 months and that the changes  in the various hormonal parameters did not substantially differ between  conventional and extended-cycle regimen.","2008-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","420-425","","6","77","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18477491","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Prospective Studies; Drug Administration Schedule; Testosterone/blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Nandrolone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Estrogens/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Androgens/*metabolism; Thyroid Hormones/*metabolism; Thyroxine-Binding Proteins/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also provides (3) a  comparison of CPA and spironolactone regarding the tentative benefits and risks  and offers (4) general rules for the drug treatment of androgenized women.  Clinical results indicate that those agents are most effective which not only  competitively inhibit androgen binding at the receptor level but also suppress  androgen secretion and/or production. The combined mode of action is observed  with CPA as well as spironolactone. Pharmacokinetic studies underline the  necessity to restrict CPA administration in huge doses to the first half of a  treatment cycle in order to avoid bleeding disturbances. Also it appears that  individual differences in CPA bioavailability do not satisfactorily explain the  lack of therapeutic response in about 30% of the cases. Data are presented  hinting that the 15 beta-hydroxy-, metabolite of CPA may actually be the  biologically active agent. In addition preliminary results are given indicating  that intramuscular CPA is therapeutically more effective than oral CPA.","1983-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","591-597","","1B","19","","J Steroid Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 6224974","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Structure-Activity Relationship; Drug Combinations; Testosterone/blood; Acne Vulgaris/*drug therapy; Cyproterone Acetate; Ethinyl Estradiol/therapeutic use; Progestins/therapeutic use; Androgen Antagonists/*therapeutic use; Cyproterone/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Hirsutism/*drug therapy; Spironolactone/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore we evaluated the effect of St John's wort on the disposition and  efficacy of Ortho-Novum 1/35 (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc, Raritan, NJ), a  popular combination oral contraceptive pill containing ethinyl estradiol (INN,  ethinylestradiol) and norethindrone (INN, norethisterone). METHODS: Twelve  healthy premenopausal women who were using oral contraception (>3 months)  received a combination oral contraceptive pill (Ortho-Novum 1/35) for 3  consecutive 28-day menstrual cycles. During the second and third cycles, the  participants received 300 mg St John's wort 3 times a day. The serum  concentrations of ethinyl estradiol (day 7), norethindrone (day 7),  follicle-stimulating hormone (days 12-16), luteinizing hormone (days 12-16),  progesterone (day 21), and intravenous and oral midazolam (days 22 and 23) were  determined in serial blood samples. The incidence of breakthrough bleeding was  quantified during the first and third cycles. RESULTS: Concomitant use of St  John's wort was associated with a significant (P <.05) increase in the oral  clearance of norethindrone (8.2 +/- 2.7 L/h to 9.5 +/- 3.4 L/h, P =.042) and a  significant reduction in the half-life of ethinyl estradiol (23.4 +/- 19.5 hours  to 12.2 +/- 7.1 hours, P =.023). The oral clearance of midazolam was  significantly increased (109.2 +/- 47.9 L/h to 166.7 +/- 81.3 L/h, P =.007)  during St John's wort administration, but the systemic clearance of midazolam was  unchanged (37.7 +/- 11.3 L/h to 39.0 +/- 10.3 L/h, P =.567). Serum concentrations  of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and progesterone were not  significantly affected by St John's wort dosing (P >.05). Breakthrough bleeding  occurred in 2 of 12 women in the control phase compared with 7 of 12 women in the  St John's wort phase. The oral clearance of midazolam after St John's wort dosing  was greater in women who had breakthrough bleeding (215.9 +/- 66.5 L/h) than in  those who did not (97.5 +/- 37.2 L/h) (P =.005). CONCLUSION: St John's wort  causes an induction of ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone metabolism consistent with  increased CYP3A activity. Women taking oral contraceptive pills should be  counseled to expect breakthrough bleeding and should consider adding a barrier  method of contraception when consuming St Johns wort.","2003-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:29","","525-535","","6","74","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14663455","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Administration, Oral; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Injections, Intravenous; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Drug Combinations; Midazolam/*pharmacokinetics; *Hypericum; Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood; Enzyme Induction/*drug effects; Hypnotics and Sedatives/*pharmacokinetics; Menstrual Cycle/drug effects; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*biosynthesis/metabolism; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Mestranol/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/*biosynthesis/metabolism; Plant Preparations/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contaminants can bind  to DOM and this may alter the bioavailability and subsequent toxicity of the  contaminants. However, molecular-level techniques are needed to more closely  evaluate the impact of DOM on the sub-lethal biochemical responses to emerging  contaminants. To investigate how DOM may alter the metabolic response to organic  contaminant exposure, (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics  was used to investigate how the metabolome of Daphnia magna changes when Suwannee  River DOM (5 mg organic carbon/L) is included in the acute exposure of four  contaminants with varying hydrophobicity. Sub-lethal concentrations of the  hydrophobic contaminant 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), the relatively more polar  compounds carbamazepine and imidacloprid, or the anionic contaminant  perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were used. A 48-h exposure to DOM alone had a  minor impact on the metabolome of D. magna. There were significant increases in  amino acids from EE2 exposure which were reduced in the presence of DOM,  suggesting that DOM may alleviate the sub-lethal metabolic response from EE2  exposure through sorption and a reduction in freely dissolved EE2. The metabolome  was relatively unaltered with exposure to carbamazepine and imidacloprid in the  presence of DOM which is likely because these contaminants are water soluble and  did not strongly interact with DOM. PFOS exposure resulted in a more significant  metabolic response with DOM suggesting that DOM enhanced the uptake and  bioavailability of PFOS in D. magna. As such, the presence of DOM should be  considered when determining sensitive molecular-level changes in organisms to  sub-lethal organic contaminant exposure.","2018-11-30","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","189-200","","","164","","Ecotoxicol Environ Saf","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The detection of glucuronides at low micromolar concentrations is  required to accurately model in vitro enzyme kinetics and in vivo  pharmacokinetics. However, relatively few glucuronides are currently available as  standards for developing liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC/MS)  bioanalytical methods. METHODS: The glucuronidation capacity of hepatic  microsomes prepared from rat (RLM), dog (DLM), monkey (MLM), and human (HLM) was  examined for five xenobiotic substrates. In each case, glucuronide standards were  produced using the enzyme source most efficient for the production of that  specific glucuronide. RESULTS: Dog hepatic microsomes were used to produce  glucuronides for anthraflavic acid (yield: 14 mg), buprenorphine (yield: 14 mg),  and octylgallate (total yield: 13 mg), whereas propofol glucuronide (yield: 20  mg), and ethinylestradiol glucuronide (yield: 8 mg) were prepared using HLM. All  glucuronides were characterized by LC/MS/MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy. DISCUSSION: The multimilligram quantities of glucuronide standards  produced by this method have many applications throughout drug discovery and  toxicology. In addition to allowing the quantification of glucuronide formation  from in vitro and in vivo studies, the authentic standards produced could also be  used to assess potential pharmacological or toxicological effects of metabolites.","2002-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","161-168","","3","47","","J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12628307","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Dogs; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Haplorhini; Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism; Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism; Xenobiotics/*metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism; *Reference Standards; Anthraquinones/metabolism; Buprenorphine/metabolism; Gallic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Glucuronides/analysis/*biosynthesis; Propofol/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mean basal plasma testosterone was 70 plus or minus 30 ng/dl, significantly (P  less than 0.01) higher than the mean of twenty-three normal women; basal  metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of testosterone was also higher (P less than 0.01)  than that reported for normal women.

After 4 months, small dose betamethasone  therapy (0.5 mg at bed time) had reduced the mean PR of testosterone in thirteen  patients from 509 mug/24 h to 356 mug/24 h (P = 0.05); anovulatory steroids  reduced mean PR of testosterone in nine from 612 mug/24 h to 345 mug/24 h (P less  than 0.05, greater than 0.025), and the combination of both therapies in ten  reduced PR of testosterone from 528 mug/24 h to 148 mug/24 h (P less than 0.001).  The latter regimen had moderate success in reducing hair growth (in six out of  ten). Fourteen of the twenty-five claimed benefit in hirsutism and all thirteen  with acne were improved.

Ligand blottings on liver membranes showed that purified HDL1, containing  about 70% apolipoprotein E and 10% apolipoprotein AI, bind to the LDL receptor  (130 kDa) and not to HB2 (100 kDa) or SR-BI (82 kDa), candidate HDL receptors.  Immunoblots showed that the treatment increased the hepatic level of the LDL  receptor five- to ten-fold, strongly decreased that of SRBI and did not change  that of HB2. An in vivo kinetic study showed that the turnover of HDL1  cholesteryl ester is more rapid in treated than control rats. The liver  participation (60%) in this clearance was not modified by the treatment.  Therefore, it can be concluded that the catabolism of HDL1 cholesteryl ester, in  control as in treated rats, is essentially ensured by the uptake of entire  particles in the hepatocytes via LDL receptors.","1999-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","591-596","","7","322","","C R Acad Sci III","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 10488433","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Rats, Wistar; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Cholesterol/metabolism; Liver/drug effects/*metabolism; Apolipoproteins E/metabolism; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Adrenal Glands/drug effects/metabolism; Spleen/drug effects/metabolism; *Carrier Proteins; *Lipoproteins, HDL; *RNA-Binding Proteins; Apolipoproteins A/metabolism; Cholesterol, HDL/drug effects/isolation & purification/*metabolism; Receptors, LDL/metabolism; Receptors, Lipoprotein/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty micrograms of EE coupled with levonorgestrel  results in fewer side effects and cycle control comparable with higher-dose  pills. Differences between therapeutically equivalent and brand-name, low-dose  oral contraceptives, with respect to the bioavailability of hormones, may  interfere with contraceptive efficacy and increase breakthrough bleeding. One of  the most common reasons why women discontinue OCs is increased breakthrough  bleeding. Because after OC discontinuation most women switch to a less-effective  method, or no method, of contraception, an increase in breakthrough bleeding  could ultimately result in an increase in unintended pregnancy. Thus,  substituting a therapeutically equivalent for a brand-name low-dose oral  contraceptive may have significant clinical and economic effects on individual  and public health.","2000-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","285-288","","6","62","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11239614","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Pregnancy; Therapeutic Equivalency; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Drugs, Generic/administration & dosage/adverse effects; Estradiol Congeners/administration & dosage; Pregnancy, Unwanted; Progesterone Congeners/administration & dosage/adverse effects; Uterine Hemorrhage/chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also important, given the  clinical interest, to evaluate the molecular effects of estrogen  agonists/antagonists such as tamoxifen and droloxifene in reproductive tissues.  In this report, our goal was to identify estrogen regulated genes in the uterus  and to compare the regulation by estrogen and tamoxifen with that of droloxifene.  A subtractive cDNA library strategy was developed to identify estrogen-regulated  genes in the uteri of ovariectomized rats 4 h after treatment with  17-alpha-ethynyl estradiol (30 microg/kg). The mRNAs encoding 8 genes were  confirmed by Northern blot analysis to be induced at early times following  estrogen administration. Calcium binding protein 9 kDa and complement protein 3  are well characterized estrogen regulated genes that were identified in the  library and served as markers for estrogen action. In addition, mRNAs encoding  the interleukin 4 receptor, heat-shock protein 70 kDa, metallothionein, tumor  necrosis factor regulated gene 6, inositol-1-monophosphate synthase, and cyr-61  were induced in the uterus by estrogen. The identified mRNAs were then examined  for regulation by droloxifene (1 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) and tamoxifen (10 mg/kg,  p.o.). Both droloxifene and tamoxifen induced mRNA levels for all of these genes.  However, clear quantitative and temporal differences were observed when comparing  estrogen versus droloxifene versus tamoxifen. For example, estrogen induced IL4  receptor mRNA to a greater degree than did tamoxifen or droloxifene. Conversely,  tamoxifen resulted in a much greater induction of cyr61 than did either estrogen  or droloxifene. Droloxifene at 1 mg/kg, an efficacious dose for prevention of  bone loss in this model, did not or only slightly induced the mRNA for all of the  genes examined with the exception of cyr61. In conclusion, the modified  subtractive library method used in this study proved to be efficient in the  identification of estrogen-regulated genes in the uterus. The identities of the  regulated genes were consistent with the concept that estrogen functions to prime  uterine tissue for increased responsivity to extracellular signals such as growth  factors and cytokines. Elucidating the physiological role of these newly  identified estrogen responsive genes and the mechanisms responsible for the  different responses to droloxifene versus estrogen and tamoxifen may be important  in enhancing our understanding of tissue selective estrogen agonists/antagonists.","1998-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","13-24","","1-2","64","","J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9569006","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Tissue Distribution; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; DNA, Complementary/genetics; Ovariectomy; Ovary/metabolism; Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology; Myo-Inositol-1-Phosphate Synthase/genetics; Tamoxifen/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Uterus/*drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, a single exposure study was performed  with a 50 days latency period on adult worms of Nereis succinea. Since reduced  glutathione (GSH) is required in detoxification of NP and is the precursor of the  spawning pheromone nereithione (CSSG) in N. succinea, we analysed how the  estrogenic chemical NP affects GSH concentrations. PGC were not affected by  exposure to E(2) and EE(2) from 24hpf to 6 days. Chronic exposure of P. dumerilii  with NP over the full life cycle did not influence segment proliferation.

A significant decline of GSH can be seen in N. succinea males upon  treatment with NP, but not in females, indicating that females stabilize GSH  levels even in stress situations.

We hypothesized that out-of-range concentrations reflect nonadherent ring use and  predict ovulation risk. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a secondary analysis of data  from a prospective, multi-centered, randomized, Phase IIa dose-finding trial for  a CVR releasing NES and E2. Our primary outcome was the risk of ovulation  associated with out-of-range NES events. We calculated the 5th and 95th  percentile NES concentrations of subjects at steady state to determine high and  low cutoffs. We used a Fisher's exact test to determine group differences, and  calculated the relative risk of ovulation for each group. RESULTS: We analyzed  available serum NES data from cycles 2 (n = 172), 3 (n = 156) and 7 (n = 115) to  determine the 5th and 95th percentile of all NES concentrations (64, 296 pg/mL).  In the 443 cycles of observation, no ovulations occurred in participants with NES  concentrations within the expected range. In contrast, we found ovulatory  elevations of progesterone in 21 cycles with out-of-range values. Of these, 15  (71%) cycles had evidence of one or more nonadherent low and 6 (29%) one or more  unexpected peak. The relative risk of ovulation increased with evidence of  multiple non-adherent levels. CONCLUSIONS: We found out-of-range NES  concentrations, suggestive of improper use of a CVR associated with an increased  risk of ovulation, with a direct relationship between the number of out-of-range  events and the relative risk. IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study support the  use of out-of-range serum NES values as a marker of adherence in contraceptive  clinical trials of continuous vaginal rings, and suggest that nonadherence occurs  even in early phase clinical trials with close monitoring.","2022-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","61-64","","","108","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The  present study was designed to test the hypothesis that estrogens lower plasma  levels of t-PA by increasing its clearance from the bloodstream. 17alpha-Ethinyl  estradiol (EE) treatment resulted in a significant increase in the clearance rate  of recombinant human t-PA in mice (0.46 mL/min in treated mice v 0. 32 mL/min in  controls; P <.01). The clearance of endogenous, bradykinin-released t-PA in rats  was also significantly increased after EE treatment (area under the curve [AUC],  24.9 ng/mL. min in treated animals v 31.9 ng/mL. min in controls; P <.05). Two  distinct t-PA clearance systems exist in vivo: the low-density lipoprotein  receptor-related protein (LRP) on liver parenchymal cells and the mannose  receptor on mainly liver endothelial cells. Inhibition of LRP by intravenous  injection of receptor-associated protein (RAP) as a recombinant fusion protein  with Salmonella japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) significantly retarded  t-PA clearance in control mice (from 0.41 to 0.25 mL/min; n = 5, P <.001) and  EE-treated mice (from 0.66 to 0.35 mL/min; n = 5, P <.005), but did not eliminate  the difference in clearance capacity between the 2 experimental groups. Similar  results were obtained in mice in which LRP was inhibited via overexpression of  the RAP gene in liver by adenoviral gene transduction. In contrast,  administration of mannan, a mannose receptor antagonist, resulted in identical  clearances (0.22 mL/min in controls and 0.24 mL/min in EE-treated mice). Northern  blot analysis showed a 6-fold increase in mannose receptor mRNA expression in the  nonparenchymal liver cells of EE-treated mice, whereas the parenchymal LRP mRNA  levels remained unchanged. These findings were confirmed at the protein level by  ligand blotting and Western blotting analysis. Our results demonstrate that EE  treatment results in increased plasma clearance rate of t-PA via induction of the  mannose receptor and could explain for the inverse relationship between estrogen  status and plasma t-PA concentrations as observed in humans.","1999-08-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:22","","1330-1336","","4","94","","Blood","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10438721","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Mice; Liver/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism; Mannose Receptor; *Fibrinolysis; Recombinant Proteins/blood/pharmacokinetics; Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacology; *Lectins, C-Type; *Mannose-Binding Lectins; Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This triphasic oral  contraceptive may have a clinically significant effect on the activity of some  drug-metabolizing enzymes.","2005-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1413-1421","","12","45","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16291717","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Cross-Over Studies; Genotype; Drug Combinations; Therapeutic Equivalency; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*metabolism; Caffeine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Dextromethorphan/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Midazolam/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Omeprazole/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*metabolism; Vitamin K/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Warfarin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Xanthine Oxidase/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Norgestrel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  Phase I clinical study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and  tolerability of coadministration of EZG and a combined oral contraceptive (OC).  METHODS: An open-label drug-interaction study was conducted in healthy, female  volunteers aged 18 - 55 years with regular menstrual cycles. The effects of  steady-state 750 mg EZG on the PK of a combined OC agent containing 1 mg  norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol were evaluated, along with the  effect of the contraceptive hormones on EZG PK. Safety was evaluated by clinical  laboratory, vital sign, electrocardiogram, physical examination, and adverse  event (AE) assessments. RESULTS: Of 30 enrolled volunteers, 25 completed all  treatments. OC did not affect the PK of EZG. EZG increased norethindrone area  under the concentration-time curve (AUC) by 28%, with no change in the maximum  plasma concentration (Cmax). Ethinyl estradiol Cmax was 21% lower with no change  in AUC. The majority of AEs were mild in severity, with the most commonly  reported being gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders. No deaths  or serious AEs were reported in this study. Five volunteers discontinued  treatment due to AEs. CONCLUSIONS: EZG did not have any clinically relevant  impact on exposure of OC hormones in this study, and the OC hormones did not  alter EZG PK parameters. This study provides PK evidence that doses of EZG and  OCs do not need to be altered when co-administered.","2013-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:27:11","","847-853","","11","51","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 24040852","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Young Adult; Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Carbamates/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Phenylenediamines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the effects of tamoxifen (TAMOX) and the  synthetic estrogen 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE) on estrogen-dependent gene  expression and receptor binding in the female rat brain. Both immediate and  residual effects were examined in both the presence and absence of  17beta-estradiol. Two groups of adult, ovariectomized, female rats (n=30 per  group) were injected with TAMOX (5 mg/kg), EE (0.1 mg/kg), or sesame oil daily  for 14 days. Animals from the first group were implanted with blank or  17beta-estradiol Silastic capsules concurrently with the last three SERM  injections (immediate, group 1). Animals from the second group received either  blank or 17beta-estradiol implants 2 weeks after the last injection (residual,  group 2). All animals were sacrificed 72 h after implantation. TAMOX increased  uterine weight in the absence of estrogen, but inhibited uterine weight gain in  the presence of estrogen in both groups 1 and 2. TAMOX and EE increased oxytocin  receptor binding in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) in the  absence of estrogen in both groups 1 and 2. The estrogen-dependent induction of  PR mRNA expression in the VMN was significantly attenuated by TAMOX in group 1.  Finally, TAMOX and EE had opposite effects on ERbeta mRNA expression in the  paraventricular nucleus in the absence of 17beta-estradiol in group 1. Neither  had any effect in group 2 when 17beta-estradiol was present. These results  suggest that TAMOX has mixed agonist/antagonist effects in the female rat brain,  many of which persist at least 2 weeks after the administration ceases.","2003-07-18","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","185-193","","1-2","978","","Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 12834913","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Time Factors; Autoradiography; Binding Sites; RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; Organ Size/drug effects; In Situ Hybridization; Drug Administration Schedule/veterinary; Ethinyl Estradiol/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Estradiol Congeners/adverse effects/pharmacology; Estrogen Antagonists/adverse effects/pharmacology; Fallopian Tubes/drug effects; Hypothalamus/*drug effects/metabolism; Receptors, Oxytocin/genetics/metabolism; Receptors, Progesterone/genetics/metabolism; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods; Tamoxifen/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Vasotocin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the prevalence pattern of overactive bladder and the widespread use of oral  contraception, circumstances are likely to arise in which physicians may wish to  prescribe tolterodine for patients already taking oral contraceptives. Based on a  search of MEDLINE from 1990 to 2001, there have been no studies of whether  concomitant use of these agents entails a risk of drug-drug interaction or  conception. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of tolterodine on the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a low-dose combination oral  contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 microg/levonorgestrel 150 microg). METHODS:  This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study in healthy women.  Oral contraception was given for 21 days either alone or in combination with oral  tolterodine 2 mg BID (on days 1-14) over two 28-day contraceptive cycles.  Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on day 14 based on plasma levels of  ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel up to 24 hours after dosing and serum  tolterodine levels at 1 to 3 hours after dosing. The potential for  pharmacodynamic interaction was assessed in terms of the risk of failure of  suppression of ovulation based on serum levels of estradiol and progesterone  measured throughout each cycle. RESULTS: Twenty-four healthy women (age, 23-41  years [mean, 30 years]; height, 155-178 cm [mean, 167 cm]; body weight, 51-75 kg  [mean, 64 kg]) participated in the study. There was no evidence of a  pharmacokinetic interaction between tolterodine and the steroid hormones in the  oral contraceptive used, nor did the oral contraceptive show any relevant  pharmacokinetic interaction with tolterodine. Serum levels of estradiol and  progesterone indicated suppression of ovulation in both treatment periods.  CONCLUSION: In this selected population. coadministration of tolterodine did not  affect the contraceptive efficacy of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive  containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.","2001-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:21","","1876-1888","","11","23","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11768839","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Cross-Over Studies; Estradiol/blood; Progesterone/blood; Tolterodine Tartrate; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Levonorgestrel/*pharmacokinetics; Progesterone Congeners/*pharmacokinetics; Ovulation/drug effects; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacokinetics; *Phenylpropanolamine; Benzhydryl Compounds/*adverse effects/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Cresols/*adverse effects/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Muscarinic Antagonists/*adverse effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much  is now known about the human P450 enzymes and what they do, and it has been  possible to apply this information to issues related to practical problems. A  relatively small subset of the total number of human P450s appears to be  responsible for a large fraction of the oxidation of drugs. The three major  reasons for drug-drug interactions involving the P450s are induction, inhibition,  and possibly stimulation, with inhibition appearing to be the most important in  terms of known clinical problems. With the available knowledge of human P450s and  reagents, it is possible to do in vitro experiments with drugs and make useful  predictions. The results can be tested in vivo, again using assays based on our  knowledge of human P450s. This approach has the capability of not only improving  predictions about which drugs might show serious interaction problems, but also  decreasing the number of in vivo interaction studies that must be performed.  These approaches should improve with further refinement and technical advances.","1997","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","7-35","","","43","","Adv Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9342171","","","","Humans; Animals; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Beverages; Binding Sites; Food-Drug Interactions; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism; *Drug Interactions; *Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism; Citrus; Ethinyl Estradiol/metabolism; Cimetidine/metabolism; Terfenadine/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These components interact with different cell surface  receptors to modulate the transduction of signals for cell growth,  differentiation, migration, proliferation and apoptosis. Previous findings in the  teleost fish gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L., Teleostei), a marine  protandrous hermaphrodite fish, showed that endocrine and immune stimuli are able  to modulate the expression of ECM-related molecules, as well as specific  correlations between them. In the present study, quantitative reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the gene expression  profile of β(1) integrin isoform b (ITGB1b) and its possible role in reproductive  physiology, especially in relation to spermatogenesis. Expression profiles were  analysed in the context of the reproductive cycle (RC) and in relation with other  ECM-related molecules, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, MMP-13,  tissue-specific inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2a, TIMP-2b, collagen  (COL1A1) and ITGB1a. Expression of ITGB1b was found in the testis and brain and,  to some extent, in endothelial cells. In contrast, ITGB1a was expressed  ubiquitously. In the testis, the ITGB1b expression peaked during spermatogenesis,  whereas the expression of the other ECM-related molecules is induced mainly  during the post-spawning stage, both stages of marked tissue remodelling during  the first and second RC in males. In addition, in fish exposed to the endocrine  disruptor 17α-ethynyloestradiol (at 5 and 50 μg g(-1) food during 7, 14 and 21  days), ITGB1b expression in the testis was inhibited in a dose- and  time-dependent manner and was related to reduced serum levels of testosterone.  Together, these results suggest a different functionality for the two ITGB1  isoforms in the gilthead seabream, where ITGB1b is more specifically involved in  reproduction. This is the first report of an ITGB1 gene isoform whose expression  is restricted to endocrine-related tissues in vertebrates.","2011","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","654-664","","5","23","","Reprod Fertil Dev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 21635814","","","","Male; Female; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Age Factors; Tissue Distribution; Testosterone/blood; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Endocrine Disruptors/pharmacology; Fish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Integrin beta1/genetics/*metabolism; Sea Bream/embryology/genetics/*metabolism; Spermatogenesis; Testis/drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: In a prospective, randomized injection  frequency-response study, the effect of GH treatment in combination with low dose  ethinyl oestradiol on CH metabolism was evaluated, comparing twice daily (BID)  with once daily (OD) injections of a total GH dose of 6 U/m2/day until adult  height was reached. PATIENTS: Nineteen untreated girls with TS, mean (SD)  pretreatment age 13.3 (1.7) (range 11.0-17.6) year. MEASUREMENTS: Glucose and  insulin concentrations during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were measured  before and during GH treatment, as well as at 6 months after discontinuation of  GH treatment. RESULTS: GH treatment was discontinued after a mean of 43 (range  27-57) months. In one of the 19 girls, a different girl at each time point  before, during and after discontinuation of GH treatment, the glucose response to  OGTT after 120 minutes was above 7.8 mmol/l but below 11.1 mmol/l, indicating  impaired glucose tolerance. None of the girls developed diabetes mellitus.  Fasting glucose levels did not significantly change during, or after  discontinuation of GH treatment. The 3 h area under the curve for  time-concentration adjusted for fasting levels during the OGTT for glucose showed  a significant decrease during GH treatment. In contrast to the glucose levels, GH  treatment induced considerably higher insulin levels compared to pretreatment  values. After discontinuation of GH insulin levels decreased to values comparable  with pretreatment levels. None of these observed changes were different between  the GH injection frequency groups. The changes in CH variables during and after  discontinuation of GH were not related to changes in body mass index.  CONCLUSIONS: GH treatment with 6 U/m2/day in combination with low dose ethinyl  oestradiol in girls with Turner syndrome aged > or =11 years did not negatively  influence glucose levels, but induced higher levels of insulin indicating  relative insulin resistance. These changes in insulin levels were independent of  the frequency of the GH injections (once vs. twice daily). After discontinuation  of GH treatment, insulin values decreased to baseline levels.","2000-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","741-747","","6","52","","Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10848879","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Prospective Studies; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Injections, Intravenous; Drug Administration Schedule; Child; Drug Therapy, Combination; Body Mass Index; Blood Glucose/*analysis; Insulin/*blood; Ethinyl Estradiol/*therapeutic use; Growth Disorders/*drug therapy/metabolism; Growth Hormone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Turner Syndrome/complications/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present  study was designed to investigate the estrogenic potency based on anti-AhR  signalling effect of three 4-OH substituted PCB congeners (#107, #146 and #187),  one 3-OH substituted congener (#138), and the pharmaceutical synthetic estrogen,  ethynylestradiol (EE2) in fish in vitro system using primary culture of Atlantic  salmon hepatocytes. The effects were studied by quantifying changes in  transcripts with gene-sequence primer pairs for a suite of gene responses  (AhRalpha, ARNT, CYP1A1, CYP3A, UGT and GST) belonging to the xenobiotic  biotransformation system. Our data show that OH-PCB congeners and EE2, decreased  AhRalpha and ARNT transcript levels, and CYP1A1, UGT and GST gene expressions,  together with CYP3A gene expression. The decreased expression of transcripts for  xenobiotic biotransformation system is related to the concentration of individual  OH-PCB congener and these responses are typical of reported estrogenic and  estrogen-like effects on the CYP system. Modulation of biotransformation pathways  by OH-PCBs may alter xenobiotic metabolism leading to the production of toxic  reactive molecules, altering pharmacokinetics and diminishing the clearance rate  of individual chemicals from the organism.","2007-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","351-360","","3","68","","Ecotoxicol Environ Saf","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 17207528","","","","Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Cells, Cultured; Hydroxylation; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects; Signal Transduction/drug effects; Glutathione Transferase/metabolism; Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism; Biotransformation/drug effects/genetics; Xenobiotics/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/metabolism/*toxicity; Estrogens/metabolism/*toxicity; Ethinyl Estradiol/toxicity; Salmo salar/*metabolism; Fish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator; Hepatocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/metabolism/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blood samples for analysis were taken during a pretreatment cycle, the  first and 6th treatment cycles and post-treatment. Minor changes in carbohydrate  metabolism occurred and these were particularly noticeable when the incremental  areas under the serum concentration-time curves for both glucose and insulin in  response to a glucose tolerance test were calculated. No changes occurred in the  serum glycosylated haemoglobin levels. The serum concentrations of all the lipids  measured (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C and apolipoproteins AI,  AII and B) were significantly increased on treatment as were levels of Factor X,  SHBG and caeruloplasmin whereas antithrombin III decreased. In 38 of the 40  treatment cycles, ovulation was suppressed. In one cycle serum oestradiol and  progesterone levels showed a typical ovulatory pattern and in another there was  evidence of follicular activity without ovulation. Serum EE concentrations showed  a similar pattern in both treatment cycles showing that co-administration of NET  did not affect EE metabolism. Serum NET levels were higher in the 6th than in the  first treatment cycles. On comparing pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic  parameters, the only statistically significant correlations were between the  percentage change in triglycerides and SHBG and serum NET, but not EE  concentrations, and between apolipoproteins AI and serum EE.","1990-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:47","","439-453","","4","42","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2257742","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Biology; China; Estradiol/blood; Progesterone/blood; Physiology; Asia; Insulin/blood; Cholesterol/blood; Glucose/metabolism; Apolipoproteins/blood; Developing Countries; Contraception; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Estrogens; Metabolic Effects; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptive Methods--pharmacodynamics; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Endocrine System; *Steroid Metabolic Effects; *Oral Contraceptives--pharmacodynamics; *Glucose Metabolism Effects; *Method Acceptability; Contraceptive Usage; Progestational Hormones; *Carbohydrate Metabolic Effects; *Hormones--analysis; Eastern Asia; *Estradiol--analysis; *Progesterone--analysis; Antithrombin III/chemistry; Ceruloplasmin/chemistry; Factor X/chemistry; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once  formed, the 3-O-sulfate conjugate (EE2-Sul) is detected in circulation at  appreciable levels (versus parent EE2) and is present in bile. Therefore, hepatic  uptake of EE2-Sul was assessed with suspensions of cryopreserved human primary  hepatocytes. In this instance, there was evidence for active  (temperature-dependent) uptake, which was described by a two-K(m) (Michaelis  constant) model (K(m1) = 220 nM; K(m2) = 15.5 microM). Uptake was inhibited  (approximately 90%) by bromosulfophthalein but not by tetraethylammonium or  p-aminohippurate. In agreement, EE2-Sul was shown to be a substrate of  recombinant organic anion transporter peptides (OATP1B1 and OATP2B1), and  Na(+)/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), expressed individually in  human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Transport by OATP1B1 was described by two  K(m) values (87 nM and 141 microM), whereas OATP2B1- and NTCP-mediated uptake  into HEK-293 cells conformed to single K(m) kinetics (10.7 and 2.6 microM,  respectively). EE2-Sul was also assessed as an efflux transporter substrate using  membrane vesicles expressing bile salt export pump, breast cancer resistance  protein (BCRP), and individual forms of multidrug resistance-associated protein  (MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3). Transport studies were also conducted with a cell line  expression P-glycoprotein. Only vesicles that contained BCRP exhibited  ATP-dependent uptake of EE2-Sul (K(m1) = 2.9 and K(m2) = 307 microM).  Collectively, the data show that hepatic uptake of EE2-Sul can be mediated by  three transporters (OATP1B1, OATP2B1, and NTCP), whereas biliary excretion of  EE2-Sul into bile likely involves BCRP.","2010-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1072-1082","","7","38","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20360302","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; Cell Line, Transformed; Liver/metabolism; Hepatocytes/*metabolism; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 11; Organic Anion Transporters/biosynthesis/genetics; Transfection/methods; Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/genetics; Biological Transport, Active/*drug effects/genetics; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Dependent/biosynthesis/genetics; Symporters/biosynthesis/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of these 14 genes, mRNA expression  of a novel gene, termed ovary structure protein 1 (OSP1) in the present study,  showed female-like expression pattern with the highest transcription levels, and  displayed the most significantly positive correlation with the severity index of  intersex (r(2) =0.8215, p<0.0001). The full-length mRNA sequence of OSP1 is 802  bp, with an open reading frame (ORF) of 642 bp that encodes a 214-amino acid  peptide. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ  hybridization revealed that OSP1 was expressed exclusively in the ovaries,  specifically in the oogonia and primary oocytes in ovaries and in testis with  intersex.

The  protocol consisted of: i) adult male goldfish in late gonadal recrudescence  exposed to 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2); ii) adult male and female goldfish in  early sexual regression exposed to 1 nM E2 for 3, 6, 12 and 24h; and, iii)  sexually mature, adult male goldfish exposed to 0.3 nM 17alpha-ethynylestradiol  (EE2) for 24h. Liver produced the most consistent response with up-regulation of  ERalpha in sexually regressed, mature and recrudescing males and in sexually  regressed females. The dose and length of exposure, reproductive state and sex  affected the auto-regulation of ERbeta1 by E2. ERbeta2 was not affected in any  experiments suggesting it may not be auto-regulated by E2. Aromatase B and VTG  gene expression were affected by E2, but also by other experimental conditions.  EE2 induced liver ERalpha and VTG mRNA levels indicating that high environmental  EE2 levels induce E2-mediated gene expression in a model teleost.

In vitro, the  ATRA emulsion was proved binding to apolipoprotein(s). In vivo, the clearance of  ATRA was significantly reduced by formulating into the tributyrin emulsion,  leading to higher AUCs. Co-administration with 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, a  compound known to upregulate the activity of low-density lipoprotein receptors in  tissues, significantly increased the K(e), V, and CL of ATRA. The variation of  plasma AUCs after administering the ATRA emulsion to the healthy rats was two  times less than that after the ATRA solution. The IC(50) in ATRA of the ATRA  emulsion for the Caco-2 carcinoma cells was 3.8 microg/mL lower than 6 microg/mL  of the ATRA solution. The IC(50) of the emulsion for the HepG2 carcinoma cells  was 2.8 microg/mL, while IC(50) was not achieved with the ATRA solution over the  test concentration range.

Several in vivo approaches were used to determine the efficacy and sites  of action of this compound in rats. CI-976 decreased non-high density lipoprotein  (HDL)-cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol in rats with pre-established  dyslipidemia. High performance gel chromatographic separation of plasma  lipoproteins also revealed that CI-976, but not CL 277,082, lowered low density  lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and elevated HDL-cholesterol. Bay o 2752,  octimibate, melinamide, and SaH 58-035 were all less potent in vivo compared to  CI-976 and CL 277,082, and CI-976 produced the greatest decrease in liver  cholesteryl esters. Subcutaneous (SC) administration of CI-976 was also  efficacious in cholesterol-fed animals. In sucrose-fed rats, oral and SC CI-976  administration potently lowered plasma triglycerides. Hepatic cholesteryl ester  accumulation in the ethinyl estradiol-treated rat was also diminished by orally  administered CI-976. ACAT activity and cholesteryl ester mass were  dose-dependently decreased in the livers from cholesterol-fed rats treated with  CI-976, suggesting a direct effect on the liver. In both hypercholesterolemic and  hypertriglyceridemic models, CI-976 also decreased plasma apoB concentrations. In  other experiments radiolabeled CI-976 accumulated in the liver after multiple  doses. Time-dependent changes in biliary lipid and bile acid secretion suggested  that free cholesterol did not accumulate in the liver but instead was excreted as  such or as bile acid. Finally, inhibition of endogenous and exogenous intestinal  cholesterol absorption was demonstrated using several in vivo techniques. The  combined data strongly supports the hypothesis that orally administered CI-976  inhibits both intestinal and hepatic ACAT, and that both of these enzymes may be  determinants of plasma lipid concentrations in the rat.","1993-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","279-294","","2","34","","J Lipid Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8429262","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rabbits; Lipid Metabolism; Autoradiography; Liver/*enzymology; Sterol O-Acyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors; Absorption; Cholesterol, HDL/blood; Cholesterol, LDL/blood; Cholesterol, VLDL/blood; Bile/metabolism; Intestines/*enzymology; Bile Acids and Salts/metabolism; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Anilides/*pharmacology; Cholesterol, Dietary/administration & dosage/metabolism; Sucrose/administration & dosage/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each woman had been on  long-term therapy with oral contraceptive steroids (OCS) containing  ethynylestradiol (EE2) and levonorgestrel (Ng) for at least 6 months and all were  in good general health. Blood samples were taken about 11.0 hours after dosing  with their OCS on days 5, 6, 7 and 8 of their contraceptive cycle, for  measurement of EE2, Ng, FSH and LH by radioimmunoassay. In addition blood samples  were taken on days 19, 20 and 21 of the contraceptive cycle for assay of  progesterone concentrations in plasma. The study was repeated in the next cycle  of use of their OCS during which they took temafloxacin, a broad spectrum  quinolone antibiotic in a dose of 600 mg twice daily for 7 days starting on day 1  of the cycle. All women completed the study satisfactorily as judged by diary  cards, tablet counts and plasma temafloxacin concentrations.

A review of principles and practice.","The Journal of reproductive medicine","","0024-7758","","","The percutaneous route is an effective method for delivery of reproductive hormones. Several transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) releasing estrogens,  progestogens and androgens from patches attached to the skin are currently in  clinical use. For women, transdermal systems have been developed for hormonal  replacement therapy (HRT) and recently for contraception. HRT with patches  releasing only estradiol (E2) should be supplemented with a progestogen to  protect the endometrium. Patches simultaneously releasing both E2 and a  progestogen are also available. Combined regimens are either continuous or  sequential. In the latter, estrogen-only patches are applied for 14 days,  followed by 14-day application of patches releasing both hormones. Transdermal  HRT successfully treats menopausal symptoms and has a bone-sparing effect.  Transdermal contraceptive patches deliver ethinyl E2 in combination with the  progestogen norelgestromin. This system provides an effective contraceptive and  acceptable bleeding pattern not different from that of oral contraceptives. The  types of adverse events experienced are approximately the same as with oral  contraceptives. Reactions at the application site cause about 3% women to  discontinue the use of patches. Transdermal systems also have been designed to  supplement testosterone in hypogonadal men. Testosterone released from patches  produces positive effects on mood and sexual behavior and significantly increases  bone mass. Men using testosterone patches have to be regularly monitored for an  increase in prostate volume and changes in prostate-specific antigen.  Reproductive steroids delivered by the skin avoid first-pass liver metabolism,  typical of oral dosing; consequently, the liver tissue is affected to a lesser  degree. Other advantages include rapid onset and termination of action,  noninvasive self-administration and attainment of therapeutic hormone levels with  low daily doses. Reduced frequency of dosing has the potential to improve patient  compliance. While compliance is important for any hormone, it is particularly  important for contraceptive purposes. Like oral delivery of sex steroids,  percutaneous absorption is characterized by intra- and interindividual  variability. New technologies under development, combining electronics and  low-frequency ultrasound, have the potential to provide precise dosing as well as  drug delivery ""on demand.""","2003-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","525-540","","7","48","","J Reprod Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12953327","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Combinations; Equipment Design; Administration, Cutaneous; Drug Delivery Systems; Oximes; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage; Ethisterone/analogs & derivatives; Norgestrel/analogs & derivatives; Contraception/*methods; Contraceptive Agents, Female/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Estradiol/administration & dosage; Estrogen Replacement Therapy/*methods; Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*administration & dosage/blood; Testosterone/administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Women with epilepsy, treated with LTG in monotherapy and taking  combination-type oral contraceptives, were randomized to treatment with placebo  or a standard combination-type contraceptive pill. The dose-corrected trough  plasma concentration of LTG and the ratio of N-2-glucuronide/unchanged LTG on  urine after 21 days of concomitant placebo treatment was analyzed versus those  after 21 days of concomitant treatment with the oral contraceptive pill. RESULTS:  The mean dose-corrected LTG concentration after placebo treatment was 84%[95%  confidence interval (CI), 45-134%] higher than after oral contraceptives,  signifying an almost doubling of the concentration after cessation of oral  contraceptives. Most of this increase took place within the first week after oral  contraceptives were stopped. The N-2-glucuronide/LTG ratio in the urine was  decreased by 31% (95% CI, -20-61%) when shifting from oral contraceptives to  placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Cessation of oral contraceptives leads to an 84% increase  in the concentration of LTG. In parallel, the excretion of the N-2-glucuronide  was decreased, indicating that the changes are caused by altered LTG  glucuronidation. The change in LTG concentrations was observed within 1 week of  the shift of treatment, suggesting that induction and deinduction of LTG  glucuronidation is faster than that seen for other metabolic pathways (e.g.,  cytochrome P450).","2007-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","484-489","","3","48","","Epilepsia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17346247","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Drug Interactions; Cross-Over Studies; Placebos; Lamotrigine; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*pharmacokinetics; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacokinetics; Anticonvulsants/blood/*metabolism/urine; Epilepsy/*drug therapy/metabolism; Glucuronides/metabolism/urine; Triazines/blood/*metabolism/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the choleretic potential of boldine, including its  molecular background. The acute- and long-term effects of boldine were evaluated  in rats either during intravenous infusion or after 28-day oral treatment.  Infusion of boldine instantly increased the bile flow 1.4-fold in healthy rats as  well as in animals with Mrp2 deficiency or ethinylestradiol induced cholestasis.  This effect was not associated with a corresponding increase in bile acid or  glutathione biliary excretion, indicating that the effect is not related to  stimulation of either bile acid dependent or independent mechanisms of bile  formation and points to the osmotic activity of boldine itself. We subsequently  analyzed bile production under conditions of changing biliary excretion of  boldine after bolus intravenous administration and found strong correlations  between both parameters. HPLC analysis showed that bile concentrations of boldine  above 10 μM were required for induction of choleresis. Importantly, long-term  pretreatment, when the bile collection study was performed 24-h after the last  administration of boldine, also accelerated bile formation despite undetectable  levels of the compound in bile. The effect paralleled upregulation of the Bsep  transporter and increased biliary clearance of its substrates, bile acids. We  consequently confirmed the ability of boldine to stimulate the Bsep  transcriptional regulator, FXR receptor. In conclusion, our study clarified the  mechanisms and circumstances surrounding the choleretic activity of boldine.","2015-05-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","12-22","","1","285","","Toxicol Appl Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: This was an open-label,  nonrandomized, multicenter, two-parallel group, one-sequence crossover study. In  Group 1, Cycle 1 was a baseline cycle to determine the PK of OC and levels of sex  hormones. At the start of Cycle 2, patients continued to receive OC and single  TCZ dosing on Day 1. In Cycle 2, we determined the PK of OC and levels of sex  hormones when OC and TCZ were combined. In Cycle 3, we determined the PK of OC  and the levels of sex hormones after TCZ treatment was stopped. PK for EE and NE  were analyzed serially on Day 7 when maximum TCZ effect on inflammation as  indicated by C-reactiv protein (CRP) was expected. Hormone levels (PG, LH and  FSH) were measured mid-cycle (cycle Days 12 - 16 and Day 21) during each cycle.  Group 2 (healthy subjects) was studied to compare the levels of OC PK exposures  with those in each cycle of Group 1 (RA subjects). RESULTS: Levels of PG, LH and  FSH were not affected by the combination of TCZ/OC treatment in RA patients  studied. No breakthrough bleeding was attributed to the initiation of TCZ  treatment in subjects receiving OCs. PK exposures of EE and NE were similar  between RA and healthy subjects at baseline and were not affected by single-dose  TCZ. Administration of OC with or without a single dose of TCZ was well  tolerated.

Therefore, native LDL and synthetic LDL-like particles have been proposed as  carriers for antineoplastic drugs. We demonstrated earlier that small  apolipoprotein E (apoE)-exposing liposomes were specifically recognized by the  LDL receptor. In this study, we incorporated a lipophilic derivative of  daunorubicin (LAD) into the apoE liposomes. Up to 11 molecules of LAD could be  incorporated per particle without significantly changing the size, lipid  composition, and ability to bind apoE of the liposomes. The biological fate of  the prodrug was largely determined by its carrier (70% of the initially  incorporated LAD was still associated to the liposomes after 4 h of circulation  in mice). Compared with free daunorubicin, the circulation half-life of the  liposome-associated prodrug was substantially prolonged and undesired tissue  disposition was reduced. The role of the LDL receptor in the metabolism of  LAD-loaded apoE liposomes was demonstrated in rats with up-regulated hepatic LDL  receptors. In these rats, the liver uptake of the prodrug and carrier was  increased 5-fold. The addition of apoE was essential for LDL receptor-mediated  uptake of the drug-carrier complex. In LDL receptor-deficient mice, the  circulation time of both the prodrug and the carrier increased approximately  2-fold compared with wild-type mice. We conclude that LAD-loaded apoE liposomes  constitute a stable drug-carrier complex that is well suited for LDL  receptor-mediated selective drug delivery to tumors.","1999-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1-7","","1","289","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10086980","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Rats, Wistar; Liver/metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism; Drug Carriers; Liposomes; Iodine Radioisotopes; Apolipoproteins E; Ethinyl Estradiol/pharmacology; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Prodrugs/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Receptors, LDL/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have therefore determined the serum distribution  of these NGM metabolites and assessed their steady-state concentrations in women  following >or=3 cycles of oral contraceptive (OC) use. The administration of 250  microg NGM/35 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) resulted in significantly higher sex  hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels (p = 0.002), and 30% lower serum  non-protein-bound (NPB) levels of testosterone, when compared to treatment with  150 microg LNG/30 microg EE. We also confirmed that NGMN does not bind to SHBG,  and found that 97.2% of this metabolite is bound to albumin while only 2.8% is in  the NPB fraction. In contrast, most of the LNG was bound to SHBG (92.5% and 87.2%  after NGM/EE and LNG/EE treatment, respectively), and the NPB fraction of LNG  (0.7%) during NGM/EE treatment was lower (p < 0.001) than during LNG/EE treatment  (1.4%). Combining these serum distributions with the C(max) and AUC(0-24h) data  obtained after NGM/EE treatment gave NPB and albumin-bound values of NGMN that  were much greater than the corresponding LNG values. Furthermore, the C(max) and  AUC(0-24h) values for NPB LNG during NGM/EE treatment were estimated to be lower  than during LNG/EE treatment. Since LNG is primarily bound by SHBG, its access to  target tissues is restricted. Moreover, because SHBG does not bind NGMN, it  appears to be quantitatively the more important NGM metabolite available to  target tissues, and probably accounts for a substantial proportion of the  progestogenic activity of NGM/EE OCs. However, it is also possible that  simultaneous exposure of NGMN and LNG after treatment with NGM/EE may provide  clinical benefits not seen with LNG/EE combinations.","2003-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","93-99","","2","67","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12586319","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Combinations; Testosterone/blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Serum Albumin/metabolism; Oximes; Ethinyl Estradiol/administration & dosage; Ethisterone/analogs & derivatives; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*blood; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/*blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/*blood; Norgestrel/*analogs & derivatives/*blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both US EPA and OECD guidelines specify  that test substance is administered daily either by subcutaneous injection or  oral gavage. However, dietary administration is a relevant exposure route for  agrochemical regulatory toxicology studies due to potential human intake via crop  residues. In this study, equivalent doses of positive control chemicals  administered via dietary and gavage routes of administration were compared in the  uterotrophic (17α-ethinyl estradiol) and Hershberger (flutamide, linuron,  dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane; 4,4'-DDE) assays in ovariectomized and  castrated rats, respectively. For all positive control chemicals tested,  statistically significant changes in organ weights and decreases in food  consumption were observed by both routes of test substance administration.  Decreased body weight gain observed for dietary linuron and 4,4'-DDE indicated  that the maximum tolerated dose was exceeded. Hershberger dietary administration  resulted in a similar blood exposure (AUC(24)) for each positive control chemical  when compared to gavage. Overall, the correlation in organ weight changes for  both the uterotrophic and Hershberger assays suggest that dietary administration  is an acceptable route of exposure with similar sensitivity to oral gavage dosing  for evaluation of the endocrine potential of a test substance and represents a  more appropriate route of test substance administration for most environmental  exposure scenarios.","2021-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","104820","","","119","","Regul Toxicol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

When ranked, the lowest IC(50) (concentration of inhibitor  required to decrease activity by 50%) values were obtained with recombinant  CYP1A1 (rCYP1A1) [IC(50(total)) = IC(50(free)) = 2.7 microM] and CYP2C19 activity  in human liver microsomes (HLM) [IC(50(total)) = 4.4 microM; IC(50(free)) = 2.8  microM]. For rCYP1A1, formal inhibition studies revealed that EE was a  competitive inhibitor [K(i(free)) = 1.4 microM]. All the other IC(50) values were  greater than 8.0 microM, and the weakest inhibition was observed with CYP1A2  activity in HLM (IC(50(free)) > 39 microM). In agreement, the IC(50)  characterizing the inhibition of melatonin (MEL) 6-hydroxylation in human  intestine microsomes (CYP1A1-catalyzed) was lower than that of HLM (0.91 versus  >40 microM). Because EE is known to affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP2C19 probe  drugs, this result raises the possibility that the concentration of EE during  first pass may exceed 1000 nM, sufficient to affect CYP1A1 and CYP2C19, with less  impact on CYP3A4 and other P450s. The results implicate intestinal CYP1A1, and  possibly CYP2C19, as the loci of EE drug interactions with highly extracted drugs  like MEL. Overall, it is very difficult to rationalize drug interactions  involving EE based on direct inhibition of CYP2B6 (e.g., selegiline) and hepatic  CYP1A2 (e.g., MEL, tizanidine, caffeine, and theophylline).","2009-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1667-1675","","8","37","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19454483","","","","Humans; Kinetics; In Vitro Techniques; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19; Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism; *Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Hydroxylation; Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymology; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6; Intestines/drug effects/enzymology; Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacology; Melatonin/metabolism; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Desogestrel is rapidly and completely  metabolized in the liver and gut wall to 3-keto-desogestrel, which is the active  metabolite mediating the progestin effects. Because of its unique 11-methylene  side chain, desogestrel cannot be metabolized to any other known progestin, nor  is desogestrel a naturally occurring metabolite of any other progestin. The  pharmacokinetic parameters of 3-keto-desogestrel are generally comparable with  those of levonorgestrel and norethindrone. Therefore any differences in  pharmacologic activities must be attributed to differences in intrinsic  activities. Unlike gestodene, 3-keto-desogestrel has a lower affinity for sex  hormone-binding globulin, which results in markedly lower plasma levels after  administration. After oral administration of 150 micrograms of desogestrel,  plasma levels are less than half the levels of gestodene after an oral dose of 75  micrograms.","1993-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:36:57","","1021-1028","","3 Pt 2","168","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8447355","","","","Humans; Female; Biology; Biotransformation; Biological Availability; Carrier Proteins; Liver/metabolism; Physiology; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Testosterone/blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Contraception; Family Planning; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--pharmacodynamics; *Literature Review; *Desogestrel--pharmacodynamics; *Metabolic Effects; Desogestrel/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined  the pharmacokinetic and clinical interaction between rizatriptan 10 mg and the  components (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 35 micrograms and norethindrone [NET] 1.0 mg)  of a well-established oral contraceptive combination product, ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35.  Levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a protein increased by EE to which  NET binds, were also examined. In this two-period crossover study, 20 healthy  young female subjects received a coadministration of 8 days of rizatriptan  treatment (6 days of single-dose 10 mg rizatriptan and 2 days of multiple-dose  rizatriptan, 10 mg q 4 hours for three doses, giving a total daily dose of 30 mg  on Days 7 and 8) or matching placebo along with their daily dose (one tablet) of  ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35 within their oral contraceptive cycle. Plasma was sampled for  EE, NET, and SHBG concentrations. Safety evaluations included routine laboratory  safety studies, physical examinations, and monitoring for ECG, vital signs, and  adverse events. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the  pharmacokinetic parameters of EE or NET between the rizatriptan and placebo  treatment periods, thus indicating that rizatriptan had no meaningful effect on  the disposition of either the EE or the NET component of ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35. The  SHBG concentration did not change throughout the entire study. Clinically,  coadministration of rizatriptan with ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35 was well tolerated. Blood  pressure, heart rate, and temperature showed no consistent trend or clinically  important changes. Adverse events following coadministration of rizatriptan with  ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35 were similar to those reported when placebo was given with  ORTHO-NOVUM 1/35. The findings of this study indicate that there is little  potential for dosages as high as 30 mg/day, the maximum recommended dosing  schedule, of rizatriptan to alter the plasma concentrations of oral  contraceptives.","2000-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:38:35","","309-315","","3","40","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10709161","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Antagonism; Drug Combinations; Placebos; Receptors, Serotonin/drug effects; Norethindrone/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/pharmacokinetics; Mestranol/*pharmacokinetics; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1B; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1D; Serotonin Receptor Agonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Triazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Tryptamines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was a significant negative correlation between the serum NET  concentration and the time after dosing in all women. There were large  inter-subject variations in the pharmacokinetic parameters, the elimination  half-life and bioavailability showing 3- and 5- fold variability, respectively.

In combination with drospirenone (DRSP) or levonorgestrel (LNG), E4 blocks  ovulation and has less effect on haemostatic biomarkers in comparison with  ethinylestradiol (EE) combined with DRSP. This study evaluates the impact of  several doses of E4/DRSP and E4/LNG on safety parameters such as liver function,  lipid metabolism, bone markers and growth endocrine parameters. METHODS: This was  a dose-finding, single-centre, controlled study performed in healthy women aged  18 to 35 years with a documented pretreatment ovulatory cycle. Participants  received 5 mg or 10 mg E4/3 mg DRSP; 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg E4/150 μg LNG; or 20 μg  EE/3 mg DRSP as a comparator for three consecutive cycles in a 24/4-day regimen.  Changes from baseline to end of treatment in liver parameters, lipid metabolism,  bone markers and growth endocrinology were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 109  women were included in the study. Carrier proteins were minimally affected in the  E4/DRSP and E4/LNG groups, in comparison with the EE/DRSP group, where a  significant increase in sex hormone-binding globulin was observed. Similarly,  minor effects on lipoproteins were observed in the E4 groups, and the effects on  triglycerides elicited by the E4 groups were significantly lower than those in  the EE/DRSP group. No imbalances in bone markers were observed in any groups. No  alterations in insulin-like growth factor were observed in the E4 groups.  CONCLUSIONS: E4-containing combinations have a limited effect on liver function,  lipid metabolism, and bone and growth endocrine parameters.","2015","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","463-475","","6","20","","Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26212489  PMCID: PMC4699469","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Young Adult; Ethinyl Estradiol/*pharmacology; Levonorgestrel/*pharmacology; Triglycerides/blood; Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood; gamma-Glutamyltransferase/blood; Lipid Metabolism/drug effects; Liver function; Levonorgestrel; Cholesterol, LDL/blood/drug effects; Cholesterol, HDL/blood/drug effects; Alkaline Phosphatase/blood; Lipid metabolism; Estrogens/pharmacology; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Drospirenone; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/pharmacology; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/drug effects/metabolism; Androstenes/*pharmacology; Bone markers; Collagen Type I/blood/drug effects; Endocrinology; Estetrol; Estetrol/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Growth Hormone/blood/drug effects; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/drug effects/metabolism; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/drug effects/metabolism; Liver/*drug effects/physiology; Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists/pharmacology; Osteocalcin/blood/drug effects; Peptides/blood/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The predictive value of single-dose administration for the  pharmacokinetic behavior of a progestin during long-term treatment was  investigated for two triphasic oral contraceptives. One contained levonorgestrel  and the other gestodene, each in combination with ethinyl estradiol. In eight  Japanese women who received the levonorgestrel-containing formulation over a  treatment cycle, steady-state trough levels of levonorgestrel were higher than  those obtained by computer simulation based on single-dose administration. An  analogous observation was made in a group of 10 white women who received the  gestodene-containing formulation. A close correlation between gestodene and sex  hormone-binding globulin concentrations was demonstrated for eight subjects; the  other two patients already had initially high sex hormone-binding globulin  levels. Ethinyl estradiol-induced production of sex hormone-binding globulin  seems to be a major factor that contributes to the accumulation of the two  progestins in the plasma.

L.","Pharmacokinetic drug interactions with oral contraceptives.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199018060-00004","","Oral contraceptive steroids are used by an estimated 60 to 70 million women world-wide. Over the past 20 years there have been both case reports and clinical  studies on the topic of drug interactions with these agents. Some of the  interactions are of definite therapeutic relevance, whereas others can be  discounted as being of no clinical significance. Pharmacological interactions  between oral contraceptive steroids and other compounds may be of 2 kinds: (a)  drugs may impair the efficacy of oral contraceptive steroids, leading to  breakthrough bleeding and pregnancy (in a few cases, the activity of the  contraceptive is enhanced); (b) oral contraceptive steroids may interfere with  the metabolism of other drugs. A number of anticonvulsants (phenobarbital,  phenytoin, carbamazepine) are enzyme-inducing agents and thereby increase the  clearance of the oral contraceptive steroids. Valproic acid has no  enzyme-inducing properties, and thus women on this anticonvulsant can rely on  their low dose oral contraceptive steroids for contraceptive protection.  Researchers are now beginning to unravel the molecular basis of this interaction,  with evidence of specific forms of cytochrome P450 (P450IIC and IIIA gene  families) being induced by phenobarbital. Rifampicin, the antituberculous drug,  also induces a cytochrome P450 which is a product of the P450IIIA gene subfamily.  This isozyme is one of the major forms involved in 2-hydroxylation of  ethinylestradiol. Broad spectrum antibiotics have been implicated in causing pill  failure; case reports document the interaction, and general practitioners are  convinced that it is real. The problem remains that there is still no firm  clinical pharmacokinetic evidence which indicates that blood concentrations of  oral contraceptive steroids are altered by antibiotics. However, perhaps this  should not be a surprise, given that the incidence of the interaction may be very  low. It is suggested that an individual at risk will have a low bioavailability  of ethinylestradiol, a large enterohepatic recirculation and gut flora  particularly susceptible to the antibiotic being used. Two drugs, ascorbic acid  (vitamin C) and paracetamol (acetaminophen), give rise to increased blood  concentrations of ethinylestradiol due to competition for sulphation. The  interactions could have some significance to women on oral contraceptive steroids  who regularly take high doses of either drug. Although on theoretical grounds  adsorbents (e.g. magnesium trisilicate, aLuminium hydroxide, activated charcoal  and kaolin) could be expected to interfere with oral contraceptive efficacy,  there is no firm evidence that this is the case. Similarly, there is no evidence  that smoking alters the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptive steroids. These  agents are now well documented as being able to alter the pharmacokinetics of  other concomitantly administered drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:24:56","","472-484","","6","18","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2191822","","","","Humans; Animals; Biology; Drug Interactions; Europe; Physiology; *Drug Interactions; England; *Alcohol Drinking; United Kingdom; Developed Countries; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; Treatment; Behavior; Vitamins; Prostaglandins; *Drugs; Northern Europe; Endocrine System; *Plasma Protein Binding Capacity; Hemic System; *Literature Review; *Oral Contraceptives; Enzymes And Enzyme Inhibitors; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; *Enzymes; *Antibiotics; *Ascorbic Acid; *Prostaglandin Antagonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experimental models were made up of female rabbits  with bilaterally removed ovaries or those being given mestranol for a long time .  N-acetyl-p-amino-phenol and phenazone were the model substances. The effect of  surplus as well as deficiency of estrogens on the pharmacokinetics of drugs was  ascertained. The surface area under the curve of paracetamol concentration  changes was found to diminish after the bilateral removal of ovaries; there was a  shortening of the half-life period for the elimination phase, and also an  increase of the total clearance. The application of mestranol has made the  mentioned parameters behave adversely. The bilateral ovariectomy has led to an  increase in the surface area under the curve for phenazone concentration changes,  elongation of its half-life period for the elimination phase, and the diminution  of the total clearance. These parameters followed the course in a manner being  inverse to that in animals receiving mestranol. It may be concluded that  estrogens induce the microsomal system of oxidases with mixed function, and exert  inhibitory action on enzymes mediating in reactions of coupling.","1991","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:18","","35-47","","","37","","Ann Acad Med Stetin","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 1816754","","","","Female; Animals; Rabbits; Time Factors; Postoperative Period; Half-Life; Biotransformation/drug effects; *Models, Biological; Microsomes, Liver/*drug effects/metabolism; Antipyrine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; *Ovariectomy; Acetaminophen/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology; Mestranol/*administration & dosage/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current  application relies on observing subtle changes in the fluorescence lifetime of  the intrinsic fluorophores present in the intracellular region between  corneocytes of the stratum corneum. We have comprehensively characterized the  measured fluorescence lifetimes from intracorneocyte junctions in three skin  section types (dermatomed skin, epidermal membranes and stratum corneum)  revealing statistically significant differences of the short lifetime component  between each of the types, which we attribute to the sample preparation and  imaging method. We show using epidermal membrane sections that application of a  drug/solvent formulation consisting of ethinyl estradiol and spectroscopic grade  ethanol to the surface gives rise to a slight but statistically significant  shortening of the fluorescence lifetime of the long-lived emitting species  present in the sample, from approximately 2.8 ns to 2.5 ns.

With the present tendency to decrease the doses of both estrogens and progestogens, any  factor that reduces the bioavailability of the lower-dose preparations may have  an impact on contraceptive protection. Although ethinyl estradiol, the most  commonly used oral estrogen, is liable to an enterohepatic circulation as  unchanged drug, the commonly used progestogens are not. At present, no convincing  evidence exists in the human subject that disruption of the enterohepatic  circulation by antibiotics or antacids does reduce contraceptive efficacy of the  pill. Oral contraceptive steroids are mainly absorbed from the small bowel, and  contraceptive efficacy depends on its absorptive capacity. Enhanced passage of  gastrointestinal contents or impaired absorption may thus contribute to  contraceptive failures in patients who have chronic inflammatory disease,  diarrhea, ileostomy, or jejunoileal bypass.","1990-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","2204-2207","","6 Pt 2","163","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2256527","","","","Humans; Female; Hormones; Biology; Biological Availability; Enterohepatic Circulation; Physiology; Drugs; Chronic Disease; Contraception; Family Planning; Treatment; Metabolic Effects; Gastrointestinal Diseases/*metabolism; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Methods--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*pharmacokinetics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; Endocrine System; *Hepatic Effects; *Estrogens--pharmacodynamics; *Steroid Metabolic Effects; *Oral Contraceptives--pharmacodynamics; *Gastrointestinal Effects; Contraceptive Usage; Progestational Hormones; *Antibiotics; *Progesterone--pharmacodynamics; *Mestranol; *Contraception Failure--determinants; *Drug Interactions--determinants; Antacids/adverse effects; Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extra  blood samples were obtained at weeks 21, 22, and 23 in 61 MPA/E(2)C users and 51  NET/EE users (index-cycle analysis population) to investigate lipid changes  during one cycle of use. In the index-cycle population, median changes from  screening to week 60 showed a decrease in apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apo A-II  in both groups. MPA/E(2)C users had a decrease in total cholesterol (C), total  triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), with maintenance of the total C/HDL-C ratio.  NET/EE users showed an increase in total C and LDL-C, with no change in HDL-C or  the total C/HDL-C ratio.

However, a direct  comparison of the effects of MPA/E(2)C and NET/EE on lipid profiles was not  possible in this study because of its design and because of the baseline and  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic differences between the two contraceptive groups.  The results of this analysis showed that, although overall lipid values  decreased, including a significant decrease in HDL cholesterol, the maintenance  of the total-C/HDL-C ratio suggests that the effect of MPA/E(2)C on lipid  parameters may not negatively affect CVD risk over 1 year of use.

It is contained in many oral contraceptive preparations,  both combined (COCs) to ethinyl-estradiol (EE) or alone in a progestin-only pill  (POP). Its principal metabolite (etonogestrel, ETN) is the only progestin used  for intravaginal combined contraception and one of the most used for subdermal  hormonal contraception. AREAS COVERED: This is a review of the available data on  the pharmacokinetics of DSG and ETN in hormonal contraception. The material  included was searched and obtained via Medline, PubMed, and EMBASE up to July  2013 using the search terms 'pharmacokinetics, metabolism' in combination with  'desogestrel, etonogestrel, and progestins.' EXPERT OPINION: DSG and its  metabolite ETN are very suitable molecules for use in hormonal contraception. For  the oral use the molecule used is DSG, while for parenteral routes (intravaginal,  subdermal) its metabolite ETN is the compound of choice. In both cases (oral and  parenteral) the active molecule in the organism is the latter (ETN), due to the  rapid in vivo metabolism of oral DSG. The contraceptive efficacy and tolerability  of all the formulations present on the market (mono/multiphasic EE/DSG COCs, DSG  POP, EE/ETN vaginal ring, ETN implant) are reassuring, permitting a long-term  use. The estrogenic component increases the contraindications, forcing the  prescription to the safer only-progestin preparations, DSG POP or ETN implant.","2014-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1-10","","1","10","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24102478","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Administration, Oral; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Contraceptive Agents, Female/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Desogestrel/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bio-activation of the hop  phytoestrogen isoxanthohumol to the potent oestrogen 8-prenylnaringenin was also  investigated. The oestrogenic potency values for reference standards determined  with the RCBA (17beta-oestradiol = 100%) were: methoxychlor 0.0025%, mestranol  1.3%, isoxanthohumol 0.001%, and for their potential respective metabolites were:  bishydroxymethoxychlor 0.015%, 17alpha-ethynyl oestradiol 69% and  8-prenylnaringenin 0.4%. Incubation of methoxychlor and mestranol (10 microM)  with microsomes prepared from the liver of rats treated with Aroclor 1254  significantly increased (p < 0.001) their oestrogenic potency from 0.0021 and  2.4% to 0.015 and 8.3%, respectively. In contrast, the potency of the hop  phytoestrogen isoxanthohumol was unchanged. Metabolites were identified by  UV-HPLC-MS/MS as monohydroxy methoxychlor and HPTE from methoxychlor, and the  major metabolite of mestranol was 17alpha-ethynyl oestradiol. There was no  evidence for the metabolism of isoxanthohumol. Mestranol was also activated by  microsomes induced with saline (control), beta-napthoflavone,  3-methylcholantherene, isoniazid or pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile, but not  phenobarbitone. These studies demonstrate the principle for use of a binary assay  system for the detection of pro-oestrogens and indicate the potential value for  risk assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals.","2002-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1138-1147","","12","19","","Food Addit Contam","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12623674","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Biotransformation; Microsomes, Liver/metabolism; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods; Genes, Reporter; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Biological Assay/methods; Estradiol Congeners/*analysis/pharmacokinetics; Food Analysis/*methods; Food Contamination/*analysis; Insecticides/analysis; Mestranol/analysis; Methoxychlor/analysis; Receptors, Estrogen/genetics; Yeasts/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence is presented that plasma levels of steroids may be  influenced if the intestinal microflora is altered. Some formation of  biologically active steroids, like estradiol, may occur in the intestinal tract  and this may have both biological and pathological consequences and may be  influenced by such factors as diet and sex.

Oral ingestion of steroids has a stronger effect on hepatic  metabolism than parenteral administration, as the local concentration in liver  sinusoids are 4-5 times higher during the first liver passage. Oestradiol and  oestrone are interconvertible, dependent on the local concentrations in liver and  target organs, and oestrone sulphate serves as a large reservoir. The  oestrone/oestradiol ratio has no physiological significance, as oestrone is only  a weak oestrogen. Oestrone is both a precursor and a metabolite of oestradiol.  Oestriol is extensively conjugated after oral administration. Therefore, the  oestriol serum levels are similar after oral intake of 10 mg and after vaginal  application of 0.5 mg oestriol resulting in similar systemic effectiveness.  Conjugated oestrogens can easily enter the hepatocytes but are hormonally active  only after hydrolyzation into the parent steroids. Ethinylestradiol which exerts  strong effects on hepatic metabolism and inhibits metabolizing enzymes, should  not be used for hormone replacement therapy. Among the progestogens, the  progesterone derivatives have less effects on liver metabolism than the  norethisterone derivatives (13-methyl-gonanes and 13-ethyl-gonanes). The highly  potent 13-ethyl-gonanes are effective at very low doses, because of a slow  inactivation and elimination rate due to the ethinyl group.","1990-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","171-197","","3","12","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 2170822","","","","Humans; Female; Hormones; Biology; Physiology; Research Methodology; Contraception; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Metabolic Effects; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; *Ethinyl Estradiol--pharmacodynamics; *Norethindrone--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; *Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; *Levonorgestrel--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Estrogen--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--pharmacodynamics; *Cyproterone Acetate--pharmacodynamics; Endocrine System; Hormone Antagonists; *Estrogens--pharmacodynamics; *Steroid Metabolic Effects; Progestational Hormones; *Norethindrone Acetate--pharmacodynamics; *Measurement; Progesterone/metabolism; *Estradiol--analysis; *Ethynodiol Diacetate--pharmacodynamics; *Lynestrenol--pharmacodynamics; *Progesterone--pharmacodynamics; *Estrone--analysis; *Chlormadinone Acetate--pharmacodynamics; *Estriol--analysis; Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Estrogens/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Progesterone Congeners/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Incubations of pooled human liver microsomes, human liver S9  fractions, HepaRG-cells, and human hepatocytes were performed with glutathione as  a trapping agent. Experiments with liver S9 were performed under two conditions,  using only NADPH and using a full set of cofactors enabling also conjugative  metabolism. Ten structurally different compounds were used as a test set, chosen  as either ""positive"" (ciprofloxacin, clozapine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol,  pulegone, and ticlopidine) or ""negative"" (caffeine, citalopram, losartan,  montelukast) compounds, based on their known adverse reactions on liver or bone  marrow. GSH conjugates were observed for seven of the ten compounds; while no  conjugates were observed for caffeine, citalopram, or ciprofloxacin. Hepatocyte  and HepaRG assays produced a clearly lower number and lower relative abundance of  GSH conjugates compared to assays with microsomes and S9 fractions. The major GSH  conjugates were different for many compounds in cellular subfractions and  cell-based systems. Hepatocytes generally produced a higher number of GSH  conjugates than HepaRG cells, although the differences were minor. The results  show that the hepatic enzyme system used for screening of GSH-trapped reactive  metabolites do have a high impact on the results, and results between different  systems are comparable only qualitatively.","2015-11-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","345-351","","","115","","J Pharm Biomed Anal","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

STUDY DESIGN: We  conducted a 12-sample, 24-hour pharmacokinetic study in healthy reproductive-age  females taking a COCP containing 0.15-mg desogestrel (DSG) and 30-μg ethinyl  estradiol (EE). As DSG is a pro-drug for etonogestrel (ENG), we calculated  correlations between steady-state C(24) and 24-hour AUC values for both ENG and  EE. RESULTS: Among 19 participants at steady state, C(24) measurements were  highly correlated with AUC for both ENG (r = 0.93; 95% CI 0.83-0.98) and EE  (r = 0.87; 95% CI 0.68-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Steady-state 24-hour trough  concentrations are high-quality proxies for gold standard pharmacokinetics of a  DSG-containing COCP. IMPLICATIONS: Use of single-time trough concentration  measurements at steady state provides excellent surrogate results for gold  standard AUC values for both DSG and EE among COCP users. These findings support  that large studies exploring interindividual variability in COCP pharmacokinetics  can avoid the time- and resource-intensive costs associated with measuring AUC.

Concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 substrates altered mean  AUC0-5 h and mean Cmax for repaglinide by 1% and 17%  (ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel), 2% and 27% (simvastatin), or 11% and 3%  (nifedipine). Profiles of blood glucose concentration following repaglinide  dosing were altered by less than 8% by both ketoconazole and rifampicin. In all  five studies, most adverse events were related to hypoglycemia, as expected in a  normal population given a blood glucose regulator. The safety profile of  repaglinide was not altered by pretreatment with ketoconazole or rifampicin or by  coadministration with ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel. The incidence of adverse  events increased with coadministration of simvastatin or nifedipine compared to  either repaglinide or simvastatin/nifedipine treatment alone. No clinically  relevant pharmacokinetic interactions occurred between repaglinide and the CYP3A4  substrates ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine. The  pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide was altered by administration of potent  inhibitors or inducers, such as ketoconazole or rifampicin, but to a lesser  degree than expected. These results are probably explained by the metabolic  pathway of repaglinide that involves other enzymes than CYP3A4, reflected to some  extent by a small change in repaglinide pharmacodynamics. Thus, careful  monitoring of blood glucose in repaglinide-treated patients receiving strong  inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is recommended, and an increase in repaglinide  dose may be necessary. No safety concerns were observed, except a higher  incidence in adverse events in patients receiving repaglinide and simvastatin or  nifedipine.","2003-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:37","","649-660","","6","43","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12817528","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Rifampin/pharmacology; *Drug Interactions; Ketoconazole/pharmacology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*drug effects/metabolism; Blood Glucose/drug effects; Simvastatin/pharmacology; *Carbamates/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; *Hypoglycemic Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; *Piperidines/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge of potential drug-drug interactions  (DDIs) with OCs becomes imperative to provide information on the medication to  women of childbearing potential and enable their inclusion in clinical trials,  especially if the new molecular entity is a teratogen. Although a number of DDI  guidance documents are available, they do not provide recommendations for the  design and conduct of OC DDI studies. The evaluation of DDI potential of a new  molecular entity and OCs is particularly challenging because of the availability  of a wide variety of combinations of hormonal contraceptives, different doses of  the ethinyl estradiol, and different metabolic profiles of the progestin  component. The aim of this review is to comprehensively discuss factors to be  considered such as pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), choice of OC,  and study population for the conduct of in vivo OC DDI studies. In this context,  metabolic pathways of OCs, the effect of enzyme inhibitors and inducers, the role  of sex hormone-binding globulin in the PK of progestins, current evidence on OC  DDIs, and the interpretation of PD end points are reviewed. With the emergence of  new tools like physiologically based PK modeling, the decision to conduct an in  vivo study can be made with much more confidence. This review provides a  comprehensive overview of various factors that need to be considered in designing  OC DDI studies and recommends PK-based DDI studies with PK end points as adequate  measures to establish clinical drug interaction and measurement of PD end points  when there is basis for PD interaction.","2020-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","S49-S62","","","60 Suppl 2","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33274510","","","","Humans; Female; Models, Biological; pharmacokinetics; drug-drug interaction; *Drug Interactions; oral contraceptives; pharmacodynamics; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; ethinyl estradiol; Contraceptives, Oral/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers/pharmacokinetics; progestin; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/pharmacokinetics; study design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has an  anti-estrogenic effect and, in contrast to natural progesterone, shows moderate  anti-androgenic properties. CMA acts by blocking androgen receptors in target  organs and by reducing the activity of skin 5alpha-reductase. It suppresses  gonadotropin secretion and thereby reduces ovarian and adrenal androgen  production. CMA shows high contraceptive efficacy by inhibiting ovulation due to  its ability to suppress or disrupt endogenous gonadotropin secretion and, by  this, inhibits follicular growth and maturation. In addition, it suppresses  endometrial thickness and increases the viscosity of cervical mucus.  Pharmacokinetic studies have shown rapid and almost complete absorption after  oral administration, and CMA is being bound to albumin rather than SHBG  (Sex-Hormone-Binding-Globulin). Multiple dosing studies have demonstrated that  steady state is reached by day 7 after oral administration with peak plasma  concentrations in the region of 2 ng/ml. After a single dose of CMA the half-life  time is around 34 hours and after multiple dose administration approximately 38  hours. Safety studies have indicated that CMA has no clinically relevant effect  on a wide range of metabolic parameters in normal subjects. Further studies in  groups at high thromboembolic risk have shown that CMA alone produces a relative  risk of 0.8 which is not considered significant. These results indicated the  potential for CMA to be combined with ethinylestradiol in an oral contraceptive  which provides highly effective contraception and excellent cycle control.","2005","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:06","","7-11","","","10 Suppl 1","","Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16356876","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Intestinal Absorption; Androgen Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Chlormadinone Acetate/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-one were  users of oral contraceptives (OCA). Folate intake from the restricted diet was  159 +/- 5 micrograms/day, as assessed by dietary surveys. Serum folate of women  taking OCA was lower than in nonusers at the inception of the study (P less than  0.01). During the initial 2 weeks of restricted diet, serum folates decreased  significantly (13.8 +/- 1.8 to 8.5 +/- 0.4 ng/ml; P less than 0.002). This  decrease was further prevented by supplementation of the diet for 7 weeks with  100 micrograms/day of total folate from reconstituted frozen orange juice or  synthetic folic acid (PteGlu).

To investigate a potential mechanism for the  interaction of contaminants with the endocrine system, we evaluated the cellular  bioavailability of numerous chemicals. Hormone binding proteins from oviductal  cytosol of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and yellow-bellied  turtle (Trachemys scripta) were used in competitive binding assays with [3H] 17  beta-estradiol. Most of the environmental contaminants, and the potent, synthetic  estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES), did not interact with the cytosolic binding  proteins. Among the compounds tested, o,p'-DDT and toxaphene exhibited the  greatest affinity for the binding proteins. The functional consequence of the  apparent lack of interaction of most contaminants with binding proteins was  studied in a strain of yeast containing the human estrogen receptor (YES assay).  The activation of YES with estradiol was reduced 30% in the presence of a  physiological concentration (0.01 mg/mL) of human sex hormone binding globulin  (SHBG), a hormone binding protein found in the blood. In contrast, the activity  of DES was not inhibited by 0.01 mg/mL SHBG. Interestingly, ethinyl estradiol, a  major component of contraceptives, did not appear to appreciably interact with  SHBG in the YES system. Together, these data suggest that cytosolic and  circulating binding proteins bind many environmental contaminants with much less  affinity than native steroids. Therefore, such contaminants may be more  hormonally active than previously hypothesized.","1998-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","261-273","","1-2","14","","Toxicol Ind Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9460179","","","","Humans; Animals; Drug Interactions; Biological Availability; Cytosol; Binding, Competitive; Turtles; Estradiol/*pharmacokinetics; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/pharmacokinetics; Alligators and Crocodiles; Animals, Wild; Carrier Proteins/blood/*metabolism; DDT/pharmacokinetics; Diethylstilbestrol/pharmacokinetics; Endocrine System/*drug effects; Environmental Pollutants/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Gonadal Steroid Hormones/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A.","Estrogen carcinogenesis in Syrian hamster tissues: role of metabolism.","Federation proceedings","","0014-9446","","","Evidence for a role of estrogen metabolism in hormonal carcinogenesis was obtained with the Syrian hamster as an in vivo model system. Both natural and  synthetic estrogens are capable of inducing a high incidence of renal carcinomas  in this species. A high incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas can also be  induced in the hamster with synthetic estrogens such as ethinyl estradiol or  diethylstilbestrol, provided alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) is present in the diet.  Although steroid receptor-mediated hormonal events appear to be intimately  involved in the process of in vivo cell transformation of both tissues, certain  observations strongly suggest that nonhormonal events are also important. Despite  their potent estrogenic activity at the doses used, ethinyl estradiol and  alpha-zearalanol induce relatively low renal tumor incidences after 9.0 and 10.0  months of continuous treatment, respectively. A role for the metabolism of  estrogens to reactive intermediates is also suggested by studies showing  estrogen-induced renal tumorigenesis can be partially inhibited by concomitant  administration of ANF or ascorbic acid. Consistent with this is the general  correlation between the amount of catechol estrogen formed by a compound, as  mediated by estrogen 2-/4-hydroxylase, and renal carcinogenicity data. Recently,  additional supporting evidence has been obtained from studies involving the  irreversible binding of reactive metabolites of steroidal or stilbene estrogens  to hamster liver microsomal proteins.","1987-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1858-1863","","5","46","","Fed Proc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3030825","","","","Animals; Protein Binding; Biotransformation; Microsomes, Liver/metabolism; Cricetinae; Mesocricetus; Estrogens/*metabolism/toxicity; Estradiol Congeners/toxicity; *Carcinogens; Carcinoma, Renal Cell/chemically induced; Estrogens, Catechol/metabolism; Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The tosylate precursor 3 was  radiolabeled with (18)F and then reacted with 17α‑ethinyl‑estradiol to produce  the final [(18)F]FETE. The physicochemical properties of [(18)F]FETE were tested  in vitro, including determination of the octanol/water partition coefficient,  stability and cellular uptake in MCF-7 (ER-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative)  cells. An ex vivo biodistribution study was performed in normal Sprague Dawley  rats, and in vivo microPET imaging was performed on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231  tumor-bearing mice. The results of biodistribution and PET imaging of [(18)F]FETE  were compared with that of known 16α‑[(18)F]fuoro‑17β‑estradiol ([(18)F]FES).  Radiation dose estimates for [(18)F]FETE were also analyzed. RESULTS: [(18)F]FETE  was obtained in high radiochemical yield (46.59 ± 8.06%) with high radiochemical  purity (>99%) after HPLC purification and high molar activity  (15.45 ± 3.15 GBq/μmol). [(18)F]FETE is a moderate lipophilic compound with good  in vitro stability and the total synthesis time was 55 to 65 min. In  biodistribution studies, [(18)F]FETE showed high uptake in the ER-abundant  uterine tissue of normal immature SD rats (8.55 ± 1.21 and 6.83 ± 1.70%ID/g at  1 h after intravenous and intraperitoneal injection, respectively), and could be  blocked with estradiol effectively (the uterus uptake was decreased to  0.63 ± 0.35%ID/g at 1 h after iv injection). MicroPET imaging of tumor-bearing  mice with [(18)F]FETE at 1 h after iv injection revealed considerable uptake in  ER-positive MCF-7 tumors (4.63 ± 0.73%ID/g) that could be inhibited  (1.47 ± 0.29%ID/g) and low uptake in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 tumors  (1.97 ± 0.36%ID/g). [(18)F]FES has relatively low uptake in ER-positive tumor  (0.24 ± 0.19%ID/g) when compared with [(18)F]FETE. The adult female effective  radiation dose of [(18)F]FETE in mice was estimated as 0.0022 mSv/MBq.  CONCLUSIONS: A novel 17α‑ethinyl‑estradiol-based ER probe [(18)F]FETE was  developed with high molar activity and good in vitro stability. Based on the  results of bio-evaluation in normal immature rats and tumor-bearing mice, it  might be a promising candidate for specific PET imaging of ER-positive breast  cancer.","2018-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","48-55","","","59","","Nucl Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018.

Carbone17-OH sulfonamide [-O(2)-NH(2)]  substituted esters of E2 (EC508, others) were synthesized and tested for carbonic  anhydrase II (CA-II) binding. CA II in erythrocytes is thought to oppose  extraction of EP from portal vein blood during liver passage. Ovariectomized  (OVX, day minus 14) rats were orally treated once daily from day 1-3. Sacrifice  day 4. Uteri were dissected and weighed. Cholesterol fractions and  angiotensinogen were determined in plasma. Oral E2 and ethinyl estradiol (EE)  generated dose related uterine growth and important hepatic estrogenic effects.  EP induced uterine growth at about hundred-fold lower doses. This was possible  with almost absent effects on plasma cholesterol or angiotensinogen. Preliminary  pharmacokinetic studies with EC508 used intravenous and oral administration in  male rats. Resulting blood levels revealed complete oral bioavailability. Further  high blood- but low plasma concentrations indicated erythrocyte binding of EC508  in vivo as potential mechanism of low extraction at liver passage. Very high  systemic estrogenicity combined with markedly lower or absent adverse hepatic  estrogenic effects is evidence for a systemic release of E2 from sulfonamide EP.  In conclusion, tested oral EP bypass the liver in erythrocytes furnishing  systemic estradiol at hydrolysis. This mechanism avoids the hepatic estrogenic  impact of conventional oral estrogen therapy.","2017-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","305-311","","Pt B","165","","J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been developed in combination  with ethinylestradiol for use as an oral contraceptive (EE/DRSP, Yasmin, Schering  AG, Berlin, Germany). The pharmacokinetic characteristics of drospirenone and  ethinylestradiol have been assessed in healthy female volunteers over a 1-year  period. During each of the 13 treatment cycles, volunteers received the combined  active ingredients for 21 days, followed by a 7-day, tablet-free interval. The  concentrations of the serum proteins, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and  corticoid binding globulin (CBG), were determined at intervals after the  cessation of treatment (day 21) at the end of cycles 1, 6, 9 and 13. Drospirenone  and ethinylestradiol were found to be absorbed rapidly and to reach a peak  concentration in serum 1.5-2.0 h after dosing. Serum concentrations  ofdrospirenone declined, with mean terminal half-lives of 30.8-32.5 h.  Accumulation of both drospirenone and ethinylestradiol was observed within a  treatment cycle, with a mean accumulation ratio of 3.0 for drospirenone and 2.1  for ethinylestradiol. In addition, serum drospirenone concentrations increased  between treatment cycles 1 and 6, but remained steady thereafter, as reflected in  the AUC values determined at the end of treatment cycles 1, 6, 9 and 13. Serum  SHBG and CBG concentrations declined in a biphasic manner after cessation of  treatment at the end of cycle 13, and physiological steady-state concentrations  were reached within 4-6 weeks. In conclusion, drospirenone was absorbed at a  similar rate as other synthetic progestogens contained in various oral  contraceptives, as indicated by similar tmax values. The terminal half-life of  drospirenone was intermediate between those of 19-nortestosterone derivatives  like desogestrel, levonorgestrel or gestodene and C21-progestogens like  cyproterone acetate.

A review of its pharmacology, efficacy and tolerability in combined contraceptive preparations.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199550020-00010","","The newer progestogens gestodene, desogestrel and norgestimate were developed in an attempt to produce agents with more selective progestational activity that  would improve cycle control and minimise metabolic changes and adverse events  while effectively preventing pregnancy. In clinical practice, gestodene is  combined with ethinylestradiol in monophasic or triphasic combined oral  contraceptive preparations. The drug has pharmacokinetic advantages over the  other new progestogens in that it is active per se (the others are prodrugs) and  has high bioavailability (approximately 100%). The ability of  gestodene-containing oral contraceptives to inhibit ovulation is similar to that  of preparations containing other progestogens although the required dosage is  lower. In common with oral contraceptives containing desogestrel or norgestimate,  and in contrast with those containing levonorgestrel, gestodene-containing  preparations are associated with neutral or positive changes in lipid and  carbohydrate metabolism. The effects of gestodene preparations on coagulation  parameters, like those of desogestrel and levonorgestrel, are balanced by changes  in the fibrinolytic system. Although the impact of these changes on clinical  cardiovascular end-points has not been determined, the altered lipid profile is  not likely to have significant clinical relevance because of the predominantly  thrombogenic nature of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users.  Pregnancy rates and Pearl Indices with gestodene-containing preparations are low  and similar to those with preparations containing other progestogens. Most  pregnancies are attributable to user failure. Cycle control appears to be better  with gestodene preparations than with levonorgestrel preparations, and available  data suggest that cycle control may also be better with monophasic  gestodene/ethinylestradiol than with monophasic desogestrel- or  norgestimate-containing preparations, and better with triphasic gestodene- than  with triphasic levonorgestrel- or norgestimate-containing preparations. However,  differences between the new progestogen-containing preparations need to be  confirmed in further large-scale trials. The most common adverse events with  gestodene/ethinylestradiol are headaches and breast tension; the incidence of  short term adverse events, including acne, is similar to that with preparations  containing other progestogens. Changes in blood pressure and bodyweight are  negligible. There are no comparative data on the incidence of cardiovascular  events with gestodene-containing and other combined preparations. While the risk  of breast cancer appears to be increased with long term combined oral  contraceptive use in certain patient subgroups, this risk needs to be balanced  against the noncontraceptive benefits of these preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED  AT 400 WORDS)","1995-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","364-395","","2","50","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8521763","","","","Humans; Female; Lipid Metabolism; Drug Interactions; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tissue Distribution; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Absorption; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Endometrium/drug effects; Ovulation/*drug effects; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Menstrual Cycle/*drug effects; Hemostasis/drug effects; Norpregnenes/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Receptors, Progesterone/drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estrogens in general have not produced PLLs; for ethinyl  estradiol the situation is equivocal. The steroids which increase the incidence  of PLLs have not been shown to have the characteristics usually associated with  classical hepatocarcinogens such as diethylnitrosamine (e.g. negative  mutagenicity and cytoxicity, failure to bind covalently to DNA). Therefore,  another mechanism must be assumed. A possible explanation is given by the ability  demonstrated for a few steroids (mestranol alone or in combination with  norethindrone, ethinylestradiol) to promote preneoplastic islands induced by  diethylnitrosamine, resulting in an increase in tumor incidence over rats given  only the carcinogen. Spontaneous preneoplastic islands in rats occur in various  incidence in different strains and we have recently shown that their reaction to  steroids-enhanced proliferation-is the same as the effect on preneoplastic  islands produced by classical carcinogens. Sex steroids also enhance the growth  or normal hepatocytes. It, therefore, seems reasonable to assume that sex  steroids produce PLLs by acting on spontaneous preneoplastic lesions and not by  the mechanisms usually associated with classical carcinogens. Extrapolating the  incidence of PLLs in rats to a risk in humans may be highly misleading because of  different pharmacokinetic patterns. Even in rats treated orally for two years  with sex steroids dosed as multiples of the human contraceptive dose, resorption  and biovailability may vary by a factor of 10 or more. It is, therefore,  inappropriate to state that one sex steroid is more active in the production of  PLLs than another, unless the data from pharmacokinetic studies are taken into  account. Available evidence shows that sex steroids act as tumor promotors and  enhance the growth of normal hepatocytes. It is extremely doubtful whether a sex  steroid producing PLLs in the rat after two years of oral treatment can be  classified as an initiating tumorigen for the rat. Substantial risk for humans  cannot be inferred, because of the high incidence of spontaneous preneoplastic  lesions in rats, and because of the very high sensitivity of the rat liver to a  variety of chemically unrelated compounds including sex steroids.","1982-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","132-143","","2","10","","Toxicol Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28094732","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES: A literature  search was performed using MEDLINE to identify articles published between January  1980 and July 1995 concerning the drug interactions of macrolides. Published  abstracts were also examined. All studies using dirithromycin were performed  under the sponsorship of Eli Lilly and Company. DATA SYNTHESIS: Erythromycin, the  first macrolide discovered, is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.  By decreasing their metabolism, erythromycin can interact with other drugs  metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. The lack of such interactions would  be a desirable feature in a newer macrolide. We describe studies performed to  detect any interactions of dirithromycin with cyclosporine, theophylline,  terfenadine, warfarin, and ethinyl estradiol. The studies showed that  dirithromycin, like azithromycin, is much less likely to cause the interactions  detected with clarithromycin and erythromycin. A review of the literature showed  differences among macrolides in their abilities to inhibit cytochrome P450  enzymes and, thus, to cause drug-drug interactions. Erythromycin and  clarithromycin inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, and have been implicated in  clinically significant interactions. Azithromycin and dirithromycin neither  inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes nor are implicated in clinically significant  drug-drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Dirithromycin, a new macrolide, does not  inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The concomitant use of dirithromycin  with cyclosporine, theophylline, terfenadine, warfarin, or ethinyl estradiol was  studied in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. In vitro, dirithromycin  did not bind cytochrome P450. In healthy subjects, erythromycin increases the  clearance of cyclosporine by 51%, whereas dirithromycin causes no significant  changes in the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine. In kidney transplant recipients,  administration of dirithromycin was associated with a significant (p < 0.003)  decrease of 17.4% in the clearance of cyclosporine. In patients taking low-dose  estradiol, the administration of dirithromycin caused a significant (p < 0.03)  increase of 9.9% in the clearance of ethinyl estradiol; escape ovulation did not  occur. Unlike erythromycin and clarithromycin, dirithromycin had no significant  effects on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, terfenadine, or warfarin. The  alterations typical of drug interactions that are based on inhibition of the  cytochrome P450 system occurring with erythromycin and clarithromycin were not  observed with dirithromycin.","1997-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","349-356","","3","31","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9066944","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Interactions; Drug Combinations; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Macrolides; Anti-Bacterial Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Erythromycin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These data are compared to that derived from less complex predictions based on  octanol-water partition coefficient and molecular connectivity index. The model  predicted that bioaccumulation of steroid estrogens occurred in all organisms,  however, the values were small, and the maximum and minimum bioaccumulation  factors in this study were found in the fish at the lowest trophic level with  ethinylestradiol (332) and the fish at the highest trophic level with estriol  (1.8), respectively. Moreover, the bioaccumulation factors were sensitive to the  metabolic rates of the estrogens in the free living organisms, while the  concentration of estrogens in sediment was a significant factor in determining  these values in benthic invertebrates. Biomagnification contributed little to the  overall bioaccumulation, but the importance increased in fish exposed to  ethinylestradiol. The predicted bioaccumulation factors from the food web model  were generally smaller than the calculated bioconcentration factors from the  simpler octanol-water partition coefficient/molecular connectivity index based  estimates. Compared to literature measured data, the predicted values for fish  were approximately 1000 times less than the values observed in laboratory tests,  while for invertebrates, the modeled values were less than two orders of  magnitude below laboratory results. However, the model predicted a similar  bioconcentration factor for plankton in relation to experimental data for  Chlorella vulgaris for estrone and estriol.","2002-04-22","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","159-168","","1-3","289","","Sci Total Environ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 12049392","","","","Animals; Tissue Distribution; Forecasting; *Models, Theoretical; Environmental Exposure; Body Burden; *Fishes; Estrogens/*pharmacokinetics; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*pharmacokinetics; Estradiol Congeners/*pharmacokinetics; *Food Chain; *Invertebrates; *Plankton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA  SOURCES: MEDLINE and Lexis/Nexis Medical Library searches for 1966-1999 using the  key word ""oral contraceptives,"" cross-indexed with the terms ""antibiotics,""  ""adverse effects,"" and ""pregnancy,"" and MEDLINE search using the additional MeSH  term ""drug interactions."" No language restrictions were used. METHODS OF STUDY  SELECTION: A total of 167 articles were retrieved for analysis. Another 32  articles were identified by review of the references cited in these publications.  Articles were selected based on their ability to provide information on the  relationship between antibiotic therapy and OC efficacy in otherwise compliant  users (defined as women with unplanned pregnancies who reported compliance with  their OC regimen). Additionally, studies that either directly measured the  effects of antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of OC components, or that analyzed  the effects of antibiotics on measures of ovulation in OC users were accepted.  TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: At least 30 cases have been reported of  pregnancies occurring in women taking OCs and antibiotics, particularly rifampin.  Approximately 20% of pregnant women reporting to family planning or abortion  clinics reported concomitant OC and antibiotic use. Information from adverse  event reporting databases generally mirrors the types of information gleaned from  these case reports and clinical surveys and accounts for approximately one-third  of reported cases. Retrospective surveys, primarily from dermatology-based  practices, also have reported 24 pregnancies in OC users who concomitantly  received therapy with antibiotics, most commonly tetracyclines and penicillins.  Apparent OC failure rates in clinical surveys were within the usual range  expected for patterns of typical use. In pooled results obtained from relatively  small populations, oral antibiotics, with the exception of rifampin, have not  significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel,  and norethindrone or reduced the serum concentrations of gonadotropins. However,  individual patients have been identified who experienced significant decreases in  the plasma concentration of these components of OCs and who appeared to ovulate.  CONCLUSION: Rifampin impairs the effectiveness of OCs. Pharmacokinetic studies of  other antibiotics have not shown any systematic interaction between antibiotics  and OC steroids. However, individual patients do show large decreases in the  plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain other  antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives. Because it is not  possible to identify these women in advance, a cautious approach is advised.","2001-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","853-860","","5 Pt 1","98","","Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11704183","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Pregnancy; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Rifampin/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  here compared the response of serum adiponectin and leptin levels to the  amelioration of androgen excess by means of treatment with an antiandrogenic oral  contraceptive pill, as compared with the response to insulin sensitization with  metformin. Thirty-four women presenting with PCOS were randomized to treatment  with an oral contraceptive containing 35 microg ethinyl-estradiol plus 2 mg  cyproterone acetate (Diane(35) Diario) or with metformin (850 mg twice daily).  Serum adiponectin and leptin levels were evaluated at baseline and after 12 and  24 weeks of treatment. In obese PCOS women, treatment with Diane(35) Diario  resulted in an increase in serum adiponectin levels and in the adiponectin/leptin  ratio, in parallel with a marked decrease in serum androgen concentrations,  whereas no statistically significant changes were observed during treatment with  metformin.

Patients continued taking their protocol-permitted  co-medications while receiving the 3D ± ribavirin regimen. The effects of the  co-medications on exposures of the 3D regimen and ribavirin were examined.  METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic model-predicted steady-state area under the  curve (AUC(24,ss)) values were evaluated in the presence/absence of the  co-medications. Interactions resulting in a greater than 50% reduction or 100%  increase in an AUC(24,ss) value were examined as covariates for an effect on  apparent clearance (CL/F). RESULTS: More than 1,200 co-medications belonging to  15 drug classes and/or 19 enzyme and transporter inhibitor and/or inducer  categories were used concomitantly with the 3D regimen in the trials.  Approximately 1,500 patients (65%) in Phase III trials received two or more  co-medications from multiple drug classes or categories. No co-medication  class/category decreased or increased ombitasvir, dasabuvir, ritonavir or  ribavirin AUC(24,ss) by more than half or twofold, respectively. Opioids,  antipsychotics, anti-epileptics, antidiabetics and non-ethinyl  estradiol-containing hormone replacement therapies appeared to have an effect  (AUC(24,ss) ratio ≤0.5 or ≥2.0) on paritaprevir exposures. However, when these  classes were included in the paritaprevir population pharmacokinetic model, only  opioids and antidiabetics had a statistically significant effect on CL/F, but  with no clinically meaningful increase in exposures (≤55%). CONCLUSIONS: No dose  adjustment is necessary for the 3D ± ribavirin regimen when used with the  co-medications included in this analysis as there were no clinically meaningful  effects on exposures of the DAAs.","2016","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:37:40","","707-714","","8","21","","Antivir Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27584548","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Valine; Drug Therapy, Combination; Cyclopropanes; 2-Naphthylamine; Lactams, Macrocyclic; Proline/analogs & derivatives; HIV Infections/*drug therapy; Carbamates/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Anilides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Ritonavir/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Macrocyclic Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Ribavirin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Uracil/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human  exposure to low doses of endogenous estrogens, estrogenic drugs, phytoestrogens,  and xenoestrogens has the potential to improve health or disrupt normal endocrine  activity, as well as impact the diverse systems with which estrogens interact,  including the cardiovascular system, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.  Mechanisms of action and diversity of adverse and non-adverse effects following  human exposure to low doses of estrogen active chemicals (EACs, defined as  chemicals which interact with an estrogen receptor [ER]) are poorly understood.  This review summarizes our current understanding of the pharmacological action  with a focus on pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicokinetics (TK) of several  representative EACs in both physiological and pathological processes. The goal of  this review is to assess the current state-of-the-science on: (i) the potential  for EACs to interfere with endocrine activity, (ii) factors which contribute to  endocrine-related clinical outcomes, and (iii) existing knowledge gaps. While  classical PK approaches (compartmental or non-compartmental) can be used to  characterize absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of EACs, many  of the detailed pharmacological characteristics necessary to understand  benefit-risk balance have not yet been clarified. Pharmacological complexities  mirror the complexity of determining whether and under what conditions exposure  to estrogens in drugs, foods or to xenoestrogenic chemicals are beneficial or  harmful to human health.","2014-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","696-724","","8","44","","Crit Rev Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25099693","","","","Humans; Animals; pharmacokinetics; Environmental Exposure/adverse effects; bisphenol A; pharmacodynamics; physiologically based pharmacokinetics; Xenobiotics/pharmacokinetics/toxicity; genistein; Toxicokinetics; ethinyl estradiol; estradiol; conjugated estrogens; daidzein; daidzin; Endocrine Disruptors/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity; equol; Estrogens/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; genistin; Phytoestrogens/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; Receptors, Estrogen/*drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studies have not  identified the type of formulations used by the women, and there are no data on  the effect of progestins on 25(OH)D levels. Our study objective was to compare  the effects of two COC formulations [ethinyl estradiol (EE)/norethindrone acetate  (NETA) vs. EE/levonorgestrel (LNG)] as well as LNG alone on total and  bioavailable (free plus albumin-bound) 25(OH)D levels in serum samples collected  at baseline, mid treatment, and end of treatment. Total 25(OH)D and VDBP were  measured by immunoassay, and bioavailable 25(OH)D was calculated. The results  show that with the EE/NETA formulation, total and bioavailable 25(OH)D and VDBP  levels increased non-significantly by 7.4 %, 14.9 %, and 10 %, respectively, from  baseline to end of treatment. In contrast, the corresponding changes with EE/LNG  showed an increase of 4.4 % in total 25(OH)D but a significant decrease of 18.2 %  in bioavailable 25(OH)D and increase of 19.1 % in VDBP. When LNG was administered  alone, no significant changes were observed in total and bioavailable 25(OH)D or  VDBP levels during the course of treatment. Our findings show considerably  different effects on total and bioavailable 25(OH)D levels, as well as VDBP  levels, with different oral contraceptive formulations. LNG may have a  suppressive effect on VDBP, similar to its well-known androgenic effect on SHBG.  Further studies are needed to determine the effect of hormonal contraceptive  formulations on vitamin D status and its potential impact on women's health.","2021-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","105879","","","211","","J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

METHODS: In the  bioavailability study, E(4) was administered as a single dose of 0.05, 0.5 or 5.0  mg/kg orally or subcutaneously to female rats. Plasma was analyzed using an  LC-MS/MS method. The bone study was conducted in 3-month-old female rats assigned  to the following seven treatment groups of ten animals each: no treatment;  sham-operated + vehicle; bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) + vehicle; OVX + E(4)  0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/kg/day and OVX + EE 0.1 mg/kg/day. Once-daily treatment by  oral gavage was given for 4 weeks and the following measurements were performed:  serum osteocalcin, bone mineral density, bone mineral content and bone mineral  area of lumbar vertebrae L3-L6, peripheral quantitative computed tomography of  the left tibiae and the biomechanical properties of the distal femora. RESULTS:  Oral bioavailability of E(4), relative to that of subcutaneous dosing, was 70%  and above at the 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg doses based on the AUC(0-t last).  Subcutaneous dosing provided significantly higher E(4) levels at the 1-h time  point only, and was comparable to oral dosing after 0.5, 2, 4 and 8 h. In the  bone study, E(4) dose-dependently and significantly (1) inhibited the OVX-related  increase in osteocalcin levels, (2) increased bone mineral density and content,  and (3) increased bone strength, all attenuated by ovariectomy. In this rat  model, the relative potency of the highest dose of E(4) (2.5 mg/kg/day) was  comparable to the EE dose, used as positive control. CONCLUSIONS: Estetrol  exhibits high oral bioavailability in the rat, a species considered relevant for  pharmacological studies that are predictive for effects on human bone. Oral  administration of E(4) conveys dose-dependent bone-sparing effects of  high-quality bone in estrogen-depleted OVX rats. Based on its bone-sparing  effects, its oral bioavailability and its preclinical safety and efficacy  profile, E(4) may be superior to other estrogens and is a potential drug for the  prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.","2008","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:27:05","","2-14","","","11 Suppl 1","","Climacteric","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18464016","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Intestinal Absorption; Biological Availability; Random Allocation; Bone Density/*drug effects; Osteocalcin/blood; Injections, Subcutaneous/veterinary; *Ovariectomy; Bone and Bones/*drug effects/metabolism; Bone Density Conservation Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Estetrol/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also  measured cholesterol in HDL and its subfractions and postheparin lipoprotein  lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase activities. Plasma decay of retinyl  palmitate was biexponential. The rapid component, reflecting chylomicron remnant  removal, accounted for about 90% of the total clearance in all studies.

The contraceptive  effect also can be impaired using barbiturates and rifampicin; the demand of  insulin or oral antidiabetics can be altered during medication with oral  contraceptives. Regarding investigations of possible drug interactions only few  studies have been performed with hormonal replacement therapy in peri- and  postmenopause. Drug interactions could develop above all treating risk patients  with internal diseases. Treatment regimens using the physiological, human hormone  estradiol instead of conjugated equine estrogens should be preferred.

Cyclic ovarian estradiol secretion is associated with a bone-saving and vascular protection  effect. Endogenous progesterone does not modify the vasodilator effect of  oestrogens. At physiological concentrations, the natural sex steroids have low  antigonadotropic effects. More potent synthetic derivatives with more  antigonadotropic effects were synthesized in the 1950s. After the menopause,  there is no longer any need to use hormonal steroids as antigonadotropics. In  addition, vascular contraindications are more common in an older population.  Contraceptive steroids (particularly ethinyl estradiol) are therefore rarely  used. The oestrogen that is most widely prescribed for post-menopausal  replacement is a complex formulation of conjugated oestrogens of equine origin  that is administered orally in a single daily dose. Improvements in hormone  replacement therapy may result from the use of parenteral estradiol (providing  sufficient doses are reached) and of a progestogen chemically more similar to  progesterone.","2000-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","200-207","","3","20","","Cephalalgia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10997774","","","","Humans; Female; Contraceptives, Oral/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Estradiol/blood/*pharmacokinetics; *Hormone Replacement Therapy/methods; Estrogens/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Menopause/*blood; Progesterone/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Progestins/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective  observational study. PATIENTS: Fourteen lean normal glucose tolerant patients  with PCOS and 11 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy women.  MEASUREMENTS: Glucagon like peptide 1, glucose and insulin levels were measured  during a standardized meal tolerance test and area under the curves (AUCs) were  calculated. Whereas healthy controls were assessed at baseline, all tests were  repeated in women with PCOS after treatment with ethinyl estradiol  30 μg/drospirenone 3 mg (EE/DRSP) for 3 months. RESULTS: Both fasting and  post-meal levels of GLP-1 were significantly reduced in women with PCOS compared  to controls (P = 0·022 and P = 0·028, respectively). AUC for GLP-1 was also lower  in PCOS (P = 0·012). Glucose and insulin measurements did not show a significant  change between the groups. In the PCOS group, GLP-1, glucose and insulin levels  did not show any change after 3 months of EE/DRSP use. CONCLUSION: GLP-1 levels  both at fasting and in response to a meal are blunted in lean women with PCOS  compared to healthy women. Short term oral contraception do not alter GLP-1  secretion in PCOS. Disturbance in incretin secretion dynamics might contribute to  the risk of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes in PCOS.","2014-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","588-592","","4","81","","Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24730585","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Prospective Studies; Area Under Curve; Young Adult; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Insulin/blood; Fasting/blood; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/*blood/drug therapy; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/*blood; Estradiol/therapeutic use; Androstenes/therapeutic use; Postprandial Period/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tacrolimus was metabolized in vitro by isolated human, pig, and rat small  intestinal microsomes. The metabolites generated were identified by HPLC/MS.  Tacrolimus and its metabolites were quantified using HPLC or HPLC/MS. The  cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes responsible for tacrolimus metabolism in small  intestine were identified using specific CYP antibodies and inhibitors. For  characterization of the interindividual variability, microsomes were isolated  from small intestinal samples of patients who had undergone resection for various  reasons. In an in vitro model using pig small intestinal microsomes, 32 drugs  were analyzed for their interactions with tacrolimus metabolism. After incubation  with human, rat, and pig small intestinal microsomes, the metabolites  13-O-demethyl and 13,15-O-demethyl tacrolimus were identified. The metabolism of  tacrolimus by human small intestine was inhibited by anti-CYP3A, troleandomycin,  and erythromycin, indicating that, as in the liver, CYP3A enzymes are the major  enzymes for tacrolimus metabolism in the human small intestine. Metabolism of  tacrolimus by small intestinal microsomes isolated from 14 different patients  varied between 24 and 110 pmol/13-O-demethyl tacrolimus/min/mg microsomal  protein, with a mean +/- SD of 54.2 +/- 29.2 pmol/min/mg. Of 32 drugs tested, 15  were found to inhibit small intestinal tacrolimus metabolism: bromocryptine,  corticosterone, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, ergotamine, erythromycin, ethinyl  estradiol, josamycin, ketoconazole, nifedipine, omeprazole, progesterone,  rapamycin, troleandomycin, and verapamil. All of these drugs inhibited tacrolimus  metabolism by human liver microsomes as well. It is concluded that tacrolimus is  metabolized by cytochrome CYP3A enzymes in the small intestine. The rate of the  CYP3A enzymatic activities varies about 5 times from patient to patient, and  drugs that interfere with the in vitro metabolism of tacrolimus in the liver also  inhibit its small intestinal metabolism.","1995-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1315-1324","","12","23","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8689938","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; In Vitro Techniques; Species Specificity; Drug Interactions; Biotransformation; Mass Spectrometry; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism; Swine; Microsomes, Liver/enzymology/metabolism; Immunoblotting; Immunosuppressive Agents/*metabolism; Intestine, Small/enzymology/*metabolism; Microsomes/enzymology/metabolism; Tacrolimus/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The similarity to NET is reflected in the high endometriotropy  and in similar pharmacokinetics like short plasma half-live and high  bioavailability. However, DNG also elicits properties of progesterone derivatives  like neutrality in metabolic and cardiovascular system and considerable  antiandrogenic activity, the latter increased by lack of binding to SHBG as  specific property of DNG. It has no glucocorticoid and antimineralocorticoid  activity and has no antiestrogenic activity with the consequence that possible  beneficial estradiol effects should not be antagonized. This may be of special  importance for the tolerability and safety of the first pill with estradiol  valerate instead of ethinylestradiol, although well-designed postmarketing  studies are still ongoing to demonstrate what can be expected on the basis of  pharmacology.","2010-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","109-113","","2","26","","Gynecol Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19672744","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Endometrium/drug effects; Contraceptive Agents, Female/chemistry/*pharmacology; Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology; Nandrolone/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the effects of estrogen replacement on measures of  calcium absorption, retention, and bone turnover, we studied a group of seven  hypogonadal girls with Turner's syndrome (mean +/- SE age, 12.5 +/- 0.7 years).  At baseline, 42Ca intravenously (IV) and 44Ca orally were administered, and blood  and urine samples were collected for approximately 130 hours. Estrogen therapy  was begun as oral ethinyl estradiol (4 or 20 micrograms/d) or intramuscular depot  estradiol given over 4 weeks, after which an identical study was repeated.  Analysis of calcium enrichment in blood and urine was performed using mass  spectrometry methods. After estrogen therapy, there was a significant increase in  calcium absorption ([Va] P = .03) and total calcium retention ([Vbal] P = .04),  similar to the effects of testosterone in boys. Bone accretion (Vo+) decreased  after estrogen therapy (P = .004), as did resorption ([Vo-] P = .004). The  overall rate of whole-body calcium turnover (Vt) was significantly decreased  after estrogen administration (P = .04). These findings were opposite of those  observed in prepubertal boys treated with testosterone. The contribution of bone  resorption to whole-body turnover (E) also decreased after estrogen therapy (P =  .05). These changes were associated with increased levels of  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D after therapy with estrogens (P = .05). We conclude that  estrogen supplementation is significantly anabolic for calcium metabolism by  markedly increasing calcium absorption and retention and diminishing the  estimated whole-body calcium turnover in girls with severe hypogonadism and  Turner's syndrome. Further studies assessing the dietary calcium and/or vitamin D  intake and bone mineral density of hypogonadal girls whose estrogen replacement  is intentionally delayed will further define the need for calcium or vitamin D  supplements in the peripubertal years in this condition.","1997-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","908-913","","8","46","","Metabolism","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9258273","","","","Humans; Female; Treatment Outcome; Child; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism; *Intestinal Absorption; Growth Hormone/blood; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood; Vitamin D/therapeutic use; Estrogens/*administration & dosage; Bone Regeneration/*drug effects; Calcium/*metabolism/therapeutic use; Turner Syndrome/*drug therapy/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is conceivable  that the oral administration of gram quantities of vitamin C could also interfere  with the sulfation of levonorgestrel (LNG) metabolites during phase II  biotransformation, because sulfates represent a major part of the conjugated  metabolites of LNG in the serum. This possible interaction was investigated in  the aforementioned study, comparing Cmax and AUC(0-12h) values of LNG on the  first and 15th day of two successive treatment cycles with and without  co-medication of vitamin C. In addition, the serum protein binding of LNG and the  concentration of the binding proteins SHBG and CBG were compared between both  treatments. Corresponding parameters obtained during treatment with the oral  contraceptive alone and during co-administration of vitamin C were evaluated  statistically for possible differences. No effect of vitamin C was observed for  any of the parameters investigated. Thus, the repeated oral administration of  gram quantities of vitamin C does not impair the sulfation of hydroxylated  metabolites of LNG. There was also no observable effect on the serum protein  binding of LNG and the concentrations of SHBG and CBG in the serum. The results  obtained in this study population (American women) for LNG are in good agreement  with those obtained from a previous study in European women, who had taken a  combination oral contraceptive containing the same doses of LNG and  ethinylestradiol.","1995-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:34:14","","111-116","","2","51","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7750288","","","","Humans; Female; Biology; Protein Binding; Biological Availability; Europe; Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Oral Contraceptives; Physiology; Germany; Testosterone/blood; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/metabolism; Developed Countries; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Examinations And Diagnoses; Family Planning; Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Vitamins; Blood Proteins/*metabolism; *Clinical Research; *Research Report; *Laboratory Procedures; Contraceptive Agents--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Female--analysis; *Levonorgestrel--analysis; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--analysis; Transcortin/metabolism; *Oral Contraceptives, Combined; Western Europe; *Contraceptives, Oral, Combined; *Ascorbic Acid--pharmacodynamics; Levonorgestrel/*blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label,  three-treatment-period cross-over study to evaluate the effects of NES/E2  transdermal gel on ovulation inhibition, suppression of follicular growth and  pharmacokinetic parameters. The doses were low (1.5 mg NES/0.5 mg E2), medium  (3.0 mg NES/1.0 mg E2) and high (4.5 mg NES/1.5 mg E2). Participants applied gel  daily to a fixed area on the abdomen for 21 consecutive days. They were  interviewed regarding their experiences using the gel. RESULTS: Eighteen  participants were randomized; 16 completed the study. Median NES C(max) values  for low, medium and high dose groups at day 21 were 318.6 pmol/L, 783.0 pmol/L  and 1063.8 pmol/L, respectively. Median maximum follicular diameter was higher  with the lowest dose with 16.2 mm versus 10.0 and 10.4 mm with the medium and  high doses, respectively. Among adherent participants, ovulation was inhibited in  all dose groups, except for one participant in the medium dose (6.7%) that had  luteal activity and an ultrasound image suggestive of a luteinized unruptured  follicle. There were few reports of unscheduled bleeding, with more episodes  reported for the lower dose. Adverse events were mild, and no skin irritation was  reported from gel application. CONCLUSION: While all three doses blocked  ovulation effectively and were evaluated as safe and acceptable, the medium dose  was considered the lowest effective dose based on a more adequate suppression of  follicular development. Further development of this novel contraceptive  delivering NES and E2 is warranted and has potential for improved safety compared  to ethinyl-estradiol-based methods.","2015-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:10","","289-297","","4","92","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The adrenal gland and liver  manifested the greatest amounts of rLDL binding in vivo, but activity also was  found in spleen, lung, kidney, ovary, and intestine. In contrast, little or no  such binding was found utilizing either methyl-rLDL or hLDL. rHDL containing E  apoprotein bound to the same group of tissues although in lesser amounts, except  in the case of ovary and adrenal gland which bound disproportionately greater  amounts of rHDL than rLDL. In keeping with these marked differences in tissue  binding, the clearance of rLDL from the plasma equaled 847 +/- 36  microliters/h/100 g of rat while that of methyl-rLDL and hLDL was only 368 +/- 8  and 363 +/- 11 microliters/h/100 g of rat, respectively. When the steady state  plasma level of rLDL was raised 2.5-fold, the clearance decreased slightly to 705  +/- 20 microliters/h/100 g of rat. The clearance of hLDL remained constant,  however, at about 350 microliters/h/100 g of rat even when the plasma hLDL level  was raised to very high values. The clearance of rHDL and hHDL equaled 644 +/- 16  and 408 +/- 13 microliters/h/100 g of rat, respectively, reflecting the more  similar rate of binding of rHDL and hHDL to the tissues of the rat. Rates of  whole animal sterol synthesis were lowered from 28 mumol/h to 8.8 mumol/h or 13  mumol/h by fasting and cholesterol feeding, respectively, and stimulated to 71  mumol/h by cholestyramine treatment. Under these same conditions, hepatic  cholesterol synthesis could be lowered from the normal rate of 15 mumol/h to 4.2  mumol/h and raised to 50 mumol/h. None of these treatments, however, affected the  plasma clearance of rLDL and rHDL. In contrast, treatment with ethinyl estradiol  increased by 3-fold both the hepatic binding and the whole animal plasma  clearance of rLDL. Following resection of approximately two-thirds of the liver  under carefully controlled metabolic conditions, there was no change in the rate  of hepatic cholesterol synthesis or rLDL binding in the remaining liver, but the  clearance of chylomicrons, rLDL, and rHDL diminished by 67%, 26%, and 17%,  respectively, suggesting that in the rat the liver was responsible for the  degradation of approximately 97%, 39%, and 27%, respectively, of these  lipoprotein fractions.","1982-07-25","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:33:13","","8061-8072","","14","257","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6282871","","","","Humans; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Species Specificity; Cholesterol, HDL; Receptors, LDL; Tissue Distribution; Liver/metabolism; Sterols/metabolism; Cholesterol/metabolism; Cholestyramine Resin/pharmacology; Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism; Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism; Lipoproteins, HDL/*metabolism; *Carrier Proteins; *RNA-Binding Proteins; *Receptors, Lipoprotein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drospirenone counteracts the estrogen-induced stimulation of the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and blocks testosterone from binding to  androgen receptors. Because of these characteristics, it has the potential to  reduce body weight, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein levels and to  enhance high-density lipoprotein levels. As a combination oral contraceptive,  drospirenone with ethinyl estradiol is effective and has positive effects on  weight and lipid levels. Additionally, it relieves menstrually related symptoms  (e.g., negative affect and water retention) that are commonly observed with other  combination oral contraceptives.

Previously, a novel approach [the relative induction score (RIS)] was developed  using the Fa2N-4 immortalized human hepatocyte line and proposed as a tool for  predicting magnitude of clinical DDIs caused by induction of CYP3A. The approach  is based on combining in vitro induction parameters (EC(50) and E(max)) with the  efficacious free plasma concentrations to calculate a relative induction score,  which is correlated to the magnitude of clinical DDI for midazolam or ethinyl  estradiol. To expand the applicability of the RIS model, we have measured  induction caused by ten drugs in two different lots of human cryopreserved  hepatocytes and correlated the data to clinical DDIs using the RIS. The results  demonstrated that, as with Fa2N-4 hepatocytes, sigmoidal relationships can be  derived between RIS and magnitude of induction of midazolam and ethinyl estradiol  clearance in cryopreserved human hepatocytes.

Human liver  microsomes could be used for this study, because the metabolite profile matched  that found in human blood. The apparent affinity (KM) of IMM for the cytochrome  P450 proteins (5.1 +/- 1.8 microM) is similar to that of cyclosporin A (CSA). CSA  competitively inhibited the metabolism of IMM, increasing the KM 2- and 4.6-fold  in the presence of 4 and 10 microM CSA, respectively (Ki 3.8 +/- 1.1 microM).  Ketoconazole exhibited competitive inhibition kinetics toward IMM  biotransformation, increasing the KM of IMM 1.8-fold at 0.5 microM ketoconazole  and 3.5-fold at 1 microM ketoconazole, with no effect on Vmax (Ki of 0.5 +/- 0.4  microM). These results indicate that both CSA and ketoconazole would cause drug  interactions, interfering with the biotransformation of IMM. The metabolism of  IMM was also greatly inhibited (approximately 80%) by the CYP3A suicide substrate  triacetyloleandomycin and a CYP3A inhibitory antibody, indicating the involvement  of CYP3A proteins in the biotransformation of IMM. Confirmation of CYP3A4  involvement in the formation of the three primary IMM metabolites was  demonstrated with recombinant cells expressing human CYP3A4. Therefore, compounds  interacting with CYP3A proteins are expected to cause drug-drug interactions  (i.e. the antimycotics ketoconazole and clotrimazole, the steroids  ethinylestradiol and testosterone, the ergots, the calcium channel blocker  nifedipine, and the immunosuppressants FK-506 and rapamycin).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED  AT 250 WORDS)","1995-03","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","321-326","","3","23","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7628296","","","","Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1; Humans; Animals; Biotransformation; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism; Mixed Function Oxygenases/*metabolism; Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Microsomes, Liver/enzymology/*metabolism; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cyclosporins/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After a single dose of 100 mg, serum concentrations of progesterone around 50-60  nM and of 20 alpha-hydroxy-4-pregnene-3-one around 5-6 nM were recorded within  1-4 hours and elevated levels persisted for 8-12 hours. There were only minor  changes in 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations and serum levels of  androstenedione and cortisol were unaffected. A significant conversion of  circulating progesterone into deoxy-corticosterone was demonstrated. During  clinical treatment with oral progesterone the individual serum concentrations of  this potent mineralocorticoid were closely correlated to the progesterone  concentrations. This observation could be important as regards the etiology of  certain clinical disorders characterized by fluid retention. According to  competitive binding analyses there was no evidence that progesterone or  medroxyprogesterone acetate could cause significant displacement of cortisol from  corticosteroid-binding globulin during clinical treatment. The effects of natural  and synthetic hormones upon subfractions of high density lipoprotein (HDL)  cholesterol and liver proteins were followed in postmenopausal women during  replacement therapy with various estrogen-progestogen combinations. The total  serum cholesterol level was significantly reduced during treatment with all  estrogen regimens. The concentrations of HDL cholesterol, HDL2 cholesterol,  apolipoprotein A I and A II were increased in a dose-dependent pattern during  unopposed estrogen therapy. The potency of 10 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol was  estimated to be equivalent to 3-4 mg of estradiol valerate. Estrogen effects were  significantly reversed by levonorgestrel 250 micrograms and also by  medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg. During treatment with natural progesterone, no  changes were recorded in HDL cholesterol or its subfractions. As compared with  the lipoproteins, pregnancy zone protein and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)  were found to be more sensitive to the alkylated than to the non-alkylated  estrogen. Both levonorgestrel and medroxyprogesterone acetate clearly reduced  SHBG levels after 3 months, whereas micronized progesterone had no such effect.  While tamoxifen counteracted the therapeutic and metabolic effects of estrogen  the sequential addition of estriol had no apparent influence. Unopposed estrogen  treatment enhanced liver lecithin synthesis along pathway I, i.e. reduced the  amount of stearic acid and increased the amount of palmitic acid. The effects  were dose-dependent and no qualitative differences between ethinyl estradiol and  estradiol valerate were recorded.","1984","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1-37","","","127","","Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Denmark PMID: 6596830","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Administration, Oral; Liver/*metabolism; Lipoproteins/blood; Lipids/blood; Cholesterol, HDL/*blood; Proteins/*metabolism; Menopause; Fatty Acids/analysis; Protein Binding/drug effects; Progestins/pharmacology; Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology; Estradiol Congeners/administration & dosage; Estrogens/*administration & dosage/metabolism; Phosphatidylcholines/blood; Progesterone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

F.","Alternative cyclosporine metabolic pathways and toxicity.","Clinical biochemistry","","0009-9120","10.1016/0009-9120(95)00037-3","","There are some indications from clinical studies (41,43) for aberrant cyclosporine metabolism resulting in formation of potentially toxic metabolites.  When the activity of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes is low, more substrate is  available for hypothetical alternative pathways of cyclosporine. There are  several reasons for low P450 3A activity in a liver graft such as  inter-individual genetic variability (43,49,84), cold ischemia and reperfusion  damage, changes of the P450 activity during cholestasis (85) or other liver  diseases (86), the influence of cytokines (87) and drug interactions such as  inhibition or enzyme induction (88). Furthermore, low concentrations of  cytochrome P450 3A influence the cyclosporine blood trough concentrations. The  P450 3A concentration as estimated by the erythromycin breath test can be used to  calculate the initial cyclosporine dose required to obtain cyclosporine blood  trough concentrations in the therapeutic window (89). In vitro such alternative  pathways comprising 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible (44,46,47) and/or ethinyl  estradiol-inducible cytochrome P450 enzymes (48) could be identified and resulted  in production of cyclized cyclosporine metabolites. The exact identification of  the P450 enzymes involved requires metabolism of cyclosporine using reconstituted  purified enzymes or single P450 enzymes expressed in cell lines. In addition, it  remains to be clarified whether cyclosporine itself or its metabolite AM1 is the  substrate for cyclization. Because cyclized metabolites have a low affinity to  cyclophilin (58,59) they are mainly found in plasma. When more cyclized  metabolites are formed primarily the concentration of cyclosporine metabolites in  plasma increases. The free fraction of cyclosporine at 37 degrees C was found to  be 1%-1.5% (90,91) of the cyclosporine concentration in blood. To date, nothing  is known about the free fraction of cyclosporine metabolites. Because  distribution characteristics of the cyclized metabolites in blood and urine are  different from those of cyclosporine, it can be speculated that the free fraction  of the cyclized metabolites is higher than that of cyclosporine. This might be  reflected by a higher renal clearance resulting in relatively higher  concentrations in urine compared with blood (61; Figure 3). If this is the case,  a shift in the metabolite pattern with increased concentrations of cyclized  metabolites will lead to an overproportional increase of the free fraction of  cyclosporine metabolites. Although it is tempting to assume that cyclization is  the alternative pathway explaining cyclosporine toxicity in patients with low  concentrations of P450 3A enzymes in the liver (Figure 6), this has not yet been  proven and will require not only quantification of P450 3A but of the complete  P450 enzyme pattern in the liver in combination with characterization of the  cyclosporine metabolite pattern by HPLC with special respect to the cyclized  metabolites AM1c and AM1c9. Also, it is still unclear whether or not the cyclized  metabolites contribute to cyclosporine toxicity. At least, it is unlikely that  they are involved in covalent binding to macromolecules in the liver and kidney  (44,71). In a clinical study using an HPLC method which allowed the specific  quantification of 16 cyclosporine metabolites it was shown that the blood trough  concentrations of the cyclized metabolite AM1c9 is elevated during early  nephrotoxicity in liver graft recipients (82) and it was shown in an in vitro  model that AM1c9 increases endothelin production and therefore might have a  negative effect on renal hemodynamics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)","1995-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","547-559","","6","28","","Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8595701","","","","Humans; Animals; Tissue Distribution; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Drug Evaluation; Proteins/metabolism; Kidney/drug effects/metabolism; Cyclosporine/analysis/*metabolism/*toxicity; Immunosuppressive Agents/*metabolism/therapeutic use/*toxicity; Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/metabolism; Microsomes/chemistry/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine the  contribution of adsorption and biotransformation in OMP removal, four reactors  were operated (two biofilters (with biological activity) and two filters (without  biological activity)). In addition, the influence of empty bed contact time  (EBCT), ranging from 0.012 to 3.2d, and type of secondary effluent (anaerobic and  aerobic) were evaluated. Organic matter, ammonium and nitrate were removed in  both biofilters, being their adsorption higher on GAC than on sand. According to  the behaviour exhibited, OMPs were classified in three different categories: I)  biotransformation and high adsorption on GAC and sand (galaxolide, tonalide,  celestolide and triclosan), II) biotransformation, high adsorption on GAC but low  or null adsorption on sand (ibuprofen, naproxen, fluoxetine, erythromycin,  roxythromycim, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, bisphenol A, estrone,  17β-estradiol and 17α-ethinylestradiol), and, III) only adsorption on GAC  (carbamazepine, diazepam and diclofenac). No influence of EBCT (in the range  tested) and type of secondary effluent was observed in GAC reactors, whereas  saturation and kinetic limitation of biotransformation were observed in sand  reactors. Taking into account that most of the organic micropollutants studied  (around 60%) fell into category II, biotransformation is crucial for the  elimination of OMPs in sand biofilters.","2016-05-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","640-648","","","551-552","","Sci Total Environ","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The World Health Organization has listed  estrogens as group 1 carcinogens. These contaminants are of substantial concern  because of potential threats to human health, and aquatic organisms on long-term  exposure. A range of methods, including oxidation, adsorption, electrochemical,  and irradiation techniques have been employed for their remediation from aqueous  systems. However, inadequate removal, toxic sludge generation, high operating  costs, and the requisite for skilled operating and maintenance personnel  commercially hampered the application of many methods. An interesting alternative  treatment approach based on the use of oxidoreductases, particularly laccases,  has recently gained amicability for the biotransformation of emerging pollutants.  The use of immobilized enzymes is more cost-effective from an industrial  perspective due to improved catalytic stability, reusability, reduction of  product inhibition, and easier product separation. This review provides  comprehensive knowledge on the use of laccases in the biodegradation of steroidal  estrogens, including estrone, 17β-estradiol, and 17α-ethinylestradiol with  endocrine-disrupting potency from the environment. After an overview of estrogens  and catalytic properties of laccase, the use of free, as well as immobilized  laccases with a particular emphasis on estrogens removal by laccase-based  fed-batch, packed bed bioreactors, and membrane reactors, is discussed. A  comparison of existing treatment technologies with enzyme technology for the  removal of estrogens from different environmental matrices is made. Lastly, along  with concluding remarks, future research direction aimed at bridging knowledge  gaps for estrogenic compounds removal are also proposed in this very important  research area.","2019-11-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","447-459","","","690","","Sci Total Environ","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study assessed if repeat doses of mavacamten led to a drug-drug  interaction with EE and/or NOR. This was an open-label study in healthy women. In  Period 1, participants received 35 mcg of EE and 1 mg of NOR. In Period 2,  participants received oral loading doses of mavacamten 25 mg on Days 1-2, 15  mg/day on Days 3-17, and 35 mcg of EE and 1 mg of NOR on Day 15. Plasma  concentrations of mavacamten, EE, and NOR were obtained before dosing and up to  72 hours after dosing. For EE only, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model  was used to simulate mavacamten-mediated CYP3A4 induction with EE for various  CYP2C19 phenotypes. In total, 13 women were enrolled (mean age, 38.9 [standard  deviation, 9.65] years). After mavacamten administration, modest increases in  area under the concentration-time curves were observed for both EE and NOR. The  maximum concentrations and half-lives for EE and NOR were not affected by  coadministration with mavacamten. Criteria for bioequivalence were met or nearly  met for EE and NOR exposure with geometric mean ratios between 0.8 and 1.25. All  adverse events were mild. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic model  predicted a less than 15% decrease in EE exposure across CYP2C19 phenotypes.

As the effects of several non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and female sex steroids on CYP1A2 activity in  vitro are unknown, their effects on phenacetin O-deethylation were studied and  compared with the effects of model inhibitors in human liver microsomes, followed  by prediction of their interaction potential with tizanidine in vivo. In vitro,  fluvoxamine, tolfenamic acid, mefenamic acid and rofecoxib potently inhibited  CYP1A2 [the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) < 10 microM].  Ethinyloestradiol, celecoxib, desogestrel and zolmitriptan were moderate (IC(50)  20-200 microM), and etodolac, ciprofloxacin, etoricoxib and gestodene weak  inhibitors of CYP1A2 (IC(50) > 200 microM). At 100 microM, the other tested  NSAIDs and steroids inhibited CYP1A2 less than 35%. Pre-incubation increased the  inhibitory effects of rofecoxib, progesterone and desogestrel. Using the free  portal plasma inhibitor concentration and the competitive inhibition model, the  effect of fluvoxamine and the lack of effects of tolfenamic acid and celecoxib on  tizanidine pharmacokinetics in human beings were well predicted. However, the  effects of ciprofloxacin, rofecoxib and oral contraceptives were greatly  underestimated even when the predictions were based on their total portal plasma  concentration. Besides rofecoxib, and possibly mefenamic acid, other NSAIDs were  predicted not to significantly inhibit CYP1A2 in human beings.

Different mechanisms have been postulated to explain this  observation. The aim of the study was to investigate whether oral contraceptives  such as ethinyloestradiol and progesterone enhance the absorption of  chlorpromazine by means of inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and if this effect is  mainly due to ethinyloestradiol or progesterone or their combination. The Caco-2  cell line was used as an in vitro model to study the effects of these compounds  on the transport of chlorpromazine. Both apical to basolateral (AP-BL) and  basolateral to apical (BL-AP) transport studies were done on chlorpromazine in  combination with different compounds. Ethinyloestradiol enhanced the AP-BL  cumulative transport of chlorpromazine by 11.5% compared to the control group,  which was also statistically significantly higher than the effect caused by  progesterone (0.8%). A combination of these two steroidal hormones enhanced the  cumulative transport of chlorpromazine by only 2.0% compared to the control  group. This indicates the possible existence of separate drug-binding sites for  these two hormones and chlorpromazine on P-gp. The drug-binding site (or  receptor) for progesterone probably interacts allosterically with the binding  site for ethinyloestradiol and thereby decreasing its transport enhancing effects  on chlorpromazine.","2003-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:26:14","","159-165","","2","56","","Eur J Pharm Biopharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 12957628","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Caco-2 Cells; Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/metabolism; Biological Transport/drug effects/physiology; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacokinetics; Chlorpromazine/*pharmacokinetics; Epithelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Potentiation of hepatotoxicity in connection with  tuberculostatic regimes containing rifampicin is well known and this  pharmacokinetic phenomenon also pertains to the combination with other  Cyt-P-450-inducing drugs such as, for instance, anticonvulsants. However, since  the maximum of rifampicin-related Cyt-P-450-inducing effect is limited to the  initial 2-3 weeks of therapy, the hepatotoxic risk triggered by this  rifampicin-related induction may decline during continuation of therapy.

Pharmacological studies rely on quantitation of active triphosphates in  peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This study evaluated the impact of female sex  and contraceptive therapy on zidovudine plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics  and the impact of contraceptive therapy on HIV viral load. METHODS: Serial plasma  and intracellular zidovudine pharmacokinetics following oral and intravenous  dosing were determined in 18 men and 20 women treated with zidovudine. Women  could repeat pharmacokinetics assessment following 2 months oral or injectable  contraceptive therapy. Zidovudine plasma and intracellular mono-, di- and  triphosphate concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass  spectrometry. Plasma and cervical viral loads were determined preceding and  following 2 months of contraceptive therapy in women. RESULTS: Men exhibited  higher area under the concentration versus time curve for intracellular  zidovudine and zidovudine-monophosphate following oral and intravenous dosing and  higher zidovudine triphosphate following oral dosing. There was no difference  between men and women in plasma zidovudine parameters. Furthermore, contraceptive  therapy had no effect on zidovudine plasma or intracellular pharmacokinetics or  on plasma or cervical HIV-1 RNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Using an optimized  pharmacokinetic design, this study indicated men exhibit significantly higher  zidovudine-monophosphate and zidovudine-triphosphate exposure following  zidovudine oral administration, having implications for drug toxicity and overall  tolerance of zidovudine therapy. The lack of an effect of contraceptive therapy  on zidovudine pharmacokinetics is surprising in light of previous pharmacokinetic  studies for drugs eliminated primarily through glucuronidation.

In the future, extensive studies on comparative drug  metabolism need to be done. The increasing number of hepatic adenomas and  neoplasmas in the past ten years in women taking oral contraceptives initiated  studies on metabolism of estrogens. Hydroxylation of ethinylestradiol at C 2 has  been shown to be the key to understand the activation to arene oxides which bind  covalently to nucleic acids and proteins.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of an antiandrogenic  oral contraceptive (OC) on appetite and eating behavior in women with bulimia  nervosa compared to healthy controls. Twenty-one women with bulimia nervosa and  17 healthy controls matched for age and body mass index participated in the  study. Basal and meal-related appetite and secretions of the satiety peptide  cholecystokinin (CCK) and the appetite-stimulating peptide ghrelin were studied  before and after 3 months of treatment with an antiandrogenic OC (30 microg  ethinyl estradiol combined with 3 mg drospirenone). Bulimic behavior was  evaluated in relation to changes in hormone levels. Before treatment, bulimic  women had higher frequency of menstrual disturbances, acne and hirsutism and  higher levels of testosterone but lower meal-related CCK secretion than controls.  OC treatment reduced meal-related hunger and gastric distention in bulimics. CCK  secretion in response to the meal was unchanged in bulimic women but decreased in  the controls. Ghrelin secretion was comparable between groups and did not change  in response to OC treatment. The treatment improved bulimic behavior in relation  to a decline in testosterone levels in the entire group. Our results support the  suggestion that androgens play a role in bulimic behavior. Treatment with an  antiandrogenic OC may serve as a new strategy for treatment of bulimia nervosa  and particularly in those patients with hyperandrogenic symptoms.","2007-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","548-554","","5","32","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17475412","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Case-Control Studies; Reference Values; Area Under Curve; Matched-Pair Analysis; Ghrelin; Eating/drug effects/physiology; Appetite/*drug effects/physiology; Androstenes/*pharmacology; Androgen Antagonists/*therapeutic use; Appetite Regulation/drug effects/physiology; Bulimia Nervosa/blood/*drug therapy; Cholecystokinin/blood/drug effects; Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal/*therapeutic use; Feeding Behavior/*drug effects/physiology; Peptide Hormones/blood/drug effects; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/analysis/drug effects; Testosterone/antagonists & inhibitors/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirteen studies were  conducted to characterize drug-drug interactions for the 3D regimen of OBV,  PTV/r, and DSV and various medications in healthy volunteers to inform dosing  recommendations in HCV-infected patients. METHODS: Mechanism-based drug-drug  interactions were evaluated for gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, carbamazepine,  warfarin, omeprazole, digoxin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin. Drug-drug  interactions with medications commonly used in HCV-infected patients were  evaluated for amlodipine, furosemide, alprazolam, zolpidem, duloxetine,  escitalopram, methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone, and oral contraceptives. Ratios  of geometric means with 90% confidence intervals for maximum plasma concentration  (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were used to  determine the magnitude of interaction. RESULTS: Coadministration with the 3D  regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV resulted in a <2-fold change in mean Cmax and AUC  for most medications and the DAAs, indicating minimal to modest interactions.  Carbamazepine decreased PTV, ritonavir, and DSV exposures substantially, while  gemfibrozil increased DSV exposures substantially. Although coadministration with  ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives resulted in elevated alanine  aminotransferase levels, coadministration with a progestin-only contraceptive did  not. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of medications can be coadministered with the 3D  regimen of OBV, PTV/r, and DSV without dose adjustment, or with clinical  monitoring or dose adjustment. Although no dose adjustment is necessary for the  3D regimen when coadministered with 17 of the 20 medications, coadministration  with gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, or ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives  is contraindicated.","2015-07","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","20-29","","1","63","","J Hepatol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The monophasic (30  micrograms EE + 75 micrograms GSD) and the triphasic formulation (30 micrograms  EE + 50 micrograms GSD/40 micrograms EE + 70 micrograms GSD/30 micrograms EE +  100 micrograms GSD) suppress gonadotropin release and ovarian function profoundly  and inhibit ovulation reliably. The strong anti-estrogenic and progestogenic  effectiveness of GSD is based on the high GSD serum concentrations achieved  during daily intake. Because of the weak androgenic properties of GSD, both  formulations can be characterized as estrogen-dominant with respect to their  hepatic effects. Except for the first cycles, both formulations afford good cycle  control, and the rate of side effects is similar to that with comparable low-dose  oral contraceptives. The levels of total and free androgens and androgen  precursors, as well as of peripheral androgen activity, are significantly  reduced, resulting in a reduced incidence of acne. The concentrations of SHBG and  other serum-binding globulins are elevated considerably, and thyroid function is  almost unaffected. The estrogen-dominant effect on hepatic metabolism of both  formulations also is reflected by a significant increase in the levels of  triglycerides and VLDL, HDL, and some apolipoproteins, while LDL-CH and total CH  remain unchanged. Similar to other low-dose oral contraceptives, the  GSD-containing preparations cause a slight impairment of glucose tolerance that  does not appear to be of clinical relevance. However, a significant increase  exists in pro-coagulatory and fibrinolytic activity that leads to a considerable  stimulation of fibrin turnover. In predisposed women, this may contribute to an  elevated risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic diseases.","1995-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","829-840","","4","38","","Clin Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8616979","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Lipid Metabolism; Biology; Lipids; Physiology; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/analysis; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; Metabolic Effects; Contraceptive Agents--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents--side effects; Contraceptive Agents, Female--side effects; Contraceptive Agents, Female--pharmacodynamics; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--pharmacodynamics; Endocrine System; Hematological Effects; Hemic System; *Literature Review; *Gestodene--pharmacodynamics; *Oral Contraceptives; *Blood Coagulation Effects; *Lipid Metabolic Effects; *Carbohydrate Metabolic Effects; *Contraceptive Effectiveness; *Endocrine Effects; *Gestodene--side effects; Contraceptive Agents, Progestin--side effects; Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Norpregnenes/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Progesterone Congeners/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  synthesis and metabolism of estrogen in estrogen-sensitive organs continue  postmenopausally, albeit at levels substantially reduced from those of  reproductive women. The postmenopausal production of estrogen is genetically  determined. Thus, symptoms of estrogen deprivation will vary among menopausal  women, although all will cease to menstruate. All prescribed estrogens have a  similar class effect and exert their estrogenicity through similar genomic and  nongenomic pathways. However, the source, chemical structure, and composition of  the estrogens most commonly prescribed for menopausal complaints--conjugated  equine estrogens (CEE), micronized 17beta estradiol (E2), and ethinyl estradiol  (EE)--vary in content, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. These variables  are further influenced by dosage and route of administration. The net clinical  effect depends on the type and amount of free bioavailable estrogen derived  exogenously combined with the respective organ's endogenous synthesis of  estrogen. Extrapolation of population- and group-based randomized clinical trials  that evaluate a fixed dose of a standard estrogen preparation over a  predetermined period of time may not be applicable to other products or to  individual women whose biology differs from that of the study population. The  decision to prescribe estrogen therapy for menopausal symptoms should be  considered within the context of the woman's total quality of life healthcare  needs and adjusted over time to ensure maximal efficacy with minimal risk.","2006-03-28","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","85","","1","8","","MedGenMed","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16915215  PMCID: PMC1682006","","","","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; *Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens/*pharmacology; *Menopause/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radiolabelled progestins were  added to hepatocyte suspensions (3 x 10(6) cells/ml) freshly prepared from female  rat, guinea pig, rabbit, dog (beagle) and cynomolgus monkey. Drug level decreases  (NET, LN, GEST) and prodrug conversions (NETO, NGM) were followed by  radiochromatography (HPLC) for 60 min. In the case of NET and NETO the conversion  into ethinyl estradiol (EE2) was quantified by RIA after HPLC separation.  Half-lives of drug level decreases (t1/2), areas under the curves (AUC) and  metabolic clearance rates (MCR) were estimated for all progestins. For NETO and  NGM the percentages of conversion into NET and LN were calculated, respectively,  and levels of EE2 determined in the case of NET and NETO. Rat hepatocytes showed  an extremely high metabolic activity towards NET, LN and GEST resulting in t1/2  values of below 2 min. Respective values for rabbit hepatocytes ranged from 5-8  min, whereas half-lives calculated for liver cells from guinea pig, dog and  monkey were generally above 30 min. A drastic increase in t1/2 was found for NETO  (as compared to NET) in hepatocytes from rat, rabbit and monkey but not from  guinea pig. Dog hepatocytes degraded NETO about 3 times more rapidly than NET.  NGM was degraded much faster than LN in hepatocytes from all species except the  rat. Liver cells from guinea pig and dog seem to be able to metabolize the  3-oxime group much more rapidly than hepatocytes from the other animal species.  The lowest degree of prodrug conversion of 4% was observed for NGM and dog  hepatocytes. Elevated EE2 levels were found in all experiments with NET and NETO.

METHODS: Two two-way, crossover, two-period, randomized, open-label  studies were performed in 20 healthy female subjects, each. In one period (ESL+OC  period), subjects received ESL 800 mg QD in one study and ESL 1200 mg QD in the  other study, for 15 days; concomitantly with the Day 14 ESL dose, an oral single  dose of 30 μg ethinylestradiol and 150 μg levonorgestrel was administered. In the  other period (OC alone), a single dose of 30 μg ethinylestradiol and 150 μg  levonorgestrel was administered. Three weeks or more separated the periods. An  analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences between  pharmacokinetic parameters of 30 μg ethinylestradiol and 150 μg levonorgestrel  following ESL+OC and OC alone, and 90% confidence intervals (90%CI) for the  ESL+OC/OC alone geometric mean ratio (GMR) were calculated. RESULTS: ESL  significantly decreased the systemic exposure to both ethinylestradiol and  levonorgestrel.

Because these drugs are metabolized at least in part by  cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), it is possible that troglitazone induces CYP3A  activity, thereby reducing plasma concentrations of these agents. Known inducers  of CYP3A, such as rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital, increase  the urinary excretion of 6beta-hydroxycortisol and the ratio of  6beta-hydroxycortisol to cortisol. This evaluation examined the effect of  troglitazone on urinary excretion of 6beta-hydroxycortisol and the ratio of  6beta-hydroxycortisol to cortisol as a marker for CYP3A induction. Urine samples  were collected from 11 subjects who completed a study evaluating the effect of  multiple-dose administration of troglitazone 400 mg once daily (days 11-20) on  the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg daily on days 1-20). A  single urine sample was collected at baseline on day 1, and 24-hour urine samples  were collected on days 10 and 20.

The 24-h LDE uptake by different tissues was also measured in  tissue samples excised after the animals had been sacrificed. We found that LDE  plasma kinetics were similar to those described for native LDL [fractional  clearance rate (FCR) of cholesteryl ester, 0.42 +/- 0.11 h-1]. The major site for  LDE uptake was the liver, and the tissue distribution of the LDE injected  radioactivity was as one would expect for LDL. To test whether LDE was taken up  by the specific LDL receptors, the LDE emulsion was injected into rats treated  with 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, which is known to increase the activity of these  receptors; as expected, removal of LDE from the bloodstream increased (FCR = 0.90  +/- 0.35 h-1). On the other hand, saturation of the receptors that remove  remnants by prior infusion of massive amounts of lymph chylomicrons did not  change LDE plasma kinetics. These results indicate that LDE is cleared from  plasma by B,E receptors and not by the E receptors that remove remnants.  Incorporation of free cholesterol into LDE increased LDE plasma clearance.  Incubation studies also showed that LDE incorporates a variety of  apolipoproteins, including apo E, a ligand for recognition of lipoproteins by  specific receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1993-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","691-696","","8","28","","Lipids","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8377582","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Lipid Metabolism; Rats, Wistar; Tissue Distribution; Emulsions; Lipids/blood; Lipoproteins, LDL/blood/*metabolism; Chylomicrons/metabolism; Receptors, LDL/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic review  examined whether the co-administration of SJW and hormonal contraceptives leads  to significant safety or efficacy concerns. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.  METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles of any  comparative study design (clinical or pharmacokinetic) that examined potential  interactions between SJW and hormonal contraceptives in women of reproductive  age. RESULTS: Of the 48 identified articles, four studies met inclusion criteria  and compared use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) alone to the use of COCs  co-administered with SJW. Two studies demonstrated no change in markers of  ovulation, but one study demonstrated increased follicular growth and probable  ovulation when COCs were co-administered with SJW. Three studies demonstrated an  increased risk of breakthrough bleeding with COCs and SJW. Three studies showed  changes in at least one pharmacokinetic parameter that suggested a significantly  decreased exposure to hormone concentrations when COCs were co-administered with  SJW. The only study that did not demonstrate any significant pharmacokinetic  differences examined a SJW product containing a low amount of hypericin.  CONCLUSION: Limited evidence showing increased risk of ovulation and breakthrough  bleeding raises concern for decreased contraceptive efficacy when COCs are  co-administered with SJW. The pharmacokinetic evidence is mixed but suggests that  SJW administration may be associated with weak to moderate induction of the  metabolism of COCs.","2016-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","668-677","","6","94","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

DATA SOURCES: Searches  of PubMed (1966-July 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July  2011) were conducted using the key words estradiol valerate, dienogest, Natazia,  and Qlaira. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were reviewed to identify  additional references. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All identified  studies published in English and involving efficacy and safety of estradiol  valerate/dienogest as an oral contraceptive were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS:  Estradiol valerate/dienogest is a 4-phasic oral contraceptive approved for the  prevention of pregnancy. The 4-phasic design allows for acceptable cycle control  with this hormonal combination. In efficacy trials of estradiol  valerate/dienogest in women aged 18-35 years, the Pearl Index ranged from 0.40 to  1.64, a range comparable to that of other combination oral contraceptives. The  safety profile was also similar to that of other oral contraceptives, with  headache, metrorrhagia, breast tenderness, nausea or vomiting, acne, and weight  gain reported as the most common adverse effects. Menstrual bleeding patterns and  cycle control with estradiol valerate/dienogest were comparable to those of a  monophasic oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel.  Estradiol valerate/dienogest differs from other oral contraceptives in that it  necessitates more stringent dosing guidelines for maximum contraceptive efficacy.  New starts should be on the first day of menses only, and a back-up method of  contraception is required for the first 9 days, as compared to 7 days with other  oral contraceptives. Back-up contraception is usually required for any pill taken  more than 12 hours later than scheduled. CONCLUSIONS: Estradiol  valerate/dienogest is an effective oral contraceptive. Because it has more  stringent start times and requires a longer duration of backup contraception and  stricter adherence, estradiol valerate/dienogest should be reserved for patients  who are intolerant of other combination oral contraceptives.","2011-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1256-1261","","10","45","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21917554","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Combinations; Drug Costs; Contraceptives, Oral/adverse effects/economics/*pharmacology; Estradiol/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/economics/pharmacology; Nandrolone/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/economics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One concern, however, is the increased risk for OC failure with the use  of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme-inducing AEDs, such as phenobarbital,  carbamazepine, phenytoin, felbamate, topiramate, and oxcarbazepine. Felbamate  induces metabolism of only the progestogenic component, whereas topiramate  induces metabolism of only the estrogenic component. There is preliminary  evidence that lamotrigine induces the metabolism of a progestin, levonorgestrel.  It is unclear whether the estrogenic or the progestogenic component is more  clinically important in preventing pregnancy. To ensure maximal pregnancy  prevention, it is therefore recommended that women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs  should receive OCs containing at least 50 mug of ethinyl estradiol and that  low-dose formulations in general should not be used. AEDs that do not induce  cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes, including valproic acid, gabapentin, levetiracetam,  tiagabine, vigabatrin, zonisamide, and pregabalin, do not interact with OCs.  There are no concerns regarding the treatment of seizures or increased pregnancy  risk with the use of OCs and these non-enzyme-inducing AEDs. Lamotrigine levels,  however, are reduced by 50% in the setting of OC use. Therefore, women with  epilepsy taking lamotrigine need to be monitored carefully for seizures when OCs  are started and for toxicity when OCs are discontinued. Dose adjustment to  maintain clinical stability may be necessary in these settings. The placebo or  pill-free week of the OC regimen may also be a period when clinical toxicity can  occur. Even with the considerations discussed in this review, OCs are a  reasonable contraceptive option for women with epilepsy taking AEDs.","2006-12-26","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","S56-58","","12 Suppl 4","67","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17190925","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Lamotrigine; Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesis; Contraceptives, Oral/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Seizures/*drug therapy; Triazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EXPERT OPINION: Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that  segesterone, an absorbable progestin that is used alone or in combination with  ethinyl estradiol (EE) or E(2,) is the CVR of choice at this present time.  Indeed, segesterone has demonstrated safety and efficacy as a CVR and is also an  appropriate option for lactating women, as they are not absorbed orally. However,  good cycle control is important for improved CVR adherence. CVRs that allow the  combination of more than one drug may unravel another multi-purpose use when  combined with microbicides and could provide combined protection to women who  wish to protect themselves from pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection.","2018-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1685-1691","","15","19","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30286682","","","","Humans; Female; segesterone; Contraceptive Devices, Female/*trends; etonogestrel; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Contraceptive Agents, Female/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; menstrual disturbances","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concentration of estradiol,  17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, demeclocycline,  chlortetracycline, cefuroxime, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide were below the  limit of detection in all of the sewage samples collected within this study. Two  different types of diurnal variation pattern were identified in the influent mass  loads of selected antibiotics and hormones that effectively correlate with daily  drug administration patterns and with the expected maximum human hormone release,  respectively. The occurrence of natural hormones and antimicrobials, administered  every 12 hours, shows a daily trend of decreasing contaminant mass load, having  the maximum values in the morning hours. The occurrence of antibiotics, typically  administered every 8 hours, indicates a daily peak value in samples collected  under the highest hydraulic loading. The efficiency of biological removal of both  hormones and antibiotics is shown to be limited. Compared to the values obtained  in the influent samples, increased concentrations are observed in the  biologically treated effluent for trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and  ciprofloxacin, mainly as a result of deconjugation processes. Ciprofloxacin is  shown as the predominant antimicrobial compound in the effluent, and it is  present at quantities approximately 10 fold greater than the total mass of the  other of the compounds due to poor removal efficiency and alternating  solid-liquid partitioning behaviour. Our results suggest that, to increase the  micro-pollutant removal and the chemical dosing efficiency in enhanced tertiary  treatment, significant benefits can be derived from the optimisation of reactor  design and the development of control schemes that accounts for diurnal secondary  effluent micro-pollutant and hydraulic loading patterns.","2010-03-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1915-1924","","8","408","","Sci Total Environ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 20156636","","","","Humans; Biotransformation; Bioreactors; Norway; *Circadian Rhythm; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*metabolism; Waste Disposal, Fluid/*methods; Cities; Hormones/*metabolism; Sewage/*analysis/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In animal models, NOMAC  demonstrated moderate antiandrogenic activity and strong antiestrogenic activity.  In clinical studies, the progestogen was associated with effective suppression of  gonadotropic activity and ovulation in premenopausal women, and a neutral impact  on hemostasis, lipids, and carbohydrate metabolism. In normal and cancerous human  breast tissue, NOMAC has shown favorable effects on estrogen metabolism, and in  human breast cancer cell lines in vitro, it does not stimulate cell  proliferation. The pharmacologic profile of NOMAC suggested that it would be well  suited for combination with a physiologic estrogen in a combined oral  contraceptive (COC), with the aim of achieving effective contraception with good  cycle control and a favorable safety profile. A monophasic COC containing NOMAC  2.5mg and 17β-estradiol (E2) 1.5mg, administered in a 24/4-day regimen, is  currently under clinical investigation. In a phase III study, NOMAC/E2 provided  consistent and robust ovulation inhibition, with contraceptive effects that  compared favorably with those of drospirenone 3mg/ethinyl estradiol (EE) 30 μg.  Investigators for a second phase III study reported less overall impact with  NOMAC/E2 on hemostatic, lipid, inflammatory, and carbohydrate metabolism  parameters than with levonorgestrel 150 μg/EE 30 μg.

A 2 L enzymatic membrane reactor (EMR) was  successfully operated for 100 h with minimal requirements of laccase for the  transformation of estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), and 17α-ethinylestradiol  (EE2)from both buffer solution and real wastewater (filtered secondary effluent).  When the experiments were performed at high and low concentrations of the target  compounds, 4 mg/L and 100 μg/L, not only high removal yields (80-100%) but also  outstanding reduction of estrogenicity (about 84-95%) were attained. When the EMR  was applied for the treatment of municipal wastewaters with real environmental  concentrations of the different compounds (0.29-1.52 ng/L), excellent results  were also achieved indicating the high efficiency and potential of the enzymatic  reactor system. A second goal of this study relied on the identification of the  transformation products to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of estrogens'  transformation by laccase. The formation of dimers and trimers of E1, E2, and  EE2, as well as the decomposition of E2 into E1 by laccase-catalyzed treatment,  has been demonstrated by liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical  ionization (LC-APCI) analysis and confirmed by determination of accurate masses  through liquid chromatography electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry  (LC-ESI-TOF).

After this oral administration, desogestrel was extensively metabolized.  The dosed radioactivity was predominantly ( approximately 60%) excreted via  urine, while about 35% was excreted via the feces. Desogestrel was metabolized  mainly at the C3-, C5-, C6- and C13-CH(2)CH(3) positions. At the C3-position, the  3-keto moiety was found and in addition, 3beta-hydroxy and 3alpha-hydroxy groups  were observed in combination with a reduced Delta(4)-double bond (5alpha-H).  Hydroxy groups were introduced at the C6- (6beta-OH), the C13-ethyl  (C13-CH(2)CH(2)OH) and possibly the C15- (15alpha-OH) position of desogestrel.  Conjugation of the 3alpha-hydroxy moiety with sulfonic acid and conjugation with  glucuronic acid were also major metabolic routes found for desogestrel in  postmenopausal women. The 3-keto metabolite of desogestrel (the biologically  active metabolite) was the major compound present in plasma at least up to 24 h  after administration of the radioactive dose. Species comparison of the metabolic  routes of desogestrel after oral administration indicates that in rats and dogs  desogestrel is also mainly metabolized at the C3-position, similar to what is now  found for postmenopausal women. Most other metabolic routes of desogestrel were  found to differ between species.

Both desogestrel (acting as 3-keto-desogestrel) and  norgestimate (acting mainly through levonorgestrel) are prodrugs. While  nomegestrol is derived from 19-norprogesterone, the other compounds are  19-nortestosterone derivatives: desogestrel, norgestimate and gestodene belong to  the subgroup of 13-ethyl-gonanes with an ethinyl group at C17 alpha, and  dienogest represents an estrane (13-methyl-gonane) with a cyanomethyl group at  C17 alpha. Both dienogest and nomegestrol have antiandrogenic properties. In  proportion to the dose, the highest serum concentrations are observed after  intake of gestodene. When combined with ethinylestradiol, gestodene and  3-keto-desogestrel accumulate in serum during daily treatment because of  slowed-down elimination. This is probably caused both by binding to sex  hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and by inhibition of inactivating enzymes.  Dienogest does not accumulate in serum, although at a dose of 2 mg very high  serum concentrations of dienogest are reached. The most potent progestogens are  gestodene and desogestrel, while the effect of dienogest and nomegestrol on  endometrium and cervix is less, even though in a similar range. As the  ovulation-inhibiting effect is brought about not only by receptor-mediated  interactions but also by a direct inhibition of steroid biosynthesis, dienogest  and nomegestrol are much less effective than gestodene, desogestrel and  norgestimate. Ethinylated progestogens, particularly gestodene, have been  demonstrated to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Both gestodene and desogestrel  may moderately reduce SHBG levels and counteract the stimulating effect of  ethinylestradiol on hepatic serum proteins, while dienogest and nomegestrol have  no influence. Compared with progestogens with androgenic properties which may  restrict the stimulatory action of ethinylestradiol on haemostatic parameters,  the newer progestogens do not seem to be superior with respect to haemostasis.  There are no data on the direct effect of the compounds on the arterial and  venous vessel wall. Due to the less pronounced antagonism on  ethinylestradiol-induced changes in lipid metabolism, the newer progestogens  appear to be beneficial rather than deleterious, although atherosclerosis was  probably not promoted by the older formulations because of the direct effect of  ethinylestradiol on the arterial wall. There is no evidence for a lesser impact  of the newer progestogens on carbohydrate metabolism, which is mostly impaired by  the estrogen component in oral contraceptives. Formulations containing the newer  progestogens are, however, preferable in patients with hyperandrogenaemia, the  symptoms of which may be improved by the suppression of total and free  testosterone and an increase in SHBG; an additional beneficial effect of the  antiandrogenic properties of dienogest or nomegestrol remains to be proven.","1996-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","188-215","","2","51","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8808163","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Biology; Lipids; Physiology; Research Methodology; Studies; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Family Planning; Metabolic Effects; Contraceptive Agents, Female; *Contraceptive Agents, Progestin; *Comparative Studies; Hematological Effects; Hemic System; *Blood Coagulation Effects; *Lipid Metabolic Effects; *Carbohydrate Metabolic Effects; *Contraceptive Mode Of Action; Progestins/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the presence of an  imidazole ring, the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may  interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug  metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, via either induction or  inhibition. With the increasing use of PPIs, their interaction potential gains  therapeutic importance as was the case with the first and second generation of  H2-blockers (cimetidine and ranitidine, respectively). The enhanced selectivity  of pantoprazole to the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase characterizes the new PPI  generation. In contrast to omeprazole, pantoprazole has a low potential to  interact with the cytochrome P450 system in man. In the drug interaction studies  conducted so far, substrates for all relevant cytochrome P450 families involved  in the metabolism of drugs in man were investigated. Pantoprazole did not affect  the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine,  diazepam, diclofenac, digoxin, ethanol, glibenclamide, a hormonal contraceptive  (combination of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine,  phenprocoumon, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin in man. Pantoprazole also  neither induced the metabolism of antipyrine or caffeine, nor increased urinary  excretion of the induction markers D-glucaric acid and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol.  Vice versa, the investigated drugs had no relevant influence on the  pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole.","1996-06","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:39:14","","243-262","","6","34","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8793611","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Pantoprazole; Benzimidazoles/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; 2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles; Omeprazole/analogs & derivatives; *Proton Pump Inhibitors; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Sulfoxides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Benzimidazoles/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Sulfoxides/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, biotransformation kinetics, products, and mechanisms of BPA  undergoing a laccase-producing Trametes hirsuta La-7 metabolism were for the  first time reported. Strain La-7 could completely biotransform ≤0.5 mmol·L(-1)  BPA within 6 d in vivo. Notably, its extracellular crude laccase solution (ECLS)  and intracellular homogenized mycelium (HM) only required 6 h to convert 85.71%  and 84.24% of 0.5 mmol·L(-1) BPA in vitro, respectively. The removal of BPA was  noticeably hampered by adding a cytochrome P-450 inhibitor (piperonyl butoxide)  in HM, disclosing that cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase participated in BPA  oxidation and metabolism. BPA intermediates were elaborately identified by  high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) combined with (13)C stable isotope  ratios (BPA: (13)C(12)-BPA = 0.25: 0.25, molar concentration). Based on the  accurate molecular mass, isotope labeling difference, and relative intensity  ratio of product peaks, 6 versatile metabolic mechanisms of BPA, including  polymerization, hydroxylation, dehydration, bond cleavage, dehydrogenation, and  carboxylation in vivo and in vitro, were confirmed. Germination index values  revealed that inoculating strain La-7 in a BPA-contaminated medium presented no  phytotoxicity to the germinated radish (Raphanus sativus L.) seeds. In vivo,  Mg(2+), Fe(2+), Fe(3+), and Mn(2+) were conducive to BPA removal, but Cd(2+) and  Hg(2+) significantly obstructed BPA elimination. Additionally, strain La-7 also  exhibited high-efficiency metabolic ability toward estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol  (E2), and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), with more than 96.13%, 96.65%, and 100% of  E1, E2, and EE2 having been converted, respectively.

Rilpivirine should be  administered with a meal to optimize bioavailability. Its solubility is pH  dependent. Rilpivirine is primarily excreted via the feces with negligible renal  elimination. Rilpivirine is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.  There is no clinically relevant effect of age, gender, bodyweight, race,  estimated glomerular filtration rate, or hepatitis B/C coinfection status on  rilpivirine pharmacokinetics in adults. Drug-drug interactions were investigated  with cytochrome P450 3A substrates, inducers and inhibitors, drugs altering  intragastric pH, antiretrovirals, and other often coadministered drugs.  Rilpivirine 25 mg once daily does not have a clinically relevant effect on  exposure of coadministered drugs. Coadministration with cytochrome P450 3A  inhibitors (ketoconazole, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, telaprevir)  results in increased rilpivirine plasma concentrations, but these are not  considered clinically relevant; no dose adjustments are required.  Coadministration of rilpivirine with cytochrome P450 3A inducers (e.g. rifampin,  rifabutin) or compounds increasing gastric pH (e.g. omeprazole, famotidine)  results in decreased rilpivirine plasma concentrations, which may increase the  risk of virologic failure and resistance development. Therefore, strong  cytochrome P450 3A inducers and proton-pump inhibitors are contraindicated.  Histamine-2 receptor antagonists and antacids can be coadministered with  rilpivirine, provided doses are temporally separated.

An in vitro  assessment of 209 frequently prescribed drugs and related xenobiotics was carried  out to examine their potential to inhibit CYP2C8. A validated sensitive,  moderate-throughput high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass  spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) assay was used to detect N-desethylamodiaquine, the  CYP2C8-derived major metabolite of amodiaquine metabolism, using heterologously  expressed recombinant CYP2C8 (rhCYP2C8) and pooled human liver microsomes. The  209 drugs were first tested at 30 muM for their ability to inhibit rhCYP2C8.  Forty-eight compounds exhibited greater than 50% inhibition and were further  evaluated for measurement of IC50. The six most potent inhibitors (IC50 <1  microM) from this set were measured for IC50 in pooled human liver microsomes,  and the most potent inhibitor identified was the leukotriene receptor antagonist,  montelukast (IC50 = 19.6 nM). Inhibitors of CYP2C8 were identified from a wide  variety of therapeutic classes, with no single class predominating. Other potent  inhibitors included candesartan cilexetil (cyclohexylcarbonate ester prodrug of  candesartan), zafirlukast, clotrimazole, felodipine, and mometasone furoate.  Seventeen moderate inhibitors of rhCYP2C8 (1 < IC50 < 10 microM) included  salmeterol, raloxifene, fenofibrate, ritonavir, levothyroxine, tamoxifen,  loratadine, quercetin, oxybutynin, medroxyprogesterone, simvastatin,  ketoconazole, ethinyl estradiol, spironolactone, lovastatin, nifedipine, and  irbesartan. These in vitro data were used along with clinical pharmacokinetic  information in predicting potential drug-drug interactions that could occur by  inhibition of CYP2C8. Although almost all drugs tested are not expected to cause  drug interactions via inhibition of CYP2C8, montelukast was identified as being  of concern as a potential inhibitor of clinical relevance. These findings are  discussed in context to potential drug interactions that could be observed  between these agents and drugs for which CYP2C8 is involved in metabolism and  warrant investigation of the possibility of clinical drug interactions mediated  by inhibition of this enzyme.","2005-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","68-78","","1","45","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15601807","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymology; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology; Xenobiotics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Selective delivery  of chemotherapeutics using LDL as a carrier has therefore been proposed, but the  endogenous nature of LDL hampers its pharmaceutical application. In the current  study, we explored the possibility of synthesizing liposomes that mimic LDL from  commercially available lipids and proteins. Small unilamellar liposomes were  created (28.9 +/- 0.9 nm) and complexed with 5.8 +/- 0.7 molecules of human  recombinant apolipoprotein E (apoE). On intravenous injection into rats, the  liposomes retained their aqueous core, structural integrity, and the majority of  the preassociated apoE. [3H]Cholesteryl oleate-labeled apoE-enriched liposomes  showed a relatively long serum half-life (>5 hr), and a low uptake by cells of  the reticuloendothelial system was observed (<0.8% of the injected dose at 30 min  after injection). Pretreatment of rats with 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol, which  induces the expression of the LDLr on the liver and adrenals, led to a 2.5-fold  accelerated serum clearance (t1/2 = 123 +/- 10 min) and a selectively increased  uptake of liposomes by the liver (2.0-fold) and adrenals (3.8-fold). The liver  association of the liposomes was coupled to the lysosomal uptake route, similarly  as for LDL. In vitro studies using B16 melanoma cells showed that the liposomes  bound exclusively to the LDLr via their apoE moiety (90,000 liposomes/cell), with  a 14-fold higher affinity (Kd = 0.77 +/- 0.09 nM) than LDL itself. Because of  their favorable properties, we anticipate that these apoE-enriched liposomes are  advantageous compared with native LDL in the development of a selective  LDLr-targeted antitumor therapy.","1997-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","445-455","","3","52","","Mol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9281607","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Liver/metabolism; Sensitivity and Specificity; Drug Carriers; Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Receptors, LDL/metabolism; Apolipoproteins E/administration & dosage/*chemical synthesis/*metabolism; Lipoproteins, LDL/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Liposomes/*chemical synthesis/*metabolism; Melanoma, Experimental/metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of  source-separated urine in agriculture removes a human originated estrogen source  from wastewater influents, subsequently enabling nutrient recycling. Estrogenic  activity in urine should be diminished prior to urine usage in agriculture in  order to prevent its migration to soil. A storage period of 6 months is required  for hygienic reasons; therefore, estrogenic activity monitoring is of interest.  The method measured cumulative female hormone-like activity. Calibration curves  were prepared for estrone, 17β-estradiol, 17α- ethinylestradiol and estriol.  Estrogen concentrations of 0.29-29,640 μg L(-1) were detectable while limit of  detection corresponded to 0.28-35 μg L(-1) of estrogens. The yeast sensor  responded well to fresh and stored urine and gave high signals corresponding to  0.38-3,804 μg L(-1) of estrogens in different urine samples.

P.","The role of antiandrogens in hormone replacement therapy.","Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society","","1369-7137","","","The most widely used antiandrogens in clinical practice are cyproterone acetate, a derivative of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and dienogest, a 19-norprogestin. An  established sequential preparation for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) consists  of 11 days of 2 mg estradiol valerate, 10 days of 2 mg estradiol valerate with 1  mg cyproterone acetate, followed by a 7-day drug-free interval (Climen, Schering  AG, Berlin, Germany). Cyproterone acetate is highly progestogenic, has no  androgenic properties, and is antiandrogenic above a certain dose. Cyproterone  acetate does not counteract the estrogenic effects of estradiol valerate in  Climen. This therapy, therefore, has optimal effects on lipid metabolism and  coronary heart disease risk, protects the endometrium and reduces menopausal  symptoms, preserves bone and reduces osteoporotic fracture risk, and has  antiandrogenic effects on the skin and other androgen-sensitive epidermal  structures. Dienogest, on the other hand, will soon be introduced in a continuous  combined HRT. Dienogest has a 17 alpha-cyanomethyl group instead of the 17  alpha-ethinyl group typical of the common 19-nortestosterone derivatives. It is  also referred to as a hybrid progestogen because it has pharmacodynamic  properties (e.g. antiandrogenicity) in common with progesterone derivatives. A  fixed formulation containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2 mg dienogest  (Climodien) for continuous combined HRT has been developed. This formulation had  excellent effects on vasomotor and neurovegetative symptoms. The bleeding pattern  was generally highly satisfactory and similar to that with Kliogest, as were the  results of endometrial biopsies after 12 cycles of treatment. Lipid metabolic  changes may be interpreted as beneficial. Dienogest had no adverse effects on the  vasorelaxant effect of estradiol valerate in postmenopausal women, as shown by  markers of vascular function. Neuropsychological studies utilizing evoked  potentials showed shortening effects on sleep latency and an improvement in  cognitive information processing. Continuous combined HRT with dienogest,  therefore, may come to be regarded as the HRT of choice in postmenopausal  patients with mood defects. In summary, HRT with antiandrogenic progestogens has  its specific indications with respect to preserving metabolic estrogenicity,  specific antiandrogenic effects and specific effects on vigilance and mood  disorders.","2000-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","21-27","","","3 Suppl 2","","Climacteric","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11379383","","","","Humans; Female; Treatment Outcome; Biological Availability; Drug Combinations; Cognition/drug effects; Patient Selection; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Body Weight/drug effects; Coronary Disease/prevention & control; Androgen Antagonists/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Cyproterone Acetate/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Estrogen Replacement Therapy/adverse effects/*methods; Menopause/drug effects; Nandrolone/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/prevention & control; Progesterone Congeners/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was developed 60 years ago, and despite that the composition has  been the same since it was first developed (estrogen and progestogen), over the  years the concentration of ethinyl estradiol has been reduced to improve  tolerability. Nevertheless, progestogens are the basic active agent of hormonal  contraception. The mechanism of progestogens is a multimodal one and basically  three modes of contraceptive action can be distinguished: (a) A strong  antigonadotrophic action leading to the inhibition of ovulation. The necessary  dosage of ovulation inhibition per day is a fixed dosage that is intrinsic to  each progestogen and independent of the dosage of estrogen used or the partial  activities of the progestogen or the mode of application. (b) Thickening of the  cervical mucus to inhibit sperm penetration and (c) desynchronization of the  endometrial changes necessary for implantation. The on the market available  progestogens used for contraception are either used in combined hormonal  contraceptives (in tablets, patches or vaginal rings) or as progestogen only  contraceptives. Progestogen only contraceptives are available as daily oral  preparations, monthly injections, implants (2-3 years) and intrauterine systems  (IUS). Even the long-acting progestogens are highly effective in typical use and  have a very low risk profile. According to their introduction into the market,  progestogens in combined hormonal contraceptives, have been described as 1st,  2nd, 3rd and 4th generation progestogens. The different structures of  progestogens are derivatives from testosterone, progesterone and spironolactone.  These differences in the molecular structure determine pharmacodynamic and  pharmacokinetic differential effects which contribute to the tolerability and  additional beneficial or therapeutic effects whether used in combined oral  contraceptive (COC) or as progestogen only drugs. These differences enhance the  individual options for different patient profiles. The new development of  polymers for vaginal rings allowed on the one hand, the improvement of the  estrogen/progestogen combination in these rings especially regarding the comfort  of use for women (e.g. avoiding the use of cold chains or packages with up to  6-month rings) and on the other hand, the development of progestogen only  formulations.

Batch tests  with estrogen and nitro-estrogen compounds were conducted at nanogram per liter  concentrations with mixed liquor from an AS wastewater treatment facility (WWTF)  operating at a 3 day solids retention time (SRT) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR)  WWTF operating at a 30-40 day SRT. The estrogenic activities of estrone (E1),  17beta-estradiol (E2), and 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were reduced 80-97%  following nitration. First-order biological degradation rate coefficients (kb) of  the nitrated estrogens were 10-50% lower than the parent estrogen compounds. The  kb values for EE2 in MBR and AS mixed liquors were similar, 1.67 and 1.63  L/gVSS-day respectively, indicating that the bacteria responsible for EE2  degradation were present at long and short SRTs. The kb values for E1 and E2 were  2 orders of magnitude greater than for EE2.

Two aspects have been  particularly taken into account: the changes or absence of changes in  plasma/serum concentrations of concomitant drugs and the direct or indirect  evidence of induction, inhibition or lack of effect on the six major human  hepatic CYP isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4), as  well as on other CYP isozymes or enzyme systems. Felbamate clearly affects the  pharmacokinetics of a number of drugs, generally increasing but also decreasing  their concentrations. It induces enzymes such as CYP3A4 and inhibits enzymes such  as CYP2C19 and those of the beta-oxidation pathway. Topiramate is not devoid of  potential interaction properties: it decreases the plasma concentrations of  ethinylestradiol, induces CYP3A4 and inhibits CYP2C19. For oxcarbazepine, no  inhibitory, only inductive effects have been observed thus far. Felbamate.  topiramate and oxcarbazepine may induce the metabolism of steroidal oral  contraceptives. In this respect, tiagabine has been studied at a rather low dose.  Pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction seems to exist between lamotrigine  and carbamazepine. Lamotrigine appears to be a weak inducer of UGTs, whereas  induction of CYP3A4 seems improbable as the compound does not change the  concentrations of oral contraceptives or the urinary excretion of  6beta-hydroxycortisol. Zonisamide has very peculiar pharmacokinetics and an  extensive metabolism. Additional information on its enzyme inducing or inhibiting  properties would be necessary, as data so far collected on its effect on the  pharmacokinetics of other drugs are conflicting. Gabapentin, vigabatrin and in  particular levetiracetam appear to be devoid of significant enzyme inducing or  inhibiting properties.","2000-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","301-319","","4","14","","Fundam Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11030437","","","","Humans; Enzyme Induction; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Interactions; Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Epilepsy/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were no adverse MPT IVR-related  findings of cervicovaginal toxicity or changes in vaginal biopsies or microbiome  community profiles evaluated in sheep. Furthermore, ISL IVR in macaques promoted  sustained release for 28 days with ISL-triphosphate levels above the established  pharmacokinetic benchmark of 50-100 fmol/10(6) PBMCs. The ISL IVR was found to be  safe and well tolerated in the macaques with no observed mucosal cytokine changes  or alterations in peripheral CD4 T-cell populations.

The administration of norethisterone (NET) to long-term castrated  female rats induces the nuclear translocation of pituitary estradiol receptors  and is followed by some estrogenic-like effects at the hypothalamic-pituitary  unit. It is established that an A-ring reduced metabolite of NET, the 3 beta,5  alpha-tetrahydro NET derivative, is responsible for the observed in vivo  estrogenic effects of the parent compound. 3 beta,5 alpha-NET binds to the  estrogen receptor and is efficient in inducing the pituitary estrogen-dependent  progesterone receptor and in increasing the uterine weight in long-term castrated  rats. Furthermore, administration of 3 beta,5 alpha-NET and the 5 alpha-reduced  metabolite of NET (5 alpha-NET) are able to inhibit the release of gonadotropins  in the castrated animal to a greater extent than NET. Moreover, pretreatment with  tamoxifen, an estrogen binding site competitor, results in a significant  diminution of the antigonadotropic potency of 3 beta,5 alpha-NET but not of the 5  alpha-NET, which is only inhibited by the administration of cyproterone acetate.  These findings underline the importance of the metabolic rate of NET for the  expression of its biological effects at the hypothalamic-pituitary unit.","1987","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","657-663","","4-6","27","","J Steroid Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3320552","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Structure-Activity Relationship; Cytosol/metabolism; Cell Nucleus/metabolism; Estrogens/pharmacology; Ovariectomy; Receptors, Steroid/metabolism; Gonadotropins, Pituitary/antagonists & inhibitors; Hypothalamus/drug effects/metabolism; Norethindrone/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Pituitary Gland/drug effects/physiology; Receptors, Estradiol/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to circumvent the potentially confounding influences of maternal  factors, the direct effects of steroidal and nonsteroidal estrogens on cultured  whole embryos were compared at concentrations producing readily measurable  embryotoxicity but low embryolethality (2-20%). Nonsteroidal estrogens included  were diethylstilbestrol (DES), hexestrol (HES), E,E-dienestrol (alpha-DIES), and  tamoxifen (TAM). Steroidal estrogens were estradiol 17 beta (E2), estrone (E1),  and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol 17 beta (EE). For comparative purposes, the effects  of two essentially nonestrogenic phenols, Z,Z-dienestrol (beta-DIES) and phenol,  were also studied. TAM, a weak estrogen which also exhibits antiestrogenic  properties, was studied for possible interactive effects with potent estrogens.  Prosencephalic hypoplasia was the abnormality most consistently observed and was  elicited by each of the chemicals investigated. Embryotoxicity was neither  attenuated by TAM nor related to estrogenic potency or steroidal structure, but  was strongly and unpredictably influenced by biotransformational determinants.  Presence of a cytochrome P450-dependent oxidizing system in the culture medium  resulted in marked increases in embryotoxicity of E1, E2, and phenol, only minor  increases for beta-DIES and alpha-DIES, but in strikingly decreased effects of  EE, TAM, and HES. It produced no statistically significant differences in effects  of DES. The results obtained were compatible with the concept that effects of  these agents on growth and development during the earlier stages of organogenesis  are independent of steroid structure or estrogenic activity but strongly  dependent upon pathways and rates of biotransformation of some (but not all) of  the parent chemicals.","1989-03-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","113-127","","1","98","","Toxicol Appl Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2929019","","","","Male; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Female; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Biotransformation; Structure-Activity Relationship; Pregnancy; Culture Media; Organ Culture Techniques; Estrogens/metabolism/*toxicity; *Abnormalities, Drug-Induced; Diethylstilbestrol/toxicity; Embryo, Mammalian/*drug effects; Estrenes/metabolism/*toxicity; Estrogens, Non-Steroidal/metabolism/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tobacco specific nitrosamine  4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK, nicotine-derived nitrosamine  ketone) is classified as carcinogenic to humans (IARC, Group 1) and considered to  play the most important role in tobacco-related lung carcinogenesis.  Detoxification of NNK through carbonyl reduction is catalyzed by members of the  AKR- and the SDR-superfamilies which include AKR1B10, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C4,  11β-HSD1 and CBR1. Because some reductases are also involved in steroid  metabolism, five different hormones were tested for their inhibitory effect on  NNK carbonyl reduction. Two of those hormones were estrogens (estradiol and  ethinylestradiol), another two hormones belong to the gestagen group  (progesterone and drospirenone) and the last tested hormone was an androgen  (testosterone). Furthermore, one of the estrogens (ethinylestradiol) and one of  the gestagens (drospirenone) are synthetic hormones, used as hormonal  contraceptives. Five of six NNK reducing enzymes (AKR1B10, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C4  and 11β-HSD1) were significantly inhibited by the tested sex hormones. Only NNK  reduction catalyzed by CBR1 was not significantly impaired. In the case of the  other five reductases, gestagens had remarkably stronger inhibitory effects at a  concentration of 25 μM (progesterone: 66-88% inhibition; drospirenone: 26-87%  inhibition) in comparison to estrogens (estradiol: 17-51% inhibition;  ethinylestradiol: 14-79% inhibition) and androgens (14-78% inhibition). Moreover,  in most cases the synthetic hormones showed a greater ability to inhibit NNK  reduction than the physiologic derivatives. These results demonstrate that male  and female sex hormones have different inhibitory potentials, thus indicating  that there is a varying detoxification capacity of NNK in men and women which  could result in a different risk for developing lung cancer.","2017-10-01","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","167-173","","","276","","Chem Biol Interact","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: An integrated population pharmacokinetic (popPK)  analysis of data from over 3400 individuals in ten clinical studies with six  different LNG-releasing contraceptives (four long-acting reversible  contraceptives [LARCs: LNG-IUS 8, 12, and 20, initially releasing LNG 14, 17.5,  and 20 μg/day, a subdermal implant initially releasing LNG 100 μg/day according  to label]; progestin-only pill [POP: LNG 30 μg/day]; and combined oral  contraceptive [COC] pill [LNG 100 μg/day and ethinylestradiol 20 μg/day]), was  conducted to generate a popPK model. LNG release rates, and total and unbound  serum/plasma LNG concentrations with LARCs were estimated over the indicated  period of use; maximum (C(max)) and average (C(av)) serum LNG concentrations were  estimated at steady state for oral contraceptives. Influence of body weight on  LNG PK was also investigated. RESULTS: Serum LNG concentration with LARCs  increased with increasing daily LNG release rate, being lowest with LNG-IUS 8,  higher with LNG-IUS 12 and LNG-IUS 20, and highest with the subdermal implant  (1.7-2.1-times that with LNG-IUS 20). Compared with early serum LNG  concentrations with LNG-IUS 20, C(av) and C(max) were 1.7- and 4.5-fold higher  with POP, and 8.6- and 18-fold higher with COC. Total LNG bioavailability was  >97% for the LNG-IUSs and 66-80% with other contraceptives. Serum/plasma LNG  concentrations decreased with increasing body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Among the  contraceptives examined, COC had the highest and LNG-IUSs the lowest systemic  exposure to LNG. Systemic LNG concentration was inversely correlated to body  weight.","2020-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:30:58","","417-426","","6","25","","Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33006493","","","","Humans; Female; Body Weight; pharmacokinetics; Contraception; levonorgestrel; Intrauterine Devices, Medicated; Levonorgestrel/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Contraceptive Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; levonorgestrel-releasing contraceptive system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prediction of in vivo hepatic drug glucuronidation from liver  microsomal data yielded a consistent 10-fold under-prediction. Consideration of  protein binding was observed to be pivotal when predicting in vivo  glucuronidation for acid substrates. Studies using human intestinal microsomes  demonstrated the majority of drugs to be extensively glucuronidated such that the  intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) of ethinylestradiol (CL(int) = 1.3 microl/min/mg)  was twice that obtained using human liver microsomes (CL(int) = 0.7  microl/min/mg). The potential extrahepatic in vivo glucuronidation was calculated  for a range of drug substrates from human microsomal data. These results indicate  the contribution of intestinal drug glucuronidation to systemic drug clearance to  be much less than either hepatic or renal glucuronidation. Therefore, data  obtained with intestinal microsomes may be misleading in the assessment of the  contribution of this organ to systemic glucuronidation. The use of hepatocytes to  assess metabolic stability for drugs predominantly metabolized by glucuronidation  was also investigated. Metabolic clearances for a range of drugs obtained using  fresh preparations of human hepatocytes predicted accurately hepatic clearance  reported in vivo. The use of cryopreserved hepatocytes as an in vitro tool to  predict in vivo metabolism was also assessed with an excellent correlation  obtained for a number of extensively glucuronidated drugs (R(2) = 0.80, p <  0.001).","2002-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","382-390","","1","301","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11907196","","","","Humans; Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; In Vitro Techniques; Predictive Value of Tests; Protein Binding; Algorithms; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism; Hepatocytes/drug effects/metabolism; Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Body Weight/physiology; Intestines/drug effects; Glucuronides/*metabolism; Kidney/drug effects/metabolism; Organ Size/physiology; *Metabolic Clearance Rate; Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism; Dialysis; Albumins/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bisphenol A (BPA) was chosen as a model substance to investigate the  influence of sludge conditioning on the end-concentration of EDCs in sludge.  Adsorption studies with radioactive-labelled BPA showed that more than 75% BPA in  anaerobically digested sludge is bound to solids (log Kd = 2.09-2.30; log Koc =  2.72-3.11). Sludge conditioning with polymer or iron (III) chloride alone had no  influence on the adsorption of BPA. After conditioning with iron (III) chloride  and calcium hydroxide desorption of BPA took place. Apparently, it occurred due  to the deprotonation of BPA (pKa= 10.3) as the pH-value reached 12.4 during the  process. The same behaviour is expected for other phenolic EDCs with similar pKa  (nonylphenol, 17beta-estradiol, estron, estriol, 17alpha-ethinylestradiol). This  study shows high affinity of BPA to the anaerobically digested sludge and  importance of conditioning in the elimination of EDCs during the sludge  treatment. Addition of polymer is favourable in the case of sludge incineration.  Conditioning with iron (III) chloride and calcium hydroxide shows advantages for  the use of sludge as fertiliser.","2004","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","133-140","","5","50","","Water Sci Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15497840","","","","Time Factors; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Carbon Isotopes; Absorption; Benzhydryl Compounds; Sewage/*chemistry; Bacteria, Anaerobic/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/metabolism; Endocrine System/*drug effects; Cities; Calcium Hydroxide/pharmacology; Chlorides; Estradiol/analysis/metabolism; Estrogens/analysis/metabolism; Ferric Compounds/pharmacology; Norethynodrel/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism; Phenols/metabolism/*toxicity; Soil Pollutants/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Main  results for the whole study population were (median; interquartile range in  parentheses): dose, 200 (100-300) mg; serum concentration, 2.97 (1.82-4.74)  microg/mL; Lamotrigine serum concentration-to-dose ratio (LTG-CDR), 14.8  (9.9-24.6) (ng/mL)/(mg/d). A linear mixed model, allowing multiple observations  from the same patient, was used to identify and quantitate the effect of factors  influencing the LTG-CDR. In addition to age and gender, a total of 35 different  comedications (25 drugs used in psychiatry as well as 10 other drugs) were  evaluated. With women younger than 70 years as the reference group, factors found  to lower the LTG-CDR significantly were: male gender and comedication with  carbamazepine, ethinylestradiol, fluoxetine, lithium, phenytoin, phenobarbital,  or topiramate. Factors associated with a significantly higher LTG-CDR were: age >  or =70 years, and cotreatment with valproate. No antidepressants other than  fluoxetine and none of the antipsychotic drugs included were associated with an  altered LTG-CDR. Concerning pharmacokinetic drug interactions, we conclude that  lamotrigine can be safely combined with most psychotropic drugs.","2005-08","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","342-348","","4","25","","J Clin Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16012277","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Drug Interactions; Age Factors; Sex Factors; Drug Monitoring; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; Lamotrigine; Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Polypharmacy; Mental Disorders/blood/drug therapy; Nervous System Diseases/blood/drug therapy; Psychotropic Drugs/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Triazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been hypothesized that generation of reactive  estrogen-quinones and oxidative stress, both of which result from metabolic  activation of estrogens, play an essential role in estrogen-induced  carcinogenesis. This hypothesis was tested using the estrogen-receptor  (ER)-alpha-positive hamster kidney tumor (H301) and the human breast cancer  (MCF-7) cell lines. Estrogens with differing carcinogenic potentials were  compared in terms of their capacities to induce 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-  iso-PGF(2alpha)), a marker of oxidative stress. Tumor cells were treated with  either 17beta-estradiol (E2), a carcinogenic estrogen or  17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE), a weakly-carcinogenic estrogen. Tumor cells were  also treated with alpha-naphthoflavone, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, or a  combination of alpha-naphthoflavone and E2 to study the effect of metabolic  activation of E2 on E2-induced oxidative stress. H301 cells treated with E2  displayed time- and dose-dependent increases in 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), compared to  controls; treatment with 10 nM E2 resulted in a maximal 4-fold induction  following 48 h of treatment. In contrast, H301 cells treated with EE did not  display an increase in 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) compared with controls. In H301 cells  cotreated with alpha-naphthoflavone and E2, alpha-naphthoflavone inhibited the  E2-induced increase in 8-iso-PGF(2alpha). These data indicate that a carcinogenic  estrogen shows strong oxidant potential, whereas a weakly-carcinogenic estrogen  shows poor oxidant potential. Furthermore, inhibiting metabolic activation of a  carcinogenic estrogen blocks its oxidant potential. Our data support the  hypothesis that metabolic activation and subsequent generation of oxidative  stress may play critical roles in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis.","2004","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","37-42","","1","18","","J Biochem Mol Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14994278","","","","Humans; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism; Biotransformation/*drug effects; Cricetinae; Oxidative Stress/drug effects; Benzoflavones/pharmacology; Estrogens/*toxicity; Carcinogens/*toxicity; Dinoprost/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism; Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/toxicity; Oxidants/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The accumulation factor normalised to worm lipid content and sediment  TOC (AFlipid/OC) was 75 at the end of the uptake period, but a steady state was  not reached.

After 10 days of elimination in contaminant-free  sediment 50% of the accumulated total radioactivity was excreted by the worms.  Extracts from L. variegatus sampled at the end of the uptake phase were analysed  by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The results showed that 6% of the total  radioactivity incorporated by the worms was 14C-EE2. After treatment of extracts  with beta-glucuronidase the amount of 14C-EE2 increased to 84%.

These compounds  have higher systemic, but reduced hepatic, oestrogenic activity than their parent  steroids. The release of the parent oestrogen results from the passage of the  sulfamates in the erythrocyte compartment through the liver and the systemic  hydrolysis of the sulfamate ester. Sulfamates may be used to generate natural  oestrogens, oestradiol and other oestrogens for different types of oral oestrogen  therapy, e.g., as oestriol for hindered oestrogen or as 17-alpha oestradiol for  'non-feminising' oestrogen. Oestradiol sulfamate J995 is currently in the initial  stages of clinical testing. It has per se no oestrogen receptor affinity or  oestrogenic activity in vitro, i.e., is inactive without hydrolysis. Its oral  uterotropic activity in rats is approximately 100-times higher than that of  oestradiol, its hepatotropic activity, however, is only 2- to 3-fold higher than  oestradiol. Oral oestradiol sulfamate treatment should, therefore, reduce the  hepatic side-effects seen with conventional oral hormone therapy, while at the  same time lead to full stimulation of the uterus and the vagina, and suppression  of gonadotropin. In the rat, orally administered oestradiol is effectively  extracted from the portal vein and excreted via the bile. In contrast, oestradiol  sulfamate is present in the circulation at high concentrations, up to 30% of the  dose. Initially, 98% of this is found in the erythrocyte compartment and only 2%  in the plasma. Significant oestradiol levels in the blood are recorded during the  depletion of this pool. Pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies reveal complete  excretion of the compound and its metabolites. No toxic effects have been seen in  rats and cynomolgus monkeys at any dose, in spite of the compound's distinct  oestrogenicity. The evaluation of genotoxicity also yielded negative results.","1998-04","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 10:28:19","","575-589","","4","7","","Expert Opin Investig Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15991994","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

T.","Are all estrogens the same?","Maturitas","","0378-5122","10.1016/j.maturitas.2003.11.009","","This paper focuses on the question whether different estrogens (E) have different qualitative pharmacodynamic effects when used by women for contraception, Hormone  Replacement Therapy (HRT) or prevention of osteoporosis. In this context  estrogens have been defined as the estrogen agonists estradiol (E2), estrone  (E1), estriol (E3), conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), diethylstilbestrol (DES)  and ethinylestradiol (EE). Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator's (SERM's) have  been excluded from this analysis primarily because of lack of comparative  (clinical) data with estrogen agonists. A major problem when addressing the issue  of comparability of estrogen agonists is the lack of data from head-to-head  estrogen-only comparative studies. Comparative studies have been performed almost  exclusively with estrogen agonists combined with a series of different  progestogens (P), that have been added to protect the uterus from endometrial  hyperplasia. Since progestogens are known to exhibit different intrinsic  pharmacodynamic properties and interactions with estrogens, it is impossible to  judge which role the estrogen plays when qualitative differences between  different combined E/P preparations are observed. In summary, no convincing  evidence has been found that the estrogens mentioned differ qualitatively.  Obviously quantitative differences are present due to differences in e.g.  receptor affinity, metabolism (half life) and route of administration  (transdermal/vaginal). Since DES has been discarded for human use due to  teratogenicity, EE used in all combined E/P oral contraceptives is the most  potent estrogen agonist available at present. In HRT, E2 and CEE are equally  effective for the treatment of hot flushes and urogenital atrophy and superior to  any other treatment option. For long term treatment to prevent osteoporosis and  even for short term HRT, estrogen agonists are heavily debated recently because  of a small increased risk of breast cancer, that has been known for a long time  already. Well informed and individualised choice of treatment seems the  appropriate solution.","2004-04-15","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","269-275","","4","47","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 15063479","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; *Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Administration, Cutaneous; Estrogens/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Upon application of  this method to patients receiving different kinds of drug therapy, Herbert Remmer  was the first to describe that total human hepatic cytochrome P450 was markedly  elevated by the new anti-tuberculosis drug rifampicin. Similar observations were  made for the antimycotic clotrimazol. In 1975, Herbert Remmer's group described  the unique species difference that induction of cytochrome P450 by rifampicin did  not occur in the rat. After the first clinical reports of impaired effectiveness  of oral contraception in persons treated with rifampicin, studies at Herbert  Remmer's Institute showed a 4-fold increase, after repetitive rifampicin  administration to humans, in the ability of hepatic microsomes to  ortho-hydroxylate the contraceptive estrogen ethinylestradiol, compared to  microsomes from untreated normal subjects. Subsequent pharmacokinetic  investigations were compatible with this induction of the estrogen-2-hydroxylase  by rifampicin and provided a rational explanation for the classical drug  interaction between rifampicin and oral contraceptives. These early studies, in  the 1970s in Tübingen, were followed by further developments. It was realized  that the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major CYP isozyme in the  human liver metabolizing a variety of xenobiotics and endobiotics, being also  responsible for the 2-hydroxylation of ethinylestradiol. The inducibility of  CYP3A4 by barbiturates and rifampicin explains the effects of inducers to enhance  the clearance of ethynylestradiol and thereby to reduce the effectiveness of oral  contraceptives, rifampicin being one of the most potent inducers of human CYP3A4  gene expression. Since 1998, novel ""orphan"" members of the nuclear hormone  receptor superfamily were cloned from mouse, rat, rabbit, and human origin. These  so-called pregnane X receptors (PXR), across species, are activated by inducers  of CYP3A4 expression. It now appears that PXR is a key mediator of complex  induction processes of xenobiotic processing enzymes, which are triggered by  rifampicin and other inducers. Studies of the structure and substrate affinities  of PXR have provided the rational explanation of the unique species difference of  rifampicin induction between humans and rats that was first described by Herbert  Remmer.","2004-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","497-509","","3-4","36","","Drug Metab Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15554232","","","","Humans; Animals; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Enzyme Induction/drug effects/physiology; Germany; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*biosynthesis; History, 20th Century; Rifampin/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of age and obesity on the pharmacokinetics (PK), hepatic blood flow (HBF) and liver metabolism of 10 compounds was determined in rats. The animals  fed a high-fat diet were defined as the diet-induced obese (DIO) group, while the  animals that were aged similar to the DIO rats but not fed with high-fat diet  were called the age-matched (AM) group. 2. The clearance (CL) values of high CL  compounds (CL > 50 mL/min/kg, namely propranolol, diazepam, phenytoin,  ethinylestradiol, lorcaserin and fenfluramine) decreased significantly (1.5- to  6-fold) in DIO and AM rats as compared to lean rats, while there was no clear  trend for change in CL for the low-to-moderate CL compounds (CL < 50 mL/min/kg,  namely atenolol, chlorzoxazone, vancomycin and sibutramine). Hepatocytes  incubations revealed a change in half life (t1/2) only for phenytoin. The body  weight normalized liver weights and HBF of AM and DIO rats were found to be 2- to  3-fold lower than in lean rats. 3.

The transdermal method is  user-friendly and is abided by a high degree of acceptability, and a low level of  skin irritability. Its contraceptive effectiveness is similar to that conferred  by oral contraceptives except if the treated woman is over 90 kg, in which case  Evra should not be prescribed. Cycle control is excellent and similar to that of  triphasic pills. Adverse effects and tolerance are comparable to those described  with low-dose oral contraceptives with a slight estrogen dominance. Lipid and  glucose metabolism as well as coagulation are influenced in the same way.  Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting) do not prevent the efficacy of  the transdermal patch. Compliance with Evra is significantly higher than with  oral combined contraceptives--a major point for an effective contraception.  Accordingly, Evra constitutes an useful addition to the current array of  contraceptive methods.","2003-11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","709-712","","11","58","","Rev Med Liege","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: Belgium PMID: 14748201","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Lipid Metabolism; Drug Combinations; Nausea/chemically induced; Glucose/metabolism; Administration, Cutaneous; Contraceptives, Oral; Vomiting/chemically induced; Oximes; Ethisterone/analogs & derivatives; Norgestrel/analogs & derivatives; Menstrual Cycle/*drug effects; Contraception/*methods; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we determined the ability of the dietary  flavonoid chrysin to induce UGT activity, protein and mRNA. When pretreating  human hepatoma Hep G2 cells with 25 microM chrysin, the glucuronidation of  chrysin itself increased 4.2-fold when measured in the intact cell and 14-fold in  the cell homogenate, i.e., autoinduction. Microsomes from chrysin-treated cells  probed with specific antibodies in Western analyses showed marked induction of  the UGT1A family of proteins. Isoform-specific induction of the important hepatic  UGT1A1 protein was observed but not of UGT1A6 or UGT2B7. The strong induction of  UGT1A1 was confirmed by Northern analyses of total RNA as well as mRNA, using a  specific probe. UGT1A1 message as well as protein was detectable also in  untreated Hep G2 cells. In catalytic activity assays with recombinant UGT1A1,  1A4, 1A6 and 1A9, chrysin was found to be a high affinity substrate for UGT1A1  (K(m) 0.35 microM). Catalytic activity was also found for UGT1A9 and 1A6 but not  for 1A4. Further studies demonstrated a 20-fold induction of the glucuronidation  of bilirubin by the chrysin-treated cells and a 7. 9-fold induction of the  glucuronidation of the oral contraceptive drug ethinylestradiol, two of the best  known and specific UGT1A1 substrates, demonstrating the potential importance of  this induction. In view of these findings, it will be important to extend these  studies to other dietary flavonoids.","2000-09","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1077-1082","","9","28","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10950852","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Blotting, Western; Microsomes, Liver/metabolism; Blotting, Northern; Bilirubin/metabolism; Glucuronides/metabolism; Flavonoids/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Glucuronosyltransferase/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism; Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The following specific assays were investigated: testosterone  6beta-hydroxylation [cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4)], coumarin hydroxylation  (CYP2A6), (R)-warfarin hydroxylation (CYP1A2), (S)-mephenytoin hydroxylation  (CYP2C19), p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (CYP2E1) tolbutamide hydroxylation  (CYP2C9), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), epoxide hydrolase and  UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) toward paracetamol (UGT1*6), ethinyloestradiol  (UGT1*1), p-nitrophenol (UGT(pl 6.2)), and valproic acid. None of these  activities were affected by levetiracetam or AcL added at concentrations up to 1  mM. Additionally, primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were used to assess a  potential inducing effect of levetiracetam on CYPs. Phenobarbital (2 mM),  beta-naphtoflavone (40 microM), dexamethasone (1 microM), and phenytoin (up to  300 microM) were tested as positive controls. When added to cells for 48 h, all  the positive controls increased 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity  demonstrating the inducibility of CYPs in the present culture conditions. By  contrast, levetiracetam did not affect the activity up to 1 mM. The highest  levetiracetam concentrations examined in the above in vitro studies are well in  excess of those measured in the plasma of patients receiving therapeutic doses.  It is thus concluded that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce pharmacokinetic  interactions through inhibition of CYPs, UGTs, and epoxide hydrolase.  Furthermore, based on the in vitro assays with rat hepatocytes, it could be  speculated that levetiracetam does not act as a CYP inducer.","1999-02","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","250-254","","2","27","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9929511","","","","Humans; Male; Biomarkers; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; In Vitro Techniques; Drug Interactions; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Anticonvulsants/metabolism/*pharmacology; Butyrates/pharmacology; Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors; Glucuronosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors; Levetiracetam; Liver/cytology/drug effects/metabolism; Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Piracetam/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology; Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vivo, norgestimate undergoes extensive and rapid deacetylation to produce  17-deacetylnorgestimate (NGMN), an active circulating metabolite that likely  contributes significantly to norgestimate efficacy. Despite being of primary  significance, the metabolism and reaction phenotyping of NGMN have not been  previously reported. Hence, detailed biotransformation and reaction phenotyping  studies of NGMN with recombinant cytochrome P450 (P450), recombinant uridine  5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, and human liver microsomes in the presence  and absence of selective P450 inhibitors were conducted. It was found that CYP3A4  plays a key role in NGMN metabolism with a fraction metabolized (f(m)) of 0.57.  CYP2B6 and to an even lesser extent CYP2C9 were also observed to catalyze NGMN  metabolism. Using this CYP3A4 f(m) value, the predicted plasma concentration  versus time area under the curve (AUC) change in NGMN using a basic/mechanistic  static model was found to be within 1.3-fold of the reported NGMN AUC changes for  four modulators of CYP3A4. In addition to NGMN, we have also elucidated the  biotransformation of norgestrel (NG), a downstream norgestimate and NGMN  metabolite, and found that CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 have a major contribution to the  elimination of NG with a combined f(m) value of 1.

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) caused by induction of CYP3A4 can result in  decreased exposure to coadministered drugs, with potential loss of efficacy.  Immortalized hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells) have been proposed as a tool to identify  CYP3A4 inducers. The purpose of the current studies was to characterize the  effect of known inducers on CYP3A4 in Fa2N-4 cells, and to determine whether  these in vitro data could reliably project the magnitude of DDIs caused by  induction. Twenty-four compounds were chosen for these studies, based on  previously published data using primary human hepatocytes. Eighteen compounds had  been shown to be positive for induction, and six compounds had been shown to be  negative for induction. In Fa2N-4 cells, all 18 positive controls produced  greater than 2-fold maximal CYP3A4 induction, and all 6 negative controls  produced less than 1.5-fold maximal CYP3A4 induction. Subsequent studies were  conducted to determine the relationship between in vitro induction data and in  vivo induction response. The approach was to relate in vitro induction data  (E(max) and EC(50) values) with efficacious free plasma concentrations to  calculate a relative induction score. This score was then correlated with  decreases in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve values for  coadministered CYP3A4 object drugs (midazolam or ethinylestradiol) from  previously published clinical DDI studies. Excellent correlations (r(2) values  >0.92) were obtained, suggesting that Fa2N-4 cells can be used for identification  of inducers as well as prediction of the magnitude of clinical DDIs.","2006-10","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","1742-1748","","10","34","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16837568","","","","Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Cell Line; Algorithms; Rifampin/pharmacology; *Drug Interactions; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; Dexamethasone/pharmacology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*biosynthesis; Pioglitazone; Rosiglitazone; Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology; Phenobarbital/pharmacology; Cell Survival/drug effects; Cell Proliferation/drug effects; Carbamazepine/pharmacology; Nifedipine/pharmacology; Sulfinpyrazone/pharmacology; Hepatocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism; Phenytoin/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are frequently  reported with some drugs, such as antiepileptics, and with some contraceptive  methods, such as the implant, not always understood by patients as hormonal  contraception. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to review all drugs and foods  at risk of interaction with contraceptives. METHODS: The official recommendations  established by the French Agency for the safety of medicinal products have been  taken into account, supported by a review of the literature. RESULTS: There is a  risk of drug-drug interaction with all hormonal contraceptives regardless of  their route of administration. Most interactions lead to a decrease in the  effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. If an enzyme inducer drug is started in  a woman with an hormonal contraception, it is recommended, if the treatment is  short, to use an additional mechanical contraception (barrier method) for the  duration of the treatment and the cycle following its arrest and if the treatment  is long, it is recommended to choose a non-hormonal contraceptive method. On the  contrary, some drugs may increase ethinylestradiol levels and potentially the  risk of complications. Exceptionally, it is the hormonal contraceptive that will  alter the pharmacokinetics of another drug, for example, lamotrigine.  CONCLUSIONS: The risk of drug interaction leading to a decrease in the  contraceptive effectiveness needs to be known to prescribers in order to be taken  into account when prescribing any new drug in a woman with hormonal contraception  (and whatever its route of administration).","2018-12","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","786-791","","12","46","","Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol","","","","","","","","fre","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS: Papers were  identified by electronic searches in Chinese and international databases and  manual searches of Chinese journals and index of family planning literature. Data  on pharmacokinetics, clinical performance and laboratory examinations were  extracted from 17 papers of mixed quality on pills containing quinestrol 3 mg and  norgestrel 12 mg (Quin-Ng) or levonorgestrel 6 mg (Quin-Lng) used by women in  China. RESULTS: Quin-Lng pills gave steady-state serum levels of ethinylestradiol  between 0.20-0.25 and 0.15 ng/mL. The 1-year perfect use pregnancy rate was 1.1  per 100 women-years. Nausea and increased leukorrhea were common; bleeding  control was good. Hypertension developed in 5.8% of Quin-Ng pill users during the  first year of use. For Quin-Ng and Quin-Lng once-a-month pills, 1 year  continuation rates were 73.6 and 82.1 per 100, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of  good quality data prevents confident assessment of the safety and efficacy of  once-a-month pills. Short-term safety information indicates a high incidence of  bothersome side effects and hypertension. The high monthly estrogen and  progestogen doses raise questions about the safety of the once-a-month pills.","2007-05","2023-09-01 09:20:11","2023-09-01 09:20:11","","337-343","","5","75","","Contraception","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17434014","","","","Humans; Female; Liver Function Tests; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Pregnancy; Lipids/blood; Menstruation/drug effects; Pregnancy Rate; Contraceptives, Oral, Combined/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
