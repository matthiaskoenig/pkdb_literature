"ZQN7ZVZQ","journalArticle","2022","Ernst, Michael E.; Fravel, Michelle A.","Thiazide and the Thiazide-Like Diuretics: Review of Hydrochlorothiazide, Chlorthalidone, and Indapamide","American Journal of Hypertension","","1941-7225","10.1093/ajh/hpac048","","The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogenous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure-the thiazide-type (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)-and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring-the thiazide-like (e.g., chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients, and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent blood pressure reduction occurs. Thiazides remain underutilized, with only about one-third of hypertensive patients receiving them. For many patients, however, a thiazide is an indispensable component of their regimen to achieve adequate blood pressure control.","2022-07-01","2023-08-25 22:08:43","2023-08-25 22:08:43","","573-586","","7","35","","Am J Hypertens","Thiazide and the Thiazide-Like Diuretics","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35404993","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35404993","","Humans; Antihypertensive Agents; Hypertension; blood pressure; hypertension; Diuretics; Hydrochlorothiazide; chlorthalidone; Chlorthalidone; hydrochlorothiazide; indapamide; Indapamide; thiazide diuretic; Thiazides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 male  healthy volunteers participated in the open-label, single-dose,  randomized-sequence, 2-way crossover study. Eligible subjects were randomly  assigned (1:1) to receive a single 300/12.5-mg dose of either the test or  reference formulation followed by a 1-week washout. Blood samples were obtained  before (0 hours) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72  hours after dosing. Plasma concentrations of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide  were analyzed by two separate validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass  spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) methods. RESULTS: For irbesartan, the 90% confidence  intervals (CIs) of AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were 103.27-116.71%, 105.01-121.47%,  and 84.15-96.88%, respectively. For hydrochlorothiazide, the 90% CIs of AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞, and Cmax were 96.11-109.02%, 95.15-107.35%, and 91.66-101.40%,  respectively. A total of 3 mild AEs were reported in 3 subjects (12.5%).  CONCLUSION: In this study, a single dose (300/12.5-mg) of the test formulation of  irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide FDC tablet in fasting healthy Chinese male  volunteers met WHO's and China's FDA regulatory criteria for assumption of  bioequivalence to the reference formulation based on AUC and Cmax.

The substance thus  administered was readily absorbed from the gut, with peak plasma levels being  detected on average at 3 h after dosing; after that, plasma concentrations of  fenquizone decreased biexponentially in a pattern fitting an open two-compartment  model. Plasma half-life values were 1 h for phase alpha and 17 h for phase beta.  The half-life calculated from urinary concentrations was 18 h. The apparent  distribution volume for phase beta was 686 l; renal clearance was 220 ml/min, and  the absorption constant (Ka) was 1055 h-1. Cumulative urinary excretion accounted  for 53.1% of the administered dose in 72 h. Thus the pharmacokinetic profile of  fenquizone was that of an ""intermediate-acting"" diuretic about half-way between  the short-acting hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide and furosemide and the  long-acting chlorthalidone. In summation, fenquizone is described as a low-dosage  diuretic apparently not conducive to accumulation; its pharmacokinetic profile  qualifies the product particularly well for maintenance therapy, such as is  needed for the management of essential hypertension, both as sole medication and  in fixed-ratio combination with beta-blockers, and at any rate with once-a-day  administration.","1985","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:29:53","","994-998","","6","35","","Arzneimittelforschung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 4026929","","","","*Sulfonamides; Adult; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Diuretics/*blood/pharmacology/urine; Female; Half-Life; Heart Rate/drug effects; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Kinetics; Male; Quinazolines/*blood/pharmacology/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this investigation was to determine  whether a drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction exists between diltiazem and  hydrochlorothiazide. In a randomized, crossover, open study, multiple doses of  diltiazem (60 mg four times daily for 21 doses) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg  twice daily for 11 doses) were administered alone and in combination on three  separate occasions to 20 healthy male volunteers. Trough and serial blood samples  were collected and plasma was assayed for diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, and  diltiazem metabolites (desacetyldiltiazem and N-desmethyldiltiazem) using HPLC.  Total urine was also collected and quantified for hydrochlorothiazide.  Coadministered hydrochlorothiazide did not significantly (p > 0.05) alter  diltiazem (alone versus combination) steady-state maximum plasma concentration  (Css(max); 145 versus 158 ng mL(-1), respectively), time to maximum plasma  concentration (t(max); 3.0 versus 2.8 h, respectively); area under the plasma  concentration-time curve (AUCss; 688 versus 771 ng x h mL(-1)), oral clearance  (Cl(oral); 96.2 versus 88.0 L h(-1)), or elimination half-life (t(1/2); 5.2  versus 5.2 h).

Thiazide or  loop diuretics are commonly prescribed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  This study investigated potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between  empagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or torasemide (TOR). METHODS: This  was an open-label, crossover study. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were  randomized to receive empagliflozin 25 mg once daily for 5 days and either HCTZ  25 mg once daily for 4 days followed by HCTZ 25 mg once daily plus empagliflozin  25 mg once daily for 5 days or TOR 5 mg once daily for 4 days followed by TOR 5  mg once daily plus empagliflozin once daily for 5 days in 1 of 4 sequences, with  at least a 7-day washout period between treatments. Pharmacokinetic parameters of  empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were assessed and standard bioequivalence criteria  (80%-125%) were applied. Tolerability assessments included the frequency of  adverse events and an investigator assessment of global tolerability. FINDINGS:  Mean (SD) age of the 22 patients treated was 54.0 (8.1) years and body mass index  was 27.1 (3.7) kg/m(2). Coadministration of empagliflozin with HCTZ or TOR had no  effect on exposure to empagliflozin, HCTZ, or TOR. Geometric mean ratios (90%  CIs) for empagliflozin AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady  state were 107.1% (90% CI, 97.1-118.1) and 102.8% (90% CI, 88.6-119.3),  respectively, when coadministered with HCTZ versus administration alone, and  107.8% (90% CI, 100.1-116.1) and 107.5% (90% CI, 97.9-118.0), respectively, when  coadministered with TOR versus administration alone. For HCTZ, the geometric mean  ratios for AUC over a uniform dosing interval and Cmax at steady state were 96.3%  (90% CI, 89.1-104.0) and 101.8% (90% CI, 88.6-116.9), respectively, and for TOR  were 101.4% (90% CI, 99.1-103.9) and 104.4% (90% CI, 93.8-116.3), respectively,  for combined treatment versus administration alone. The pharmacokinetic profiles  of empagliflozin, HCTZ, and TOR were similar after administration alone and in  combination. Global tolerability was good for all patients after each treatment,  and no severe or serious adverse events were reported.

The cumulative urinary excretion of  hydrochlorothiazide correlated poorly (r = 0.27) with areas under plasma drug  level curves, although the correlation between the means of these values for each  of the three treatments was high (r = 0.996).. Close similarity was observed  between urinary excretion rates of hydrochlorothiazide and the time course of  drug concentrations in plasma.","1982-02","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 13:28:27","","245-248","","2","71","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7062255","","","","*Fasting; Adult; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/blood/*metabolism/urine; Kinetics; Male","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective clinical and pharmacokinetic study. SETTING:  Intensive care unit of a Cancer Research Institute. PATIENTS: Nine patients (age  range 31 to 57 yrs) with progressive cancer disease and without cardiovascular,  renal, or hepatic dysfunctions. INTERVENTIONS: After a loading dose (0.15 mg/kg  followed by 12 hrs of continuous intravenous infusion at 0.20 mg/kg/hr), the  infusion rate of verapamil was increased every 24 hrs (0.25, 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40  mg/kg/hr). The highest rate was maintained for 48 hrs. Doxorubicin was given from  the 60 th to the 108 th hr. Hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) and potassium (36  mmol/day) were given orally. Altogether, 17 courses were completed. MEASUREMENTS  AND MAIN RESULTS: Steady state concentration (C(SS) and systemic clearance of  verapamil and nor-verapamil (active metabolite) for each infusion rate were  calculated. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), heart  rate (HR), PR, QT and QTc intervals, and left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF) were measured, as well as daily body weight, blood glucose and potassium.  C(SS) of verapamil and nor-verapamil increased more than proportionally to the  infusion rate (p<.001). Systemic clearance of verapamil decreased over the range  of the infusion rate (p<.005). MAP and HR decreased at the 12th hr (p<.001) and  then plateaued. CVP increased (p<.01). The relationship between MAP, HR, CVP, and  verapamil plasma concentrations was significant (r2 = .25, .14, and .35,  respectively; p<.0001). LVEF did not change. Six patients (11 courses) developed  junctional rhythm. Three patients (six courses) showed a PR interval increase  (p<.05). Patients with junctional rhythm had higher Css of verapamil (p<.009).  Overall, QT and QTc intervals increased (p<.01). A linear relationship was  observed between verapamil plasma concentrations and QT intervals (r2 = .09,  p<.01). Cardiovascular side effects did not determine treatment withdrawal in any  patient. Body weight, blood glucose, and potassium did not show significant  changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a capacity-limited clearance of high-dose  verapamil. In the absence of heart disease, following a step by step increase of  the dosage, the high plasma verapamil concentrations (617 to 2970 ng/mL) produce  frequent but well tolerated hemodynamic and electrocardiogram changes.","1999-02","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 13:33:58","","332-339","","2","27","","Crit Care Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10075058","","","","*Critical Care; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Calcium Channel Blockers/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Electrocardiography/drug effects; Female; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/physiopathology; Prospective Studies; Time Factors; Verapamil/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compliance with a multiple medication  regimen can be difficult for some patients; therefore, a combination of VAL + HCT  tablets may be a suitable alternative. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to  compare the rate and extent of absorption of VAL and HCT after oral  administration as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet and concomitant  administration of the individual drugs under fasting conditions in healthy  Egyptian subjects. The study was extended to investigate any potential  interaction between VAL and HCT. METHODS: This study was conducted as an  open-label, randomized study with 2 parts (parts I and II), with each part  consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods with a crossover design and 2-week  washout periods. Blood samples were collected up to 48 hours postdose, and plasma  was analyzed for VAL and HCT concentrations by using HPLC. The pharmacokinetic  properties of each drug after co-administration of VAL and HCT were compared with  those of each drug administered alone. Tolerability was assessed by physical  examination and verbally questioning subjects regarding their well-being and any  feelings of discomfort. All events reported by the subjects were recorded in  adverse-event forms. RESULTS: Forty-eight healthy subjects were enrolled (24 in  each part), and all subjects completed the study. None of the participants showed  any sign of adverse drug reactions during or after the completion of the study.  Statistical analysis confirmed that the 90% CIs for AUC and Cmax of VAL/HCT FDC  and VAL + HCT were within the commonly accepted bioequivalence range of 0.8 to  1.25. As a result, from an in vivo pharmacokinetic perspective, 1 FDC tablet  could be considered interchangeable in medical practice with the 2 individual  reference tablets. However, the 90% CIs between VAL alone and when administered  with HCT, either as FDC or concomitantly, indicated the presence of an  interaction between VAL and HCT, which would significantly decrease the systemic  exposure and intensity of VAL absorption. The co-administration of HCT with VAL  decreased the AUC and Cmax of HCT nonsignificantly compared with administration  of HCT alone. CONCLUSIONS: Both VAL/HCT FDC and VAL + HCT were well tolerated.  The safety/efficacy profile of VAL + HCT co-administration therapy could be  extended to the VAL/HCT FDC tablet. The interaction of HCT with other  angiotensin-receptor blockers should be investigated to determine whether this  interaction is limited to VAL or if other angiotensin-receptor blockers have the  same pharmacokinetic interactions. Further studies are necessary to determine the  role of efflux and influx transporters on VAL and HCT disposition and  pharmacokinetics.","2013-06","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:23:07","","846-861","","6","35","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

METHODS: The systolic blood pressure  (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff method in conscious SHRs. Forty rats were  randomly assigned to the following five groups: control, hydrochlorothiazide  (HCT, 6.25 mg/kg), L-PA in low, middle or high dose groups (100, 250, 500 mg/kg).  SHRs were intragastrically (i. g.) administrated once daily for 28 days. The SBP  was measured once weekly during drug treatment, and 3 and 6 days after drug with  drawal. KM mice were i. g. administered with 100 mg/kg (74 MBq/kg) of 3H-L-PA.  Ten microl blood samples were obtained from the tail vein at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 min  and 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144 h after drug administration for  measuring radioactivities. Pharmacokinetics parameters of the oral administration  of L-PA were analysed with DAS 2.0 software. RESULTS: Twenty-one or 28 days after  administration, the rats in the groups treated with HCT or L-PA at 100, 250 or  500 mg/kg had a significant decrease in SBP (P<0.01 vs control group). Three or 6  days after drug withdrawal, the antihypertensive effect of HCT disappeared  (P>0.05), whereas the rats treated with 250 or 500 mg/kg L-PA still had lower SBP  than the controls (P<0.01). The L-PA at a dose of 100 mg/kg also led to a  significant decrease in SBP 3 days after drug withdrawal (P<0.05). The  pharmacokinetics of L-PA (i. g.) was consistent with a two-compartment model,  with 2.76 h of absorption half-life (t1/2, Ka), 42. 30 h of distributional  half-life (t1/2alpha), 42. 31 h of elimination half-life (t1/2beta), and 36.28 h  of terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2z). CONCLUSION: Oral administration  of L-PA has significant anti-hypertensive effect, which can be maintained to 6  days after drug withdrawal. The sustaining anti-hypertensive effect of L-PA is  probably associated with its slow elimination in vivo.","2009-07","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:24:52","","694-696, 703","","4","40","","Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 19764575","","","","Alginates/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Glucuronic Acid/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Hexuronic Acids/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy/metabolism; Male; Mice; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  Plasma concentrations of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide were  measured in 41 healthy volunteers enrolled in our bioequivalence study by  LC-MS/MS following oral administration of an olmesartan  medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide (20/12.5 mg) fixed-dose combination tablet. This  data and covariates were subjected to nonlinear mixed-effect modeling analysis  using the NONMEM software. Evaluation featured a visual predicted check and  bootstrapping. RESULTS: The distributions of olmesartan medoxomil and  hydrochlorothiazide were best fitted using a two-compartment model with no lag  time and first-order elimination. When analyzing hydrochlorothiazide kinetics, we  found that TCHO and CL/F were correlated, while. HB and Ka influenced olmesartan  medoxomil modeling.

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: Data from two Phase I clinical trials (Study A and Study B) were  combined and analyzed. Study A was an open, randomized, three-period crossover  study. Eligible healthy male Chinese volunteers were randomly assigned to receive  a single dose of the HCTZ (25 mg), BENA (20 mg) or HCTZ/BENA (25/20 mg). Study B  was an open randomized, two-period crossover study of VAL/HCTZ (160/12.5 mg) in  two formulations. A 7-day washout period was designed between alternate  formulations in both studies. Multiple blood samples were collected up to 48 h  post-dose, and plasma concentrations of HCTZ were analyzed using high performance  liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS)  system. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored and documented throughout the study  period. RESULTS: 12 subjects completed Study A and 18 subjects completed Study B.  Mean maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) was 168, 121 and 418 ng/ml and mean  exposure (AUC(0-48 h)) was 1,160, 955 and 2,801 ng × h/ml following a single dose  of HCTZ (25 mg) alone, BENA/HCTZ (20/25 mg) and VAL/HCTZ (160/12.5 mg),  respectively. There was significant decrease in C(max) (90% confidence interval:  64.4 - 78.0%) and AUC(0-48 h) (90% confidence interval: 75.9 - 89.5%) of HCTZ  with BENA co-administration, whereas concomitant VAL with HCTZ led to significant  increase (approximate 1.5-fold) in C(max) and AUC(0-48 h) of plasma HCTZ even  without dose normalizing. The apparent terminal half-life (t(1/2)) and the time  to C(max) (tmax) were unchanged between the two studies. Overall, HCTZ alone as  well as in combination with BENA and VAL was well tolerated within the scope of  the current studies in Chinese health volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: BENA decreased the  bioavailability of HCTZ in Chinese healthy volunteers while VAL greatly increased  the concentration of HCTZ in plasma during coadministration. The combination of  HCTZ with BENA or VAL was safe and well tolerated.","2011-12","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:24:54","","756-764","","12","49","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 22122818","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Benzazepines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Cross-Over Studies; Diuretics/*pharmacokinetics; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Male; Middle Aged; Tetrazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Valine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Valsartan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tablets containing the fixed  combination of lisinopril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were administered  as a single dose followed by daily administration for 6-8 days. Serum  concentration and haemodynamic measurements were made at intervals up to 48 hours  after the first and last doses. The serum profiles of both drugs were comparable  with observations from previous studies, showing higher concentrations in the  elderly and in the renally impaired patients. Similar differences have been  reported for such patient groups when the drugs were administered separately,  indicating an absence of pharmacokinetic interaction. Both drugs accumulated by  about 30% on multiple daily dosing. There were no differences between the patient  groups in the extent of accumulation. The combination of lisinopril and  hydrochlorothiazide produced the expected hypotensive response, minimum BP values  being recorded 4 and 6 hours after treatment. The higher concentrations in the  elderly and renally impaired patients were not associated with a greater  reduction in BP. The pharmacokinetic behaviour of lisinopril and  hydrochlorothiazide given together to elderly and renally impaired hypertensive  patients suggests that a fixed dose combination is appropriate and that no  changes to the dosage regimen additional to those used for the individual agents  are necessary.","1991-12","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:27:55","","77-84","","","5 Suppl 2","","J Hum Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1665183","","","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Drug Combinations; Enalapril/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Female; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Kidney Diseases/complications/*metabolism; Lisinopril; Male; Middle Aged","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan,  given alone or in combination, there were no appreciable differences in trough  plasma concentrations between days 6, 7, and 8; thus, at day 7, both agents had  achieved steady state. Mean values of the primary end points (Cmax and AUC0-24)  and secondary end points (Cmin and t1/2) for both telmisartan and  hyrochlorothiazide were unaffected when administered simultaneously. Moreover,  concurrent telmisartan had no effect on urinary excretion of hydrochlorothiazide.  Transient lightheadedness, associated with postural hypotension, was the most  common adverse event. The absence of any significant effects on the  pharmacokinetics of either hydrochlorothiazide or telmisartan shows that no dose  adjustment is required if the two agents are given concurrently for the  management of hypertension.","2000-12","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:46:39","","1323-1330","","12 Pt 1","40","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11185630","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Benzimidazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Benzoates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Interactions; Female; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Male; Middle Aged; Telmisartan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pharmacokinetic  parameters of the drug post intravenous dosing were reported for the first time.  The results of the oral administration revealed statistically significant  differences between the liquisolid and the commercial tablets in the area under  the plasma concentration-time curve, the peak plasma concentration, and the  absolute bioavailability. On the other hand, no significant differences were  observed between the two formulations with regard to the mean residence time, the  mean absorption time, and the rate of absorption. The absolute bioavailability of  the drug from the liquisolid tablets was 15% higher than that from the commercial  one. The parametric 90% confidence intervals for the different parameters were  higher than the commonly expected intervals for bioequivalency, indicating  greater bioavailability of the liquisolid tablets.","2001-07-03","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:25:52","","1-6","","1","222","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 11404027","","","","Administration, Oral; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Area Under Curve; Biological Availability; Diuretics; Dogs; Half-Life; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Injections, Intravenous; Intestinal Absorption; Male; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Tablets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antihypertensive drugs are more potent when  administered in combinations of 2 or 3 different classes of drugs. One such  therapy includes a combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium  channel blocker, and a diuretic. The objective of this study was to evaluate the  pharmacokinetic interaction among telmisartan, amlodipine, and  hydrochlorothiazide. METHODS: A randomized, open-label, 3-period, 6-sequence,  3-treatment, single-dose crossover study was conducted in healthy male subjects.  Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 sequences and one of the following  treatments was administered in each period: treatment A, co-administration of one  tablet of telmisartan 80 mg and one tablet of amlodipine 10 mg; treatment B, one  tablet of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg alone; and treatment C, co-administration of  all 3 investigational products. Serial blood samples were collected up to  144 hours postdose. Plasma drug concentrations were measured by using LC/MS-MS.  Pharmacokinetic parameters, including C(max) and AUC(0-last), were determined by  using noncompartmental analysis. The geometric least squares mean ratios and  associated 90% CIs of log-transformed C(max) and AUC(0-last) for separate  administration or co-administration were calculated to evaluate pharmacokinetic  interactions. FINDINGS: Twenty-seven subjects completed the study. The geometric  least squares mean ratios and 90% CIs of C(max) and AUC(0-last) were 1.02  (0.85-1.21) and 1.04 (0.97-1.13) for telmisartan; 1.00 (0.95-1.04) and 0.95  (0.91-0.99) for amlodipine; and 0.88 (0.82-0.96) and 0.86 (0.82-0.90) for  hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. No serious adverse events were recorded, and  all reported adverse events were of mild intensity. IMPLICATIONS: The  pharmacokinetic parameters of telmisartan, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide  when administered separately or co-administered were compared, and all the  parameters met the criteria for pharmacokinetic equivalence. Combination therapy  of these 3 drugs had no significant impact on the pharmacokinetic parameters of  each drug.

Control of blood pressure with fixed dose combination of the above drugs acting  through different mechanism have a benefit of convenient dosing in terms of  compliance, lower the dose and subsequently reduce the side effects. METHODS: The  authors investigated the relative bioavailability under a fasting state of the 3  drugs in a randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover  bioequivalence study with a washout period of 21 days. Plasma concentration of  the analytes were assayed in timed samples with a simple, highly sensitive and  rapid validated method using HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry that had a  lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL for all the 3 components. RESULTS: Test  and reference formulations gave a mean Cmax of 5.234±0.914 ng/mL and 4.991±0.563  ng/mL, 108.839±13.601 ng/mL and 114.783±12.315 ng/mL and 97.814±10.779 ng/mL and  93.731±10.018 ng/mL for amlodipine, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide  respectively. The AUC0-t of amlodipine, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide was  161.484 ng.h/mL, 1 917.644 ng.h/mL and 822.847 ng.h/mL for test formulation and  162.108 ng.h/mL, 2 014.764 ng.h/mL and 829.323 ng.h/mL for reference in the  fasting state. CONCLUSION: The 90% confidence intervals for the test/reference  ratio of the pharmacokinetic parameters in fasting state (mean Cmax, AUC0-t, and  AUC0-∞) were within the acceptable range of 80.00-125.00.

Zolmitriptan has vasoconstrictor activity in cerebral vessels and may  cause slight elevations of blood pressure in subjects without hypertension.  Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolmitriptan (5, 10, and  20 mg) were evaluated in 16 patients with mild to moderate hypertension  (controlled by hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg once daily) and 17 healthy age- and  sex-matched control subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,  four-period crossover study. The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its  metabolites were dose proportional. Although area under the concentration-time  curve (AUC0-infinity) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were slightly higher in  patients with hypertension at all doses, this was only statistically significant  for AUC at the 20-mg dose. Differences between subjects with and without  hypertension were not clinically significant. Zolmitriptan produced a small  increase in blood pressure, but this was similar in subjects with and without  hypertension and was of no clinical significance. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated  in both groups. Zolmitriptan plasma concentrations were higher in women than in  men, with higher values of AUC and Cmax and lower total clearance in women. These  results indicate that zolmitriptan can be administered for treatment of migraine  in patients with controlled hypertension without dose adjustment.","1998-08","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:42:43","","685-693","","8","38","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9725543","","","","*Oxazolidinones; Area Under Curve; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Cross-Over Studies; Diuretics; Double-Blind Method; Female; Heart Rate/drug effects; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Male; Middle Aged; Oxazoles/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Serotonin Receptor Agonists/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Tryptamines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to drug-drug interaction potentials, in the current study we  aimed to evaluate potent effects of HCT and AML on pharmacokinetics (PKs) of VAL  when they are orally co-administered as FDC (VAL/HCT at 80/12.5 mg or  160/12.5 mg; and VAL/AML at 160/5 mg or 160/10 mg) products in healthy Korean  subjects. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and analysis were performed by  the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software. PKs of VAL was described by  two-compartment disposition model, first-order elimination, four-sequential  first-order absorption model, correlation between apparent clearances and volumes  of distribution, and lag time. For all FDCs, there were no statistically  significant differences in both maximum concentration and areas under the  concentration-time curves (AUCs) of VAL in comparison to those when administered  VAL alone, except the combination of VAL/AML at 160/10 mg, where AUC(0-∞)  increased by 11.8% in mean and 6.86% in median. In addition, there was an  increasing trend in time to reach peak (T(max)) of VAL in FDCs, where it was  increased by 0.22-0.34 h in mean and 0.40-0.44 h in median, except the  combination of VAL/HCT at 160/12.5 mg. However, these differences in AUC(0-∞) and  T(max) might not be considered as clinically important. In conclusion, HCT or AML  has no potent effect on PKs of VAL when they are co-administered as FDC products.  No dose adjustment for VAL is recommended when co-administered with HCT or AML.","2018-06-15","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:32:53","","154-164","","","118","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A population-based meta-analysis approach in  NONMEM® was used to develop a PK model to characterize the time-course of HCTZ  concentrations in plasma and excretion into the urine for healthy subjects and  CHF patients. Data from healthy subjects receiving 100 mg of oral HCTZ were  supplemented with additional plasma concentration and urinary excretion versus  time data published in the literature following administration of oral HCTZ doses  ranging from 10 to 500 mg to healthy subjects or patients with renal failure, CHF  or hypertension. A two-compartment model with first-order oral absorption, using  a Weibull function, and first-order elimination best described HCTZ PK.  Creatinine clearance (CLCR ) was a statistically significant predictor of renal  clearance (CLR ). Non-renal clearance was estimated to be 2.44 l/h, CLR was  18.3 l/h and T1/2,α was 1.6 h and T1/2,β was 14.8 h for a typical individual with  normal renal function (CLCR  = 120 ml/min). However, CLR was reduced to 10.5,  5.47 and 2.70 l/h in mild (CLCR  = 80 ml/min), moderate (CLCR  = 50 ml/min) and  severe (CLCR  = 30 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively. Model diagnostics  helped to demonstrate that the population PK model reasonably predicts the rate  of urinary HCTZ excretion over time using dosing history and estimated CLCR ,  allowing for the convenient assessment of PK-PD relationships for HCTZ when given  alone or in combination with other agents used to treat fluid overload  conditions.","2013-12","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:44:57","","527-539","","9","34","","Biopharm Drug Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24123104","","","","*Models, Biological; Adult; Antihypertensive Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Benzazepines/pharmacology; Diuretics/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; heart failure; Heart Failure/blood/urine; Humans; hydrochlorothiazide; Hydrochlorothiazide/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Hypertension/blood/urine; Male; Middle Aged; population pharmacokinetics; Renal Insufficiency/blood/urine; Tolvaptan; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) promotes sodium excretion, resulting in a reduction of  plasma volume and peripheral resistance. A combination of these agents is known  to have a greater effect for the treatment of hypertension than monotherapy with  either one of these components. OBJECTIVE: To assess bioequivalence between  fixed-dose combination of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in  healthy Korean subjects. METHODS: 40 healthy Korean volunteers were randomized  into two groups. After administration of a single dose of investigational  products, blood samples were collected before study drug administration  (baseline) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 36 hours after  study drug administration. The plasma concentrations of olmesartan and HCTZ were  measured by LC-MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated, and the 90%  confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratio (test/reference) of the  parameters were obtained by analysis of variance (ANOVA) on logarithmically  transformed data. RESULTS: The corresponding 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratio  of the test to reference drugs were 0.93 - 1.04, 0.93 - 1.04, and 0.95 - 1.10.  For HCTZ treatments, the 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratio of test to  reference drugs were 0.95 - 1.03 for AUClast, 0.96 - 1.03 for AUC∞, and 0.89 -  1.04 for Cmax.

As  aliskiren does not affect cytochrome P450 enzyme activities, is minimally  metabolised, and is not extensively protein bound, the potential for drug  interactions is predicted to be low. Four open-label studies investigated the  pharmacokinetic interactions between aliskiren 300 mg and the antihypertensive  drugs amlodipine 10 mg (n = 18), valsartan 320 mg (n = 18), hydrochlorothiazide  25 mg (HCTZ, n = 22) and ramipril 10 mg (n = 17) in healthy subjects. In each  study, subjects received multiple once-daily doses of aliskiren and the test  antihypertensive drug alone or in combination in two dosing periods separated by  a drug-free washout period. Plasma concentrations of drugs were determined by  liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry methods. At steady state, relatively  small changes in exposure to aliskiren were observed when aliskiren was  co-administered with amlodipine (AUC(tau) increased by 29%, p = 0.032), ramipril  (C(max,ss) increased by 31%, p = 0.043), valsartan (AUC(tau) decreased by 26%, p  = 0.002) and HCTZ (C(max,ss) decreased by 22%, p = 0.039). Co-administration with  aliskiren resulted in small changes in exposure to ramipril (AUC(tau) increased  by 22%, p = 0.002), valsartan (AUC(tau) decreased by 14%, p = 0.062) and HCTZ  (AUC(tau) decreased by 10% and C(max,ss) by 26%, both p < 0.001). All other  changes in pharmacokinetic parameters were also small, and not statistically  significant. None of the observed pharmacokinetic changes was considered  clinically relevant. Aliskiren inhibited plasma renin activity (PRA) and also  prevented the reactive rise in PRA induced by valsartan. The most commonly  reported adverse events were headache, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms  (all mild in severity), which were similar in frequency during antihypertensive  drug treatment alone and in combination with aliskiren except for an increase in  dizziness during treatment with the combination of aliskiren and HCTZ.

A significant increase in the extent, but not the rate, of absorption  of hydrochlorothiazide was observed for the combination tablet (mean Fr, 120%),  which is not considered clinically significant.

Twenty-four volunteers  participated and all completed the study successfully. Lisinopril and  hydrochlorothiazide were determined in plasma by HPLC. The pharmacokinetic  parameters AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), Cmax and Cmax/AUC(0-infinity) were tested  for bioequivalence after logarithmic transformation of data and ratios of tmax  were evaluated non-parametrically. RESULTS: For lisinopril, the parametric  analysis revealed the following test/reference ratios and their confidence  intervals (90% CI): 1.01 (0.84-1.22) for AUC(0-t), 0.98 (0.81-1.19) for  AUC(0-infinity), 1.02 (0.83-1.25) for Cmax and 1.03 (0.99-1.08) for  Cmax/AUC(0-infinity).

Twelve patients (age range, 35-55 years; mean age, 44  years) were allocated to treatment. Drug interactions were evaluated by comparing  the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for losartan and its  active metabolite, E-3174, when losartan (50 mg) was given alone or in  combination with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. The urinary recovery over the  24-hour period of hydrochlorothiazide was compared for hydrochlorothiazide (12.5  mg) given alone or in combination with 50 mg losartan. A clinically significant  interaction was defined as a treatment difference of more than 35%. There was no  evidence of a clinically significant effect of hydrochlorothiazide on the  pharmacokinetics of losartan or E-3174, as the geometric mean AUC24 ratio (90%  confidence interval [CI]) was 1.02 (0.95, 1.09) for losartan and 1.02 (0.96,  1.09) for E-3174.

The key factor of the  bioinequivalence might be that dissolution of valsartan in acid medium has marked  difference between two preparations.","2014-04","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:37:44","","524-529","","4","49","","Yao Xue Xue Bao","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 24974472","","","","Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Area Under Curve; Chromatography, Liquid; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Liberation; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics; Male; Tablets; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Therapeutic Equivalency; Valsartan/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better understand the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of  fidarestat, we have evaluated plasma protein binding, pharmacokinetics, tissue  distribution of the drug and its conjugated metabolites and CYP450  biotransformation by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry.  Effective chromatographic separation of fidarestat and hydrochlorothiazide (IS)  in rat plasma and tissues was achieved on Hypersil gold C-18 column in an  isocratic elution mode. For detection, a high-resolution Orbitrap mass  spectrometer with heated electrospray ionization inlet in the negative ion mode  was used. High-resolution extracted ion chromatograms for each analyte were  obtained by processing the full-scan MS mode with 5 ppm mass tolerance. The  impact of plasma protein binding with the drug and conjugated metabolites of the  drug on pharmacokinetics has been determined. The study indicated that 9.5% of  free form of fidarestat may be pharmacologically active and the Cmax for free  fidarestat was found to be 80.30 ± 6.78 ng/mL. The AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were found  to be 185.46 ± 32 and 195.92 ± 15.06 ng h/mL, respectively. Among tissues, the  maximum observed distribution was found to be in kidney followed by liver and  heart. Docking experiments and in vitro CYP450 reaction phenotyping revealed that  two CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are involved in the phase I metabolism of fidarestat.  Oxidative deamination and N/O glucuronidation are the major phase I and phase II  metabolites, respectively. In vitro CYP450 inhibition assay of fidarestat for  drug-drug interaction showed weak inhibition and may not alter pharmacokinetics,  distribution or clearance of other co-administered drug.","2015-01","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 13:29:32","","386-399","","","102","","J Pharm Biomed Anal","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, although  triamterene is mostly applied concomitantly with thiazide-type diuretics the  interaction of triamterene (TA) with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is subject to a  controversial discussion. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the  dose linearity of TA and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of  triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. In the first study 10 healthy volunteers  received 0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg triamterene orally in a balanced crossover  design. In the second study 0, 25, and 50 mg TA with 12.5, and 25 mg HCT,  respectively, were administered to 12 healthy volunteers. Urine volume and  concentration of sodium, TA, hydroxytriamterene sulfate (OH-TA ester), and HCT  were measured by flame photometry and thin-layer chromatography, respectively.  The observation period for each treatment was 3 days and the drug was given on  the second day. Sodium excretion was increased by both drugs. Renal excretion of  both TA and OH-TA ester seemed to be reduced at higher doses. However,  statistical evaluation revealed no significant (p = 0.37, and p = 0.20,  respectively) deviation from linearity. Renal excretion of HCT was not affected  by TA and vice versa. However, renal excretion of OH-TA ester is significantly  reduced when HCT is administered concomitantly. The renal excretion rate of  sodium can be described by a common Emax model when the effects of the excretion  rates of both TA and HCT are additive. It is concluded that the pharmacokinetics  of TA is linear within the tested dose range and that pharmacodynamic additivity  of HCT and TA is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. The results support  the hypothesis of a sequential nephron blockade for both drugs acting on  different tubular segments.","1997-10","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:32:08","","447-452","","10","35","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 9352394","","","","Adult; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Cross-Over Studies; Diuretics/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Drug Interactions; Female; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Kidney Tubules/drug effects; Linear Models; Male; Sodium/urine; Triamterene/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with CLO preparations,  ZJAHC shows improved activities and decreased adverse effects. It is believed  that the side effects of CLO are caused by its high peak plasma concentration.  Hence, study of the influence of ZJAHC on the pharmacokinetic behaviors of  clonidine seems essential. In present study, the plasma concentrations of CLO  were determined with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)  method. The MS/MS transitions monitored for clonidine and internal standard were  230.2 → 213.1 and 152.2 → 110.2, respectively. The analyte was quantified in a  single run within 3 min. The pharmacokinetic study showed that the area under the  plasma concentration-time curve of CLO in ZJAHC (60 µg/kg CLO) was similar to  that of CLO-HCT-high (120 µg/kg CLO) but the peak concentration was much lower  than that in CLO-HCT-high. ZJAHC could enhance the bioavailability without  greatly increasing peak concentration of clonidine. This comprehensive effect of  enhancing the bioavailability and avoiding the high peak plasma concentration for  CLO might mainly result from the co-contribution of Western medicine and  traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), while the effect of TCM was stronger than  that of Western medicine.","2015-07","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:34:58","","1068-1075","","7","29","","Biomed Chromatogr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25516086","","","","Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Chromatography, Liquid/*methods; clonidine; Clonidine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Drugs, Chinese Herbal/administration & dosage/analysis/*pharmacokinetics; LC-MS/MS; Linear Models; pharmacokinetics; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods; TCM; Zhenju antihypertensive compound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of garlic on pharmacokinetics of HCTZ was studied by  HPLC method, while pharmacodynamic interaction was studied using diuretic  activity, ECG and BP changes and isoproterenol (ISO) induced myocardial injury.  HCTZ was given orally at 10mg/kg and GH was administered at three different doses  of 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o. The CK-MB, LDH, SOD, catalase and  histopathological studies were carried out. The administration of HCTZ in GH  pretreated rats found to decrease the QRS duration, RR interval, QT segment,  systolic blood pressure, heart rate, serum potassium level, serum LDH and serum  CK-MB activities significantly. The diuretic effect of HCTZ was significantly  increased in presence of GH; however, kaliuresis was significantly reduced in  presence of GH 250 mg/kg. Histopathological studies of heart tissue reveal the  protective effect of GH 250 mg/kg in presence or absence of HCTZ during ISO  stress to myocardium. The pharmacokinetic studies show that GH increases the  bioavailability and half-life, along with decrease in clearance and elimination  rate of HCTZ when administered orally. It was concluded that careful addition of  garlic in moderate doses might result in beneficial effect during treatment of  hypertension in patients with myocardial stress as garlic causes substantial fall  in excretion of potassium when compared to HCTZ alone treatment in rats. This  could be important in reducing the dose of HCTZ to achieve enhanced therapeutic  effect with minimal adverse effect.","2009-10-30","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 13:28:04","","472-479","","3","181","","Chem Biol Interact","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 19660444","","","","*Food-Drug Interactions; *Garlic; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Area Under Curve; Blood Pressure; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electrocardiography; Electrolytes/urine; Female; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Rats; Rats, Wistar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(Family Malvaceae) are very popular for the preparation of homemade refreshing drinks and are also used medicinally for a  variety of ailments. Particularly remarkable are the various scientific reports  supporting diuretic and antihypertensive potentials. It is therefore not unusual  for patients who are on orthodox antihypertensive medications to use medicinal H.  sabdariffa drinks concomitantly without regard to the possibility of herb-drug  interactions. This possibility necessitated this study in which the  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of H. sabdariffa extract (HSE)  and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), a commonly prescribed diuretic drug, were  examined. The effects of concomitant administration of HSE on urine volume, urine  pH, and urinary concentrations of sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride ions, as well  as on the pharmacokinetic parameters of HCT, were determined in experimental rats  and rabbits. Co-administration of HSE with HCT caused a significant increase in  the volume of urine excreted and resulted in a decrease in the pH of urine and  the concentrations of sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride ions. Co-administration  of HSE (20-40 mg/kg) with HCT (10 mg/kg) increased and prolonged the plasma  concentration, the mean area under the concentration-time curve, and the volume  of distribution of HCT achieved over the 24-hour sampling period. The plasma  clearance and the elimination rate constant of HCT decreased with increasing dose  of HSE co-administered with the HCT. The results of this study reveal a possible  herb-drug interaction involving HCT and HSE, used as an ingredient in medicinal  or refreshing drinks in many countries.","2011-06","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:32:46","","640-644","","6","14","","J Med Food","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21480802","","","","*Herb-Drug Interactions; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Hibiscus/*chemistry; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Male; Mice; Plant Extracts/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Rabbits; Rats; Urination/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling was applied to  investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between  irbesartan and HCTZ in renal hypertensive dogs at non-steady-state and  steady-state. The renal hypertensive dogs were treated with oral irbesartan  alone, or HCTZ alone, or the combination of irbesartan and HCTZ for 8 days. Blood  pressure and plasma concentrations were measured and  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters were analyzed. Irbesartan showed a  two-compartment model pharmacokinetic profile. The concentration-time course of  irbesartan was not changed by HCTZ, but irbesartan increased the peak plasma  concentration and area under the curve of HCTZ at steady-state. HCTZ had no blood  pressure lowering effect at non-steady-state. Irbesartan plus HCTZ had greater  blood pressure lowering action than irbesartan alone. HCTZ increased actions of  irbesartan. Hysteresis loops were found between effect and plasma concentrations  of irbesartan after a single dose. However, hysteresis loops disappeared at  steady state with more rapid realization of maximum concentration and effects.  The relationship between effects and effect-compartment concentrations of the  drugs was represented by a sigmoid Emax model. The results suggest synergistic  pharmacodynamic interaction between irbesartan and HCTZ in renal hypertensive  dogs and some differences of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties between  irbesartan and irbesartan/HCTZ combinations at non-steady-state and steady state.","2005-12","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:23:50","","863-869","","6","46","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16306814","","","","Animals; Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Dogs; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Hydrochlorothiazide/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Hypertension, Renal/*drug therapy; Irbesartan; Models, Biological; Tetrazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Saliva and plasma samples were  collected for 3-5 half-life values of sitagliptin, cinacalcet, metformin,  montelukast, tolterodine, hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), lornoxicam, azithromycin,  diacerhein, rosuvastatin, cloxacillin, losartan and tamsulosin after oral dosing.  Saliva and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental  analysis using the Kinetica program. Effective intestinal permeability (Peff)  values were estimated by the Nelder-Mead algorithm of the Parameter Estimation  module using the SimCYP program. Peff values were optimized to predict the actual  average plasma profile of each drug. All other physicochemical factors were kept  constant during the minimization processes. Sitagliptin, cinacalcet, metformin,  tolterodine, HCT, azithromycin, rosuvastatin and cloxacillin had salivary  excretion with correlation coefficients of 0.59-0.99 between saliva and plasma  concentrations. On the other hand, montelukast, lornoxicam, diacerhein, losartan  and tamsulosin showed no salivary excretion. Estimated Peff ranged 0.16-44.16 ×  10(-4) cm/s, while reported fraction unbound to plasma proteins (fu) ranged  0.01-0.99 for the drugs under investigation. Saliva/plasma concentrations ratios  ranged 0.11-13.4, in agreement with drug protein binding and permeability. A  Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS) was suggested based on drug high  (H)/low (L) permeability and high (H)/low (L) fraction unbound to plasma  proteins, which classifies drugs into 4 classes. Drugs that fall into class I  (H/H), II (L/H) or III (H/L) are subjected to salivary excretion, while those  falling into class IV (L/L) are not. Additional data from literature was also  analyzed, and all results were in agreement with the suggested SECS. Moreover, a  polynomial relationship with correlation coefficient of 0.99 is obtained between  S* and C*, where S* and C* are saliva and concentration dimensionless numbers  respectively. The proposed Salivary Excretion Classification System (SECS) can be  used as a guide for drug salivary excretion. Future work is planned to test these  initial findings, and demonstrate SECS robustness across a range of carefully  selected (based on physicochemical properties) drugs that fall into classes I, II  or III.","2012-08-06","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:24:05","","2358-2363","","8","9","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22784220","","","","Acetates/blood/pharmacokinetics; Anthraquinones/blood/pharmacokinetics; Azithromycin/blood/pharmacokinetics; Benzhydryl Compounds/blood/pharmacokinetics; Cinacalcet; Cloxacillin/blood/pharmacokinetics; Cresols/blood/pharmacokinetics; Cyclopropanes; Female; Fluorobenzenes/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/blood/pharmacokinetics; Losartan/blood/pharmacokinetics; Male; Metformin/blood/pharmacokinetics; Naphthalenes/blood/pharmacokinetics; Phenylpropanolamine/blood/pharmacokinetics; Piroxicam/analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; Pyrazines/blood/pharmacokinetics; Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Quinolines/blood/pharmacokinetics; Rosuvastatin Calcium; Saliva/*metabolism; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Sulfides; Sulfonamides/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Tamsulosin; Tolterodine Tartrate; Triazoles/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantification of CAN and HCTZ in biological matrices has traditionally been  difficult - developing a single method with the desired sensitivity has been the  issue. RESULTS: A high-throughput bioanalytical method for the analysis of CAN  and HCTZ in human plasma using liquid-liquid extraction and LC coupled to  negative ion mode MS/MS has been developed and validated according to US FDA  guidelines. The method uses 100 µl plasma and covers the calibration range 1-160  ng/ml for CAN and 2-160 ng/ml for HCTZ for routine pharmacokinetic studies in  humans. The intra- and inter-day precision values for CAN and HCTZ met the  acceptance criteria. CAN and HCTZ were stable in a battery of stability studies  (benchtop, autosampler and long-term). CONCLUSION: The advantages of the  described technique included a single method with a shorter run time (2.5 min),  simple extraction technique, LLOQ of 1 ng/ml for CAN and 2 ng/ml for HCTZ and  lower sample volume (0.10 ml), which overcomes drawbacks of two single methods  for each analyte, such as higher analysis time, LOQ and sample volume, as in  previously published methods.

An  aliquot of plasma (50 microl) was mixed with the solution of internal standard,  hydrofluorothiazide (HFTZ), and extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether. The  reconstituted extract was applied to the LC-MS/MS system with a reversed phase C8  column and eluted with distilled water/acetonitrile (85/15, v/v). To enhance  negative ionization of HCTZ and HFTZ in the multiple reaction monitor (MRM), the  solution consisting of acetonitlile/1% (v/v) ammonia solution (95/5, v/v) was  delivered after column separation. This additional technique, so-called the  post-column addition, increased sensitivity of HCTZ and HFTZ about 500- and  200-fold, respectively. The calibration curve showed good linearity (r = 0.999)  over the range of 4-1000 ng/ml. Acceptable accuracy (100.8-113.1%) and precision  (0.28-16.4%) were confirmed in the intra- and the inter-day analyses. It is  indicated that this LC-MS/MS method is useful for pharmacokinetic studies of HCTZ  in small animals, because it enabled the serial determination of plasma level of  HCTZ in rats.","2004-07-05","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:43:45","","199-203","","2","806","","J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 15171930","","","","Animals; Area Under Curve; Chromatography, Liquid/*methods; Diuretics; Hydrochlorothiazide/*blood/pharmacokinetics; Rats; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/*blood/pharmacokinetics; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A.","Valsartan: a novel angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist.","Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy","","1465-6566","10.1517/14656566.1.2.337","","Valsartan is a highly selective, orally available antagonist of the angiotensin Type 1 (AT1) receptor. It is indicated for treatment of mild to moderate  essential hypertension. Experimental studies have confirmed the abolition or  attenuation of angiotensin II (AII)-related effects, such as vasoconstriction,  cell growth promotion and aldosterone release. In humans, valsartan is rapidly  absorbed with maximal plasma concentrations occurring 1-2 h after oral  administration. The elimination half-life comes to about 7-8 h, valsartan is  metabolised to a negligible extent and most of the drug is excreted via the  faeces. There is no dose adjustment required for patients with a creatinine  clearance > 10 ml/min. The dose should not exceed 80 mg o.d. in patients with  hepatic dysfunction, valsartan is not recommended for patients with severe  hepatic dysfunction and/or biliary cirrhosis. At present, no clinically relevant  pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been observed. Valsartan produces  persistent blood pressure reductions in patients with mild to moderate  hypertension, the recommended starting dose is 80 mg o.d. If required, the dose  may either be increased to 160 mg o.d. or hydrochlorothiazide may be added. In  comparison to other antihypertensive drugs valsartan therapy leads to similar  blood pressure reductions, while exhibiting a favourable tolerability profile.  Preliminary studies suggest beneficial effects in patients with hypertensive  end-organ damage such as renal disease and left ventricular hypertrophy.  Furthermore, the drug is evaluated for its efficacy in heart failure and patients  post-myocardial infarction.","2000-01","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:49:31","","337-350","","2","1","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11249553","","","","*Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin II/metabolism; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Clinical Trials as Topic; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Humans; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2; Tetrazoles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Valine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Valsartan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic interactions of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-blocker  propranolol in healthy volunteers and patients with essential hypertension. We  also evaluated the effect of cilazapril on aortic compliance in hypertension by  pulse-wave velocity along the aorta. We showed that single oral doses of  cilazapril 4 mg, captopril 25 mg, or enalapril 10 mg shifted the angiotensin I  dose-effect curve to the right and determined a pharmacologic half-life of about  4 h for cilazapril. Increasing single oral doses (1.25, 3.75, 10, and 30 mg) of  cilazapril reduced diastolic blood pressure dose-dependently and shifted the  angiotensin I dose-response curves to the right. The dose representing 50%  inhibition of ACE activity (apparent Ki dose) was about 0.6 mg 3 h after  cilazapril administration. Cilazapril and propranolol did not exhibit significant  pharmacokinetic interaction in healthy volunteers; each drug reduced diastolic  and systolic blood pressure by about 7 mm Hg, and this was doubled by the  combination. Monotherapy with each drug reduced blood pressure, and combined  administration enhanced the antihypertensive effect.

METHODOLOGY: The  candidate drugs were loaded in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) by  emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method. The formulations were evaluated for their  size, morphology, drug loading and in-vitro release individually. Repeat dose  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the nano-fixed dose combination  (FDC) was done in dexamethasone-induced animal model. RESULTS: The entrapment  efficiencies ranged from 44 ± 2.1, 32.2 ± 4 and 40.5 ± 2.6% for amlodipine,  hydrochlorothiazide and CNDT, respectively. The nanoparticles ranged in size from  164 to 215 nm.

Studies  were conducted in vitro and in healthy female mongrel dogs using two different  grades of HPMC, i.e. K8515 HPMC and ultra high molecular weight (UHMW) HPMC. The  maximum plasma concentration, Cmax, of paracetamol and both the Cmax and the area  under the concentration-time curve, AUC, of cimetidine were significantly  decreased by the coadministration of 10 g of K8515 HPMC or 7.5 g of UHMW HPMC  dissolved in 500 mL normal saline under fasting conditions. No statistically  significant effects were observed on hydrochlorothiazide or mefenamic acid  absorption. Based on in vitro data and previous studies it appears that  reductions in gastric emptying and dissolution rate of paracetamol account for  the effect observed in vivo. For cimetidine, a drug which can be absorbed from  both the small and the large intestine, the indigestibility of HPMC in the colon  in addition to the great reduction of dissolution rate led to reductions of both  the Cmax and AUC values. The long Tmax values, even in the absence of HPMCs and  the more modest reduction of the dissolution rate of hydrochlorothiazide by the  HPMCs are thought to have precluded the observation of any significant  alterations in the in vivo absorption profile. Owing to its erratic absorption,  no statistically based conclusion could be drawn about the effects of  coadministered HPMC on the oral absorption of the poorly soluble mefenamic acid.  It is concluded that the effects of HPMCs on drug absorption in dogs are most  pronounced for compounds with absorption profiles that are dependent on gastric  emptying, i.e. compounds that are highly water soluble and that exhibit short  Tmax values. Compounds with long absorption profiles appear to be less  susceptible to changes in absorption behavior due to coadministration of HPMCs.","1998-11","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:35:30","","523-530","","8","19","","Biopharm Drug Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9840214","","","","Animals; Anticholesteremic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Area Under Curve; Diffusion; Dogs; Drug Interactions; Hypromellose Derivatives; Intestinal Absorption/*drug effects; Methylcellulose/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Solubility; Solutions; Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Like  enalapril and ramipril it is a prodrug, and is hydrolysed after absorption to  cilazaprilat, which has a long terminal phase elimination half-life permitting  once daily administration. Given once daily at doses between 2.5 and 5 mg,  cilazapril reduces arterial blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate  essential and renal hypertension. Patients who do not respond adequately to  cilazapril monotherapy usually respond with the addition of a diuretic such as  hydrochlorothiazide. Preliminary data suggest that cilazapril is of comparable  antihypertensive efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide,  slow release propranolol, nitrendipine, captopril and enalapril. In small studies  cilazapril has produced sustained beneficial haemodynamic effects in patients  with congestive heart failure.

However, data to support this perception are limited. METHODS: To  investigate whether distal diuretics are noninferior to dietary sodium  restriction in reducing BP in patients with CKD stage G3 or G4 and hypertension,  we conducted a 6-week, randomized, open-label crossover trial comparing  amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide (5 mg/50 mg daily) with dietary sodium restriction  (60 mmol per day). Antihypertension medication was discontinued for a 2-week  period before randomization. We analyzed effects on BP, kidney function, and  fluid balance and related this to renal clearance of diuretics. RESULTS: A total  of 26 patients (with a mean eGFR of 39 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) completed both  treatments. Dietary sodium restriction reduced sodium excretion from 160 to 64  mmol per day. Diuretics produced a greater reduction in 24-hour systolic BP (SBP;  from 138 to 124 mm Hg) compared with sodium restriction (from 134 to 129 mm Hg),  as well as a significantly greater effect on extracellular water, eGFR, plasma  renin, and aldosterone. Both interventions resulted in a similar decrease in body  weight and NT-proBNP. Neither approaches decreased albuminuria significantly,  whereas diuretics did significantly reduce urinary angiotensinogen and  β2-microglobulin excretion. Although lower eGFR and higher plasma indoxyl sulfate  correlated with lower diuretic clearance, the diuretic effects on body weight and  BP at lower eGFR were maintained. During diuretic treatment, higher PGE2  excretion correlated with lower free water clearance, and four patients developed  mild hyponatremia. CONCLUSIONS: Distal diuretics are noninferior to dietary  sodium restriction in reducing BP and extracellular volume in CKD. Diuretic  sensitivity in CKD is maintained despite lower diuretic clearance.

Underlying mechanisms  may involve altered angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor pharmacokinetics. We  hypothesized that the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide causes increased steady-state  levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors lisinopril and zofenopril  in rats with myocardial infarction. Rats were subjected to coronary ligation to  induce myocardial infarction. After 1 week, rats were randomized to 50 mg/kg/day  hydrochlorothiazide or control treatment for 3 weeks. The last week, rats  received lisinopril or zofenopril in equipotentent dosages (3.3 and 10 mg/kg/day,  respectively). Rats were sacrificed at Tmax after the last dose of  angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, and tissues were collected for analysis  of drug concentrations. Lisinopril concentrations in plasma were significantly  increased by hydrochlorothiazide, at unchanged tissue concentrations. This  increase could be fully explained by decreased renal function, as evidenced by  increased plasma creatinine levels (lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide 82+/-5  microM versus lisinopril 61+/-5 microM, P < 0.001). In contrast, zofenoprilat  levels in kidney and non-infarcted left ventricle were markedly increased by  hydrochlorothiazide, whereas plasma concentrations were unchanged. Although  hydrochlorothiazide tended to increase plasma creatinine in zofenopril-treated  rats as well, this increase was less pronounced (zofenopril + hydrochlorothiazide  61+/-3 microM versus zofenopril 54+/-2 microM, P = 0.15). Hydrochlorothiazide  increases steady-state angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor drug levels, most  likely by affecting their renal clearance. Notably, the lipophilic  angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor zofenopril accumulated in tissue, whereas  the hydrophilic lisinopril increased in plasma. Whether combining different  angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors with hydrochlorothiazide translates into  distinct clinical profiles requires further study.","2005-12-19","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:46:00","","141-149","","1-3","527","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 16310764","","","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Animals; Captopril/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Creatinine/blood; Drug Therapy, Combination; Heart Ventricles/drug effects; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacology; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/blood/drug therapy; Kidney Function Tests; Kidney/drug effects/physiology; Lisinopril/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Male; Myocardial Infarction/*blood/drug therapy; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood; Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Ventricular Function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the arterial vasodilatation,  only slight increases in heart rate occurred during cilazapril administration.  Cilazapril had no acute effect on cardiovascular reflexes, and increased  effective renal plasma flow slightly. Glomerular filtration rate remained  unaltered. A close positive correlation was found between the cilazaprilat plasma  concentration and degree of ACE inhibition. The potency of cilazaprit, defined as  the concentration of cilazaprilat causing 50% inhibition of ACE, was  approximately 1 microgram/L plasma. In short term studies in patients with  hypertension, it appeared that more than 90% inhibition of plasma ACE was needed  to obtain blood pressure reduction.

METHOD: The study, which took place  in an outpatient research clinic of a university hospital, used a double-blind,  placebo-controlled crossover design. The subjects were normal, healthy male  volunteers who responded to recruitment announcements. Thirteen subjects entered  and completed the study. All subjects took lithium, 300 mg b.i.d., for 6 weeks.  Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg b.i.d.; furosemide, 20 mg b.i.d.; and placebo were  given during weeks 2, 4, and 6 in a random order of assignment. Serum lithium  levels and indices of diuretic activity were measured during each week. RESULTS:  The subjects' serum lithium levels after 5 days of taking hydrochlorothiazide  were significantly higher than after 5 days of taking furosemide and placebo. At  the doses studied, hydrochlorothiazide was also more potent than furosemide in  increasing plasma renin activity, increasing sodium excretion, and decreasing  lithium excretion. CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences between diuretics in  effects on serum lithium may have been due to differences in the potency of the  diuretics at the doses studied as well as in the site of action of the diuretic  effect. The results must be interpreted cautiously, however, because the effects  were small and of questionable clinical significance, and the study used healthy  volunteers and low doses of lithium instead of psychiatric patients and the usual  therapeutic levels of lithium.","1991-08","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 13:33:30","","1060-1063","","8","148","","Am J Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1853956","","","","Adult; Double-Blind Method; Drug Interactions; Furosemide/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Lithium/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Male; Placebos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  PK parameters of irbesartan were not affected by hydrochlorothiazide; however  irbesartan decreased the hydrochlorothiazide AUC by 25% and increased its  clearance by 25%. There were no significant changes in heart rate after each drug  alone or in combination. Irbesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide had a greater blood  pressure lowering effect compared with irbesartan alone, despite the unchanged  irbesartan PK. The relationship between irbesartan plasma concentration and its  effects plotted in chronological order showed anticlockwise hysteresis. The PD  parameter estimates for the effect of irbesartan on systolic blood pressure, when  administered with hydrochlorothiazide were significantly different from those  when irbesartan was administered alone. This was manifested by a 25% increase in  Emax , and a 40% decrease in EC50 , suggesting a synergistic blood pressure  lowering effect for the combination. While parameter estimates for the effect of  irbesartan on diastolic blood pressure were changed by hydrochlorothiazide, the  differences were only significant for EC50 . CONCLUSION: A limited potential for  clinically significant interactions between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide at  the given doses were observed; therefore, no dosage adjustments were recommended  for either drug when used together.

Daily  intraperitoneal injections of captopril (10 mg/kg) reduced alcohol intake, but  the combination of captopril (5 and 10 mg/kg) and hydrochlorothiazide (2.5, 5,  and 10 mg/kg) enhanced the reduction in intake. In experiment 2, captopril alone,  hydrochlorothiazide alone, and the combination of captopril and  hydrochlorothiazide were again administered daily in the limited access  procedure. Captopril (10 mg/kg) again reduced alcohol intake as did all three  doses of hydrochlorothiazide (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg). Compared with the individual  effects of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, Capozide exerted a supra-additive  reduction in alcohol intake. These effects were not due to drug-induced changes  in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol. Taken together these results demonstrate an  enhanced potency of Capozide in suppressing alcohol intake and invite their  testing in a population of hypertensive alcoholics and alcohol abusers.","1993-10","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:35:58","","951-957","","5","17","","Alcohol Clin Exp Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8279680","","","","Alcohol Drinking/*physiopathology; Animals; Captopril/*pharmacology; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drinking/drug effects/physiology; Drug Combinations; Drug Therapy, Combination; Ethanol/pharmacokinetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacology; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike other ACE inhibitors, fosinoprilat  has a compensatory dual route of elimination and is cleared by the liver and  kidneys. Thus, in patients with diminished renal function increased hepatic  clearance of fosinoprilat is noted and, similarly, in patients with diminished  hepatic function increased renal clearance seems to occur. Because of this  compensatory elimination, fosinopril therapy for all patients can begin with the  same recommended dosage. Fosinopril 10 to 40mg administered once daily is an  effective antihypertensive regimen that has shown efficacy similar to that of  enalapril 5 to 10 mg/day, propranolol 80 to 160 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 to  50 mg/day and sustained release nifedipine 40 mg/day in preliminary clinical  trials. Generally, fosinopril is well tolerated and adverse events associated  with the drug are usually mild and similar to those associated with other ACE  inhibitors. Thus, fosinopril appears to be a useful alternative to certain  'established' agents used for treating patients with essential hypertension.","1992-01","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:32:21","","123-140","","1","43","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1372856","","","","Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Fosinopril; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Proline/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the clearance experiments, cicletanine was tested at three  different doses (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg i.v.). The drug dose-dependently increased  urine flow, and urinary sodium and chloride excretion. Renal potassium excretion  was also significantly enhanced. Cicletanine was as effective as  hydrochlorothiazide regarding fractional renal sodium excretion. Mean arterial  blood pressure fell after cicletanine at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg, but at none of  the three doses tested did cicletanine affect renal plasma flow and glomerular  filtration rate.

A coadministration of cicletanine (20 mg/kg i.v.) and hydrochlorothiazide, at a  maximal effective dose (20 mg/kg i.v.), induced an additional diuretic and  saluretic effect.

We  quantitatively analyzed the influence of plasma potassium concentration on QT  intervals before drug administration and on drug-induced QT prolongation, to  estimate the risk of drug-induced arrhythmia under hypokalaemic conditions. The  hypokalaemic models were produced by intraperitoneal administration of furosemide  and hydrochlorothiazide in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The relationship between the  changes in QT intervals and time profiles of plasma quinidine (QND) concentration  were analyzed during constant intravenous infusion of QND (10 or 30 mg/kg/h) and  post infusion in normal and hypokalaemic rats. The plasma QND concentration  reached the therapeutic range (3-7 microg/ml) at the high infusion rate (30  mg/kg/h). No pharmacokinetic differences between normal and hypokalaemic rats  were observed. QND induced QT prolongation in parallel with the plasma  concentration without hysteresis. Although the potency of QND for QT prolongation  was not affected by hypokalaemia, the QT intervals before drug administration  were significantly prolonged in hypokalaemic rats (65.90 +/- 1.40 vs 56.60 +/-  0.748 msec, mean +/- SEM, p < 0.0001). Thus, the prolongation of QT intervals  before drug administration may act as a risk factor of arrhythmia under  hypokalaemic conditions.","1998","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:23:27","","2159-2169","","24","62","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 9627074","","","","Animals; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*chemically induced/metabolism/physiopathology; Electrocardiography; Heart Rate/drug effects; Heart/drug effects; Hypokalemia/*complications/metabolism/physiopathology; Infusions, Intravenous; Male; Myocardium/metabolism; Potassium/blood; Quinidine/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Risk Factors; Sodium/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It lengthens  repolarisation and the effective refractory period in all cardiac tissues  independently of its antiadrenergic properties. Combining Class II and Class III  antiarrhythmic properties, sotalol can be given either intravenously or orally  and its pharmacokinetic properties permit long dosing (once or twice daily)  intervals. Controlled and uncontrolled studies have established the efficacy of  sotalol in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and in angina of effort.  Sotalol reduces anginal frequency and glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin)  consumption and increases exercise capacity during treadmill stress tests. In  addition, although there is evidence that the drug reduces reinfarction rate in  survivors of acute infarction, the data for reduction in sudden death rates in  these patients are not as compelling as for other beta-blockers. However,  comparative and additional long term studies are required before an accurate  assessment of the use of sotalol in these disorders can be made. When used in the  treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension sotalol is more effective than placebo  and comparable to other beta-blockers in reducing elevated blood pressures. In  addition, a synergistic antihypertensive response is achieved when sotalol is  combined with hydrochlorothiazide. Still, additional well-controlled comparative  studies are required before the value of sotalol relative to other drug treatment  regimens in the management of hypertension can be made. In preliminary studies  sotalol appeared effective in most forms of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias  with its effects being similar to those of other beta-blockers. However,  preliminary data indicate that sotalol is likely to be more effective than than  conventional beta-blockers in converting atrial flutter and fibrillation to sinus  rhythm and maintaining stability post-conversion. Sotalol also appears to be a  promising agent in the control of ventricular arrhythmias. In suppressing  premature ventricular contractions it is at least as effective as procainamide.  In ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, intravenous sotalol (1.5 mg/kg),  prevents reinduction by programmed electrical stimulation in 40 to 50% of cases  if double stimuli are used. Both prevention of reinducible arrhythmia and the  suppression of spontaneous arrhythmias on Holter recordings are predictive of a  long term favourable clinical outcome. In patients with reduced ejection  fractions, sotalol depresses ventricular function less than conventional  beta-blockers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1987-09","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:42:32","","311-349","","3","34","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3315621","","","","*Sotalol/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Adult; Aged; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy; Clinical Trials as Topic; Female; Humans; Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. Molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have  led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors, such as aliskiren.  2. Aliskiren has a low bioavailability (between 2.6 and 5.0%) compensated by its  high potency to inhibit renin (IC50: 0.6 nmol/L) and a long plasma half-life  (23-36 h), which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing. 3. The once-daily  administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers BP as strongly as  standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers  (losartan, valsartan, irbesartan), hydrochlorothiazide, angiotensin converting  enzyme inhibitors (ramipril and lisinopril) or long acting calcium channel  blockers (amlodipine). In combination therapy, aliskiren further decreases blood  pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan or  ramipril. 4. The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those  of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and Ang II antagonism,  particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the  bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway and possibly the  (pro)renin receptor. 5. Blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) with ACE  inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers or a combination of these drugs has become one  of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. However, it remains  unclear how to optimize RAS blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal  benefits. In this context, renin inhibition to render the RAS fully quiescent is  a new possibility requiring further study.","2008-04","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:48:32","","426-430","","4","35","","Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 18307734","","","","Amides/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Therapy, Combination; Fumarates/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following oral dosing, peak concentrations of the active moiety, perindoprilat, are achieved after 2-3  hours and perindoprilat is barely detectable by 24 hours. In contrast, maximal  ACE inhibition is observed 4-6 hours after oral dosing and substantial inhibition  persists beyond 24 hours. Inhibition of ACE is dose-dependent over the range 1-16  mg perindopril orally, and is mirrored by elevation of plasma renin activity and  falls in aldosterone concentrations. Blood pressure reductions have been  confirmed in normotensive and hypertensive subjects with maximal effect 6-10  hours after dosing and adequate antihypertensive activity at 24 hours. Blood  pressure reductions are greater in the elderly than in young subjects due to  pharmacokinetic differences. Dose reduction is required in elderly subjects and  those with renal impairment.

It also inhibits the effects of serotonin on platelets in  cardiovascular disease, inhibits vasoconstriction caused by the amine, and when  administered intravenously improves some haemorheological indices in patients  with ischaemic diseases. The antihypertensive effect of oral ketanserin 40 mg  twice daily is comparable with that of total daily doses of metoprolol 200 mg,  propranolol 160 mg, captopril 100 mg, enalapril 20 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg,  or alpha-methyldopa 1000 mg and is achieved without adverse effect on plasma  lipoproteins or carbohydrate metabolism in patients with concomitant diabetes  mellitus. Evidence from prospective studies suggests a greater antihypertensive  efficacy in the elderly than in younger patients. In patients with intermittent  claudication, results have been inconsistent in small studies, while a large  study showed no improvement in pain-free walking distance but fewer amputations  compared to placebo. In Raynaud's phenomenon symptomatic improvement relative to  placebo was achieved in larger trials. Its role in preventing atherosclerotic  complications requires further investigation. Ketanserin is reasonably well  tolerated, the frequency of adverse effects being comparable with that of other  antihypertensive drugs in controlled trials. Dizziness, tiredness, oedema, dry  mouth and weight gain are the most commonly reported effects. Ketanserin prolongs  QT interval in a dose-related manner, and when given in certain predisposing  circumstances ventricular arrhythmias and syncope may occur. Administered  intravenously, ketanserin 10mg followed by an infusion of 2 to 4 mg/h controls  moderate to severe pre- and postoperative hypertension in most patients, acting  as a balanced vasodilator, lowering cardiac pre- and afterload. Although the  arrhythmogenic potential of ketanserin in patients receiving potassium-depleting  diuretics requires suitable precautions, it appears that its antihypertensive  activity is suited to the elderly provided plasma potassium concentrations are  normal at the start of treatment and are maintained within the normal range.","1990-12","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 13:29:53","","903-949","","6","40","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2079001","","","","Animals; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Ketanserin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Vascular Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neither the mechanism nor nephron site of  this antagonism has been determined. To identify sites and potential mechanisms,  cortical micropuncture was performed during hydrochlorothiazide treatment in  control and indomethacin rats. Indomethacin reduced (P less than 0.005) FeCl from  5.20 +/- 0.49% to 2.26 +/- 0.49% (mean +/- SE). MAP, CIn, and plasma volume were  not different between groups. SNGFR and fractional proximal fluid and chloride  delivery were not different between groups. Fractional chloride delivery to early  distal tubules was 10.8 +/- 0.4% in control but 6.2 +/- 0.3% in indomethacin rats  (P less than 0.001). Calculated loop chloride reabsorption was greater in  indomethacin than control rats during hydrochlorothiazide administration (41.0  +/- 1.6% vs. 34.3 +/- 2.3%; P less than 0.05). Fractional chloride delivery to  late distal tubules was 7.8 +/- 0.7% in control and 4.6 +/- 0.3% in indomethacin  rats (P less than 0.005), but distal tubule chloride reabsorption was not  different between groups. Papillary tissue chloride was less in control than  indomethacin rats during hydrochlorothiazide (P less than 0.05). Urinary PGE2  excretion was reduced (P less than 0.001) by indomethacin during  hydrochlorothiazide. Thus indomethacin induced reductions in hydrochlorothiazide  response result in part from increased chloride reabsorption in the loop segment.  This suggests indomethacin antagonizes hydrochlorothiazide by reducing chloride  delivery to hydrochlorothiazide's site of action in the distal tubule rather than  by effects of indomethacin on hydrochlorothiazide pharmacokinetics.","1987-05","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:26:04","","1097-1103","","5","31","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3599650","","","","Animals; Chlorides/urine; Diuresis/drug effects; Drug Interactions; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacology; Indomethacin/*pharmacology; Kidney Tubules, Distal/drug effects; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/drug effects; Male; Natriuresis/drug effects; Prostaglandins/urine; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A preliminary review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic efficacy.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-198529060-00002","","Piretanide is a potent 'loop' diuretic whose principal site of action is in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. When administered orally or  intravenously to healthy volunteers it rapidly increases diuresis and electrolyte  excretion, and the effects are short-lived. In comparative studies, piretanide  has generally been found to be 5 to 7 times more potent than frusemide  (furosemide) but only one-tenth as potent as bumetanide, on a weight-for-weight  basis. Piretanide 6 to 12 mg/day, in conventional or sustained release  formulations, has been shown to significantly lower elevated blood pressure in a  large proportion of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Comparative  trials of up to 3 months duration indicate that at this dosage piretanide is of  comparable antihypertensive efficacy as hydrochlorothiazide 50 to 100 mg/day, but  has significantly less effect on serum potassium levels. Short term studies in  patients with oedema caused by renal, hepatic or cardiac failure demonstrated  that piretanide 6 to 9 mg is of similar diuretic potency as frusemide 40 mg and  bumetanide 1 mg. In medium term trials in patients with congestive heart failure  piretanide 6 mg/day produced equivalent symptomatic improvement as frusemide 40  mg/day. When used to treat oedema caused by liver disease, piretanide 12 to 24  mg/day was successful in only about 50% of patients, but spironolactone added to  the treatment regimen greatly increased the response rate. Generally, piretanide  has been well-tolerated in clinical trials, although the conventional tablet  formulation has caused a relatively high incidence of acute adverse  effects--these were greatly reduced with the introduction of the sustained  release formulation. Serum concentrations of most electrolytes have not shown any  consistent adverse trends and hyperuricaemia and hypokalaemia have been  encountered infrequently. Thus, piretanide appears to offer an effective  alternative to other 'loop' diuretics for the treatment of oedematous diseases  and to hydrochlorothiazide for the management of mild to moderate hypertension.  However, its relative place in therapy remains to be clarified with wider  clinical experience.","1985-06","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 13:33:16","","489-530","","6","29","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3891305","","","","Angina Pectoris/drug therapy; Animals; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Diuretics/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Dogs; Edema/drug therapy; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Kidney Diseases/drug therapy; Kidney/drug effects; Kinetics; Lipid Metabolism; Liver Diseases/complications; Metabolism/drug effects; Rabbits; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Sulfonamides/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the combination of the product components in the new  FDC capsule formulation affects their respective pharmacokinetic and in vitro  dissolution patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro dissolution profiles were  compared in USP-43 and in biorelevant dissolution media. In vivo comparisons were  obtained in a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-way  crossover study in 24 healthy subjects. During each treatment period, subjects  received the test formulation (FDC hard capsule containing CC/HCTZ/RSV) or the  reference formulation (co-administration of a FDC CC/HCTZ tablet and a RSV  tablet). Plasma samples were collected periodically over 48 hours post-dose.  Safety and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Dissolution profiles of all  active drugs in the Test (capsule) and Reference Products (as tablets) were  within the tolerance dissolution criteria of USP-43 conditions. HCTZ dissolution  profiles were closely similar whereas those for RSV and CC did not match at  specific pHs. In the pharmacokinetic study, the 90% confidence intervals (CIs)  for the geometric least-square mean ratios of C(max), AUC(0-last), and AUC(0-inf)  were 0.95 - 1.18, 0.95 - 1.15 and 0.95 - 1.13 (CC); 0.91 - 1.10, 0.96 - 1.08, and  0.96 - 1.09 (HCTZ) and 0.82 - 1.23, 0.81 - 1.13, and 0.82 - 1.12 (RSV),  respectively.

Of all  diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and chlorthalidone (CTD) are the most  commonly used, with HCTZ being the most widely prescribed diuretic. Recent  studies have shown that CTD is a better diuretic with superior antihypertensive  effectiveness and cardiovascular protection. Although these diuretics are  chemically, pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically different, CTD continues  to be called a ""thiazide-like"" diuretic. The only common features they both share  are a sulfhydryl group in their molecules and their common mechanism and site of  diuretic action. In order to get a better understanding of the true pharmacologic  actions as well as the benefits and risks of these diuretics, a MEDLINE search of  the English language literature between 1964 and January 2021 was conducted,  using the terms ""diuretics"", ""hydrochlorothiazide"", ""chlorthalidone"",  ""hypertension"", ""cardiovascular disease"" and ""treatment"". From this search, 28  pertinent papers were selected and they will be discussed in this review together  with collateral literature.

It is likely that future hypertension  guidelines will recommend lowering BP beyond the currently recommended  systolic/diastolic BP goals of lower than 140/90 mmHg for all patients with  hypertension and lower than 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes or chronic  kidney disease. In a series of clinical trials, the combination of olmesartan  medoxomil, a well-established angiotensin receptor blocker, and  hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, has produced greater reductions in  systolic BP and diastolic BP and greater proportions of patients achieving BP  goals than monotherapy with either component. Additionally, the increased  efficacy resulting from the combination with hydrochlorothiazide does not appear  to significantly affect the tolerability profile of olmesartan medoxomil.

G.","Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide association in the treatment of hypertension.","Current vascular pharmacology","","1570-1611","10.2174/157016109787455644","","Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important and common vascular risk factors but it is often poorly controlled. Inhibition of the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) provides beneficial effects in  hypertensives. The association of low-dosed diuretics in combination with RAAS  blocking agents allows maximum benefit from potassium depletion and control of  compensatory increase in renin secretion, so increasing the efficacy and safety  of RAAS blockers. Irbesartan is a potent and selective angiotensin II subtype 1  receptor antagonist indicated for use in patients with hypertension, including  those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. Once-daily irbesartan  administration provides 24h control of BP. In patients with mild-to-moderate  hypertension, irbesartan was as effective as enalapril, atenolol and amlodipine,  and more effective than losartan and valsartan in terms of absolute reduction in  BP and response rate. Irbesartan also induced regression of left ventricular  hypertrophy. Moreover, irbesartan 300 mg/day exerts a significant renoprotective  effect in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. The relative risk of doubling of  serum creatinine was significantly lower with irbesartan than amlodipine or  placebo. Irbesartan was also effective in non-diabetic nephropatic patients.  Moreover, irbesartan has peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonistic  effects in in vitro studies, and it also demonstrated beneficial effects on  inflammatory markers of atherosclerosis and endothelial function. The overall  incidence of adverse events is similar to that of placebo. A fixed dose of  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and irbesartan shows additive antihypertensive effect  in a dose dependent manner up to HCTZ 25 mg and irbesartan 300 mg with high  tolerability in diverse patient groups. Combination effects on end organ  protection must be evaluated by broad spectrum studies. Ongoing trials about  irbesartan and its combination with diuretics may provide necessary data to  interpret the value of this association among others.","2009-04","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:34:11","","120-136","","2","7","","Curr Vasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 19355995","","","","Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects; Hypertension/drug therapy/physiopathology; Irbesartan; Tetrazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a class IV drug according to the Biopharmaceutical  Classification System, that is, it presents low solubility and low permeability  and, consequently, low absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. As a strategy to  improve stability and biopharmaceutical properties of hydrochlorothiazide, the  use of cyclodextrins to produce inclusion complexes, applying different methods,  was investigated. In the phase solubility studies, β-cyclodextrin was identified  as the cyclodextrin which provided the most promising results in terms of the  solubilization of the drug. The thermal analysis verified the interaction between  hydrochlorothiazide and β-cyclodextrin, indicating the formation of inclusion  complexes, and the thermal stability varied according to the preparation  technique. The physicochemical characterization showed that in the inclusion  complexes obtained by co-evaporation, kneading followed by freeze-drying and  kneading followed by spray-drying the hydrochlorothiazide complexation mostly  occurred with different degrees of amorphization and the drug solubility was  improved. These three inclusion complexes presented better in vitro  characteristics and the inclusion complex obtained by kneading followed by  freeze-drying increased the in vivo diuretic activity of the drug accompanied by  significant effects on natriuresis, kaliuresis and chloriuresis. The inclusion  complex formation was effective in improving the biopharmaceutical properties of  hydrochlorothiazide and protecting the drug from hydrolysis. This paper describes  an important alternative approach to the development of liquid pharmaceutical  formulations to pediatric administration, a real need of the current  pharmaceutical market.","2016-02-15","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:31:32","","71-78","","","83","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Bendroflumethiazide and bumetanide are completely absorbed from the gut while the  uptake of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and furosemide averages about 65%.  The degree of uptake of amiloride and spironolactone is unknown but exceeds 50%.  Plasma t 1/2 of bumetanide and furosemide are approximately 1 h. The clinically  important phase of the plasma concentration of bendroflumethiazide has a t 1/2 of  3 h, although a slower phase with a t 1/2 of 9 h has been described.  Hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride, often used in combination, both have a t 1/2  of about 10 h. Canrenone, an active metabolite of spironolactone, has a t 1/2 of  15-20 h. Chlorthalidone is eliminated very slowly with a t 1/2 of about two days.  This is partly caused by an extensive binding to carbonic anhydrase in the  erythrocytes. The protein binding of bendroflumethiazide, bumetanide, canrenone  and furosemide is approximately 95%. The binding of chlorthalidone and  hydrochlorothiazide is about 75 and 40% respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After a single-blind,  4-week, placebo run-in phase, 527 patients (mean +/- SD age 54.5 +/- 1.2 years)  with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 101.2-101.7 mmHg were randomly assigned  to one of the three treatments for 8 weeks. The main evaluation criteria were  diastolic blood pressure and serum potassium concentration. Equivalence was  assessed on an intention-to-treat basis, using Schuirmann's method, which  involves performing two one-tailed statistical tests on the data. Thirty-five  patients were withdrawn from the study but there were no differences between  groups in the reasons for withdrawal. RESULTS: Diastolic blood pressure decreased  by between 13.1 and 14.2 mmHg in the three groups. The 90% confidence intervals  for the differences between perindopril + indapamide and the other treatments  were -1.1, +1.7 mmHg for captopril + hydrochlorothiazide and -0.4, +2.6 mmHg for  enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide. Schuirmann's test was highly statistically  significant (P<0.001 for perindopril + indapamide versus captopril +  hydrochlorothiazide; P<0.002 for perindopril + indapamide versus enalapril +  hydrochlorothiazide), so that the two one-sided hypotheses that the treatments  were not equivalent were rejected at the nominal level of alpha = 0.05.  Similarly, the safety of the treatments was equivalent in terms of serum  potassium. The 90% confidence intervals of the differences between perindopril +  indapamide and the other treatments were -8.7, -1.6% for captopril +  hydrochlorothiazide (P = 0.004) and -1.5, +2.7% for enalapril +  hydrochlorothiazide (P<0.001).

Model evaluation is an important issue in population analyses. Our aim was to perform and illustrate metrics and techniques for internal and external  evaluation with an application to population pharmacokinetics of  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).2. A nonlinear mixed effects model was used to study  the pharmacokinetics of HCTZ. In addition, different types of internal assessment  tools and external metrics were used for model evaluation. External evaluation  was performed using an alternative dataset that included data from an independent  group of subjects. For comparison, a previously published population  pharmacokinetic model for HCTZ was applied to the same data.3. A two-compartment  model with first-order oral absorption using a constant time delay between  administration and absorption and first-order elimination best described HCTZ  pharmacokinetics.

The final model showed better predictive performance than the other  previously published HCTZ model.4. Finally, a robust population pharmacokinetic  model for HCTZ in adults was constructed and validated internally and externally.

The drug-dendrimer complexes were prepared by  phase-equilibration method. The results showed that the solubility of RAPL and  HCTZ was dependent on dendrimer concentration and pH of dendrimer solution. The  solubility profile of both RAPL and HCTZ dendrimer complexes illustrated a  non-linear relationship with dendrimer concentration. At 0.8% (w/v) dendrimer  concentration, solubility of RAPL was increased 4.91 folds with amine-terminated  while for HCTZ, solubility enhancement was highest (3.72 folds) with  carboxy-terminated. The complexes were characterized by Fourier transform  infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and high performance  liquid chromatography. In-vitro drug dissolution performance of pure drugs,  individual drug loaded dendrimer formulations and hybrid formulations was studied  in USP dissolution medium (pH7.0) and in simulated gastric fluid (pH1.2).  Dendrimer mediated formulations showed faster and complete dissolution compared  to pure RAPL or HCTZ. Surprisingly, similar pattern of dissolution profile was  established with hybrid formulations as compared to individual drug loaded  dendrimers. The dendrimer-based hybrid formulations were found to be stable at  dark and refrigerated conditions up to 5weeks. Conclusively, the proposed  formulation strategy establishes a novel multitasking platform using dendrimer  for simultaneous loading and delivery of multiple drugs for pharmaceutical  applications.","2017-01-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:42:35","","84-92","","","96","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filaments were used as the exci-pient to prepare  the shell of tablet. The ellipse-shaped tablets (the length of major axes of  ellipse was 20 mm, the length of the minor axes of ellipse was 10 mm, the height  of tablet was 5 mm) with two separate compartments were designed and printed  using FDM 3D printer. The height of layer was 0.2 mm, and the thickness of roof  or floor was 0.6 mm. The thickness of shell was 1.2 mm, and the thickness of the  partition wall between the two compartments was 0.6 mm. Two cardiovascular drugs,  captopril (CTP) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), were selected as model drugs for  the printed compound tablet and filled in the two compartments of the tablet,  respectively. The microscopic morphology of the tablets was observed by scanning  electron microscopy (SEM). The weight variation of the tablets was investigated  by electronic scale. The hardness of the tablets was measured by a single-column  mechanical test system. The contents of the drugs in the tablets were determined  by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the dissolution apparatus  was used to measure the in vitro drug release of the tablets.

ARBs have been shown to improve cardiovascular  morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with heart failure or diabetic  nephropathy. For this later class of patients, the American Diabetes Association  recommends ARBs as the primary treatment option. The ARBs function by blocking  the binding of angiotensin-II (A-II) to its receptor, thereby inhibiting the  action of A-II. Unlike the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which  block the production of A-II through the ACE pathway, the ARBs effectively  inhibit A-II regardless of whether it is produced through ACE or some alternate  enzyme pathway. This difference in action offers a distinct advantage of ARBs  over ACE inhibitors. Olmesartan medoxomil, the latest addition to the ARB class,  is a long-acting, safe and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug. The combination  of olmesartan medoxomil with a low-dose diuretic, potentiates the blood pressure  lowering effect of either agent alone and is highly effective in achieving the  recommended blood pressure goals in the majority of patients treated.","2004-03","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:30:59","","657-667","","3","5","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15013933","","","","Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Diuretics; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Imidazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Olmesartan Medoxomil; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Tetrazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The presence of multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and  pharmacodynamics, as well as skin changes in the elderly contribute to a unique  diagnostic and management problem. This article reviews the epidemiology of  cutaneous adverse drug reactions in the elderly and elaborates on a few specific  types of reactions which are more relevant to the elderly. RECENT FINDINGS:  Chronic dermatoses, for example, eczema, have been reported to be associated with  the use of long-term medications such as calcium channel blockers and  hydrochlorothiazide. Elderly patients receiving treatment for cancers may develop  chemotherapy-related cutaneous side effects, including those associated with  newer 'targeted' molecular therapies. Elderly patients who develop severe  cutaneous adverse drug reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic  epidermal necrolysis, have worse prognosis in terms of mortality. SUMMARY:  Persons of advanced age often have multiple comorbidities and are on multiple  medications. This can result in higher probability of an elderly person  developing drug eruptions. It is important for the clinician to be aware of the  range of drug-related eruptions and their implications.","2015-08","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:23:18","","300-307","","4","15","","Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26110679","","","","*Aging; *Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/diagnosis/mortality/pathology; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Calcium Channel Blockers/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology; Prognosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment guidelines and  compendia often consider these 2 drugs interchangeable agents within the class of  thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. Many sources list them as equipotent.  Despite these beliefs, there is some suggestion that cardiovascular outcomes are  not necessarily the same with these 2 drugs.

Fractional 47Ca intestinal absorption (FCaA) and fractional urinary  calcium excretion (FCaEx) were measured in six normal individuals and in ten  patients receiving glucocorticoids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  before and after 60 days of treatment with a 50 mEq sodium diet and HCT 50 mg  twice daily. FCaA was significantly decreased on glucocorticoid-treated patients  (27.5 +/- 4.3%) when compared to normal individuals (41.8 +/- 2.8%, p less than  0.005). A significant increase in FCaA to 38.9 +/- 4.8%, (P less than .05) was  seen in glucocorticoid-treated patients after treatment with HCT and dietary  sodium restriction. Baseline FCaEx was higher in glucocorticoid-treated patients  than in the normal subjects. A significant decrease in FCaEx after dietary sodium  restriction and thiazide administration occurred in both normal (0.99 +/- 0.28%  before vs. 0.69 +/- 0.30% after; p less than .025) and glucocorticoid-treated  patients (1.46 +/- 0.19% before vs. 0.73 +/- 0.13% after p; less than 0.025).

Various factors have impact on loss of  therapy response. Drug-drug-interactions (DDIs) may cause altered  pharmacokinetics (PK) of antihypertensive drugs. Upregulation of activity and  expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes can result in decreased plasma drug  levels. Besides these PK considerations a significant problem could be  nonadherence to drug therapy. In this regard Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is  a useful tool for detecting nonadherence. Therefore a LC-MS/MS-method for  determination of Metoprolol (MET), Amlodipine (AML), Canrenone (CAN) and  Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) was developed. METHODS: An UHPLC-MS/MS method was  developed and validated for simultaneous determination of MET, AML, CAN and HCT  in plasma matrix. Extraction of serum samples consisted of simple protein  precipitation using acetonitrile. Stable isotope labeled analogues for each  antihypertensive were obtained for internal standardization and quantitative  analysis ([(2)H(7)]-MET, ([(13)C(6)]-AML, [(2)H(4)]-CAN, [(13)C(6)]-HCT).  Calibrators and quality controls were prepared in plasma matrix of normal  individuals. Sample preparation: protein precipitation with acetonitrile and  addition of internal standard-mix. RESULTS: All analytes were eluted within a  runtime of 2.5 min. Linearity experiments were demonstrated in plasma over  following concentration ranges: MET: 5-750 μg/l, AML: 1-50 μg/l, CAN:  10-500 μg/l, HCT: 5-500 μg/l (R(2) > 0.993). Chromatographic separation was  achieved using a C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm particle size) and an isocratic  elution. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a triple quadrupole mass  spectrometer using positive and negative electrospray ionization in selected  reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Ion transitions monitored for quantitation were  m/z 268.2 → 74.1 for MET, m/z 409.1 → 238.0 for AML, m/z 341.2 → 91.0 for CAN and  m/z 296.0 → 205.1 for HCT. For all analytes, inter- and intra-day precision (CV,  %) varied between 1.7 and 14.0 and inter- and intra-day accuracy values ranged  from -2.5 to 7.1%. The lower limits of detection and quantification were: 0.08  and 0.23; 0.05 and 0.15; 2.82 and 8.54; and 0.02 and 0.05 μg/l for MET, AML, CAN  and HCT, respectively. Results of stability experiments were within the required  range of +/- 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the level of recommendation of TDM of  antihypertensive drugs in patients with refractory hypertension is not yet  established, the present LC-MS/MS-method can serve as an effective tool for  detection of PK-alterations/nonadherence and may help to monitor antihypertensive  pharmacotherapy.","2019-02-05","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:24:59","","373-381","","","164","","J Pharm Biomed Anal","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A triglyceride-rich emulsion  resembling lymph chylomicrons, labeled with (3H) triolein and (14C) cholesteryl  oleate, was infused intravenously into mildly hypertensive patients after 8 weeks  on placebo and subsequently on hydrochlorothiazide (n = 10) or propranolol (n =  8). The residence time of both radioactivities in plasma was utilized for the  simultaneous calculation of the particle remnant removal rate and of the  lipoprotein lipase activity expressed as a delipidation index = 1 - [(3H)  triolein residence time/(14C) cholesteryl oleate residence time]. Treatment with  hydrochlorothiazide diminished the delipidation rate value whereas propranolol  mildly increased the removal rate of the remnant particle. These alterations of  the chylomicron kinetics were not accompanied by changes in plasma triglycerides,  glucose, and insulin concentration as measured in the fasting state. The  impairment of the lipoprotein lipase activity by thiazides and the faster removal  rate of the whole particle by propranolol could explain the reason why in  previous clinical studies the simultaneous use of these drugs does not aggravate  the hyperlipidemia known to be induced by thiazides alone.","2005-07","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:28:59","","617-623","","7","83","","Can J Physiol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 16091787","","","","Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use; Cholesterol Esters/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Chylomicrons/*metabolism; Female; Hemodynamics/drug effects/physiology; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology; Lipids/blood; Lipoproteins, VLDL/blood; Male; Middle Aged; Propranolol/*therapeutic use; Triolein/metabolism/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their fluid nature limited the stability of the  loaded drug and hindered the development of stable oral dosage form. Accordingly,  the objective was to develop solid self dispersing mixed micelle forming systems  (MMFS) for enhanced dissolution and intestinal permeability of  hydrochlorothiazide. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed using sodium  cholate, lecithin with either poloxamer 407 or PEG 4000 to determine the  composition of MMFS. Both polymer free and poloxamer or PEG containing MMFS were  prepared as homogenous matrices or as solid self dispersing powder. The later was  developed by adsorption of MMFS on avicel-aerosil mixture. Differential scanning  calorimetry provided an evidence for existence of hydrochlorothiazide as  molecular dispersion in the MMFS. Dispersing polymer free, PEG 4000 or poloxamer  based MMFS in aqueous medium produced micelles having size values of 119, 52.6  and 28nm, respectively. The zeta potential values were -61.8, -59.5 and -19.5mV  for the same systems, respectively. Preparation of solid self dispersing MMFS  enhanced the dissolution rate of hydrochlorothiazide. The intestinal absorption  of hydrochlorothiazide from its aqueous solution and polymer incorporating mixed  micellar systems was monitored using in situ rabbit intestinal perfusion  technique. The permeability results showed a clear trend for enhanced membrane  transport of the drug after being incorporated into poloxamer containing mixed  micellar system. The study thus introduced a versatile easily formulated solid  self dispersing system with high potential for solving the dissolution and  permeability problems of class IV drugs.","2017-01-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:43:12","","206-216","","","149","","Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Method (A) depends on determining OL and HZ by measuring  the second derivative of the ratio spectra ((2)DD) at 254.4 and 338.6 nm,  respectively. Method (B) is first derivative of the double divisor ratio spectra  (D-(1)DD) at 260.4 and 273.0 nm for OL and HZ, respectively. Method (C) based on  successive spectrophotometric resolution technique (SSRT). The technique starts  with the ratio subtraction method then measuring OL and HZ at their isoabsorptive  point at 260.0 nm, while HZ is measured using the amplitude of first derivative  at 335.2 nm. Method (D) is mean centering of the ratio spectra (MCR) at 252.0 nm  and 220.0 nm for OL and HZ, respectively. The specificity of the developed  methods is investigated by analyzing laboratory prepared mixtures containing  different ratios of the three drugs and their combined dosage form.

For this aim 669  hypertensive patients have been randomized in a double blind, parallel study to  the monotherapy or to the association. The follow-up was of 12 weeks, after a  run-in wash-out period of 3-4 weeks. Seated blood pressure and heart rate were  measured in all 4 outpatients visit and blood was withdrawn for serum  electrolytes, glycemia, serum creatinine, uric acid and lipoprotein profile. 338  patients were randomized to the association and 331 to monotherapy with a slight  prevalence of women. Mean age (58 +/- 9 and 56 +/- 10 years), pretreatment seated  blood pressure (165 +/- 14/102 +/- 5 and 166 +/- 15/105 +/- 5 mmHg) and heart  rate (77 +/- 9 heart/min in both group) were similar in the two groups. Seated  blood pressure was significantly reduced in both groups (-22.8/-16.8 mmHg in the  association group and -18.8/-13.4 mmHg in the monotherapy group), however the  blood pressure reduction in patients treated with the association was slightly,  but significantly, greater. Lipid profile, blood glucose, serum potassium and  creatinine and uric acid were slightly worsened in the monotherapy group, while  there were no changes or a mild improvement in patients treated with the  combination of diuretic and the ACE-inhibitor. In conclusion the association  lisinopril 20 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/die causes a blood pressure  reduction slightly, but significantly, greater than with a higher dose of the  diuretic monotherapy, without any negative interference on lipid profile, blood  glucose and serum potassium.","1995-09","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:28:55","","389-398","","9","43","","Minerva Cardioangiol","","","","","","","","ita","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 8552268","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug Tolerance; Female; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/*drug therapy/metabolism; Lisinopril/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Male; Middle Aged","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrochlorothiazide is a commonly used  thiazide diuretic; whereas chlorthalidone is a structurally similar compound,  quite dissimilar pharmacokinetically with a much longer half-life for effect and  a wider volume of distribution with heavy partitioning in red blood cells. These  pharmacokinetic features afford chlorthalidone a unique advantage in its capacity  to act as an effective diuretic and blood-pressure-lowering agent, as well as a  compound that improves cardiovascular outcomes in the patient with hypertension.  Chlorthalidone has been used sparingly in clinical practice in large measure  because it is not readily available in many fixed-dose combination products.  Fixed-dose combinations containing chlorthalidone and an angiotensin-receptor  blocker are now in development.

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic use in hypertension.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-198836040-00002","","Felodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist which selectively relaxes vascular smooth muscle. By acting at peripheral arterioles, it lowers systemic  vascular resistance and thereby produces substantial decreases in blood pressure  and increases in cardiac output. Felodipine is indicated for the management of  hypertension, and in patients with mild to moderate disease felodipine  monotherapy markedly lowers blood pressure. It proved as effective as atenolol,  and equivalent to hydrochlorothiazide, either with or without amiloride, in terms  of antihypertensive activity. Comparative studies also demonstrated that once  daily administration with an extended-release formulation provides equivalent  antihypertensive efficacy to the same amount of drug administered twice daily as  the standard tablets. As a second- or third-line treatment for patients with  moderate to severe hypertension refractory to standard drug combinations,  felodipine produced considerable reductions in blood pressure when added to  beta-blockers and diuretics, either alone or in combination, in studies lasting  up to 48 weeks. In comparative studies of multiple-drug treatments felodipine was  found to have superior efficacy to hydralazine and prazosin, and was at least as  effective as nifedipine, minoxidil and propranolol, when used with diuretics  and/or beta-blockers. As an alternative to hydrochlorothiazide, in combination  with beta-blockers, felodipine consistently controlled blood pressure in a  greater percentage of patients and usually provided greater decreases in blood  pressure. The main side effects with felodipine are ankle oedema, headache and  flushing. Although the overall incidence of effects is quite high, they are  usually mild in nature. Nevertheless, withdrawal due to side effects has been  necessary in about 7% of patients overall. Thus, the efficacy of felodipine has  been demonstrated in mild, moderate and severe hypertension. At the present time  it seems particularly suitable as a second- or third-line treatment in refractory  hypertension, but it also can be used as monotherapy for mild to moderate  disease.","1988-10","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:36:38","","387-428","","4","36","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3069435","","","","Felodipine; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Nitrendipine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated  the effects of omapatrilat in comparison with an angiotensin I-receptor  antagonist/diuretic combination on blood pressure, endothelial function and  cardiac hypertrophy in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP).  METHODS: Male and female SHRSP were treated orally with omapatrilat or irbesartan  plus hydrochlorothiazide (I + H) or vehicle for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure  was measured weekly by tail-cuff. Cardiac hypertrophy was monitored by  echocardiography at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Endothelial function [basal nitric  oxide (NO) bioavailability and stimulated NO release] was examined in carotid  arteries using organ bath pharmacology and in mesenteric resistance arteries  using wire myography. RESULTS: Compared with untreated controls, omapatrilat and  I + H significantly attenuated hypertension [male control, 198.3 +/- 6.9 mmHg  versus omapatrilat, 149.6 +/- 3.8 mmHg (F = 8.63 P < 0.0001), versus I + H, 145.6  +/- 5.1 mmHg (F = 7.38 P < 0.0001); female control, 170.3 +/-8.3 mmHg versus  omapatrilat, 120.0 +/- 4.6 mmHg (F = 8.36, P < 0.0001), versus I + H, 112.2 +/-  2.9 mmHg (F = 9.08, P < 0.0001)] and left ventricular hypertrophy [male + female  controls, 3.02 +/- 0.38 mg/g versus omapatrilat, 2.47 +/- 0.26 mg/g (P < 0.0001;  95% confidence interval, 0.27, 0.83), versus I + H, 2.49 +/- 0.21 mg/g (P <  0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.25, 0.83)]. Both treatments also significantly  increased male carotid artery basal NO bioavailability relative to control  [control, 0.62 +/- 0.17 g/g versus omapatrilat, 1.95 +/- 0.17 g/g (P < 0.0001;  95% confidence interval, -1.83, -0.36), versus I + H, 1.57 +/- 0.21 g/g (P <  0.026; 95% confidence interval, -1.31, -0.12)].

CONCLUSIONS: Omapatrilat treatment significantly reduced left  ventricular hypertrophy and improved endothelial function in carotid arteries  from male SHRSP by NO-dependent mechanisms.

To ensure interchangeability between a brand-name and generic or  similar drugs is necessary that they are bioequivalent. With the growing number  of generic drugs, it is common for patients to replace a generic to another or  one similar. However, this exchange can not guarantee the maintenance of  bioequivalence. To evaluate the safety interchangeability between different  generic and similar drugs with Hydrochlorothiazide and Enalapril Maleate, a  meta-analysis was carried out with several bioequivalence studies with these  drugs. METHODS: Data from bioequivalence of generic and similar drugs approved by  the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) (drug regulatory agency in  Brazil) were used. The compatibility of data from each study was analyzed and the  determination of a confidence interval for the differences between the means of  pharmacokinetic parameters, area under the curve (ASC0-t) and maximum plasma  concentration (Cmax), was made for each study by meta-analysis. RESULTS: The  interchangeability between the combinations of the three products with  Hydrochlorothiazide was confirmed based on the obtained confidence intervals. For  the drugs studied with Enalapril Maleate interchangeability has not been  confirmed for 50% of the product comparisons. CONCLUSION: The exchange was  established between the three products with hydrochlorothiazide. However, for the  Enalapril Maleate half of the products studied are not interchangeable,  considering they do not match the established intervals for bioequivalence tests,  so the pharmacokinetics behavior and thus the effectiveness of the product may be  changed.","2010-06","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:29:23","","173-181","","2","32","","J Bras Nefrol","","","","","","","","por","","","","","","","Place: Brazil PMID: 21103677","","","","*Drug Substitution; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/*pharmacokinetics; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacokinetics; Therapeutic Equivalency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulatory  agencies emphasize Quality by Design based approach for product development to  entrust quality in the product. OBJECTIVE: The current research aimed to develop  a quality product profile of HCTZ modifiedrelease tablets (MRT; ~14 h) by  applying Response Surface Methodology using the computational QbD approach.  METHODS: Three independent factors were identified by qualitative and  quantitative risk assessment. Statistical terms like p-value, lack of fit, the  sum of square, R-squared value, model F value, and linear equations were  determined. Graphical tools like normal plot of residual, residual vs predicted  plot and box cox plot were used to verify the model selection. The graphical  relationship among the critical, independent variables was represented using the  Contour plot and 3-D surface plot. Design space was identified by designing an  overlay plot using response surface design. RESULTS: Excellent correlation was  observed between actual and predicted values. Similarity Factor (F2) of  reproducible trials was 78 and 79, and content uniformity was 100.9% and 100.4%.  Average weight, hardness, thickness, diameter, and friability were within  acceptable limits.

Clinical pharmacokinetic and therapeutic implications.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199121060-00004","","Drug absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the impact of GI surgery and disease on drug absorption are discussed. Recommendations are made to manage  problems of drug malabsorption. Absorption from the GI tract is a first-order  process described by its rate and extent. GI surgery changes the anatomy of the  GI tract and alters important variables in the absorption process. In the wake of  procedures which diminish small bowel surface area, the extent of absorption of  phenytoin, digoxin, cyclosporin, aciclovir, hydrochlorothiazide and certain oral  contraceptives is reported to be reduced. The underlying cause of the reduction  is unknown. When gastric emptying time or pH are altered by surgery, the rate of  drug absorption appears to be reduced. However, it is not clear which variable is  more important in determining therapeutic effects. The effects of coeliac and  inflammatory bowel diseases on the distribution and clearance of drugs must be  considered before attributing abnormal serum concentrations of drugs to  malabsorption. GI disease may slow gastric emptying and delay the complete  absorption of drugs when their rate of absorption depends on gastric emptying  time. Other inflammatory GI diseases such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of  the gut, Behçet's syndrome and scleroderma involving the GI tract may directly  reduce absorption of drugs such as cyclosporin, amitriptyline, benzodiazepines,  anticonvulsants, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and penicillamine. GI diseases which  alter gut pH affect the absorption only of drugs with limited water solubility  and pH-dependent dissolution such as ketoconazole. Clinicians should be aware of  the variable absorption seen after GI disease and surgery and monitor their  patients accordingly.","1991-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:22:15","","431-447","","6","21","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 1782738","","","","*Pharmacokinetics; Gastrointestinal Diseases/*metabolism/surgery; Humans; Intestinal Absorption/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significant ATP-dependent uptake of  hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and furosemide was observed in membrane vesicles that  expressed multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) and breast cancer  resistance protein (BCRP). Unlike taurocholate uptake, S-methylglutathione had no  effect on the ATP-dependent uptake of both compounds by MRP4. The functional  importance of MRP4 and BCRP in the urinary excretion of HCT and furosemide was  investigated using gene knockout mice. The renal clearance of HCT and furosemide  was reduced significantly but not abolished in Mrp4 knockout mice compared with  wild-type mice (9.0 +/- 0.9 versus 15 +/- 2 ml/min per kg for HCT and 1.9 +/- 0.3  versus 2.7 +/- 0.1 ml/min per kg for furosemide), and the amount of HCT that was  associated with the kidney specimens was greater in Mrp4 knockout mice (21 +/- 3  versus 13 +/- 1 nmol/g kidney). In contrast, Bcrp makes only a negligible  contribution because the urinary excretion was unchanged in Bcrp knockout mice.  Our results suggest that Mrp4, together with other unknown transporters, accounts  for the luminal efflux of HCT and furosemide from proximal tubular epithelial  cells.","2007-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:22:37","","37-45","","1","18","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17135398","","","","Animals; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism; Diuretics/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/urine; Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism; Female; Furosemide/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*urine; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*urine; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/drug effects/metabolism; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Models, Biological; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The determination was carried out on a Waters Quattro-micro  triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in multiple reaction monitoring  (MRM) mode using the following transitions monitored simultaneously: positive m/z  230-->171 for amiloride, m/z 270-->158 for rizatriptan, and negative m/z  296-->205 for hydrochlorothiazide. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs)  were 0.1 and 1.0 ng.mL(-1) for amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively,  which were lower than other published methods by using ultraviolet (UV),  fluorimetric or mass spectrometric detection. The intra- and inter-day precision  and accuracy were studied at three different concentration levels and were always  better than 15% (n=5).

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE  (1948-January 2011) and EMBASE (1974-January 2011) using the terms polypill and  Polycap. When limited to clinical trials, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses, 7  studies were identified. Bibliographies of pertinent review articles and studies  were scanned for additional references. A similar search was conducted to  identify literature related to the use of polypill components for primary  prevention of CVD and stroke. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies that  evaluated the hypothetical benefits of a polypill and controlled trials that  assessed a formulation of the polypill related to prevention of CVD and stroke  were included. Studies were assessed for efficacy, safety, drug interactions, and  clinical pharmacokinetics. DATA SYNTHESIS: An initial study to predict benefit  estimated that a hypothetical polypill would reduce diastolic blood pressure by  11 mm Hg and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 70 mg/dL, thus  reducing the relative risks of CVD and stroke by 88% and 80%, respectively. One  clinical trial in patients at low risk for CVD and stroke found that diastolic  blood pressure was reduced by 1.6 mm Hg and LDL-C was reduced by 17.7 mg/dL,  correlating with 44% and 21% reduction in the relative risks of CVD and stroke,  respectively. Studies in higher risk patients reported reductions in systolic  blood pressure of up to 28.8 mm Hg and in LDL-C of up to 54 mg/dL, correlating  with 62% and 60% relative reduction in risks of CVD and stroke, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Polypill study results have been more modest than originally  theorized.

The assessment of the process  of printing must take into consideration the precision and the accuracy of the  mass and dose of tablets, together with their solid-state properties and drug  dissolution behaviour. Different mixtures made of either poly(vinyl alcohol) and  paracetamol or hydroxypropylcellulose EF and hydrochlorothiazide were used to  evaluate multiple printing of tablets by manufacturing batches of 30 tablets with  nozzles of 0.4 and 0.7 mm, in two different printers. Besides testing for mass,  drug content, density and dissolution performance, tablets were analysed for  their thermal (DSC) and spectroscopic (NIR and FTIR) properties. Low standard  deviations around mean values for the different properties measured suggested low  intra-batch variability. Statistical analysis of data revealed no significant  differences between the batches for most of the properties considered in the  study. Inter-batch differences (p<0.05) were observed only for mass of tablets,  possibly due to deviation on filament's diameter. The use of a smaller nozzle or  a different printer enabled the manufacture of more reproducible tablets within a  batch.

The importance of ISR can be  envisaged from its role in clinical as well as non-clinical studies. Incurred  samples can differ significantly in their composition when compared with the  calibration standards and quality control samples that are used to validate the  developed method. The present article attempts to summarize five troubleshooting  cases encountered in the analyses of incurred samples for bioanalytical methods  developed in our laboratory for mesalamine, hydrochlorothiazide, clopidogrel,  sildenafil and rabeprazole. The issues identified were related to: sample  inhomogeneity, sample processing error, impact of buffer pH during sample  preparation, instability of metabolite and change in laboratory environment. The  steps taken to trace and correct these incidents are discussed with adequate  data. These examples will further broaden the scope and emphasize the  significance of ISR.

Data from clinical studies have indicated that  benazepril 5 to 80 mg (usually 10 to 20 mg), administered as a single daily dose,  effectively decreases blood pressure in patients with mild to moderately severe  hypertension. In a small number of comparative studies, the anti-hypertensive  efficacy of benazepril appeared to be at least equivalent to that of captopril,  enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, nitrendipine or propranolol at usual  therapeutic doses. Combinations of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide or  nifedipine achieved a greater lowering of blood pressure than benazepril alone,  and this approach may be suitable for patients with more severe hypertension.  Benazepril is reported to have beneficial effects on various indices of cardiac  function and to improve clinical symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with  congestive heart failure. The tolerability of benazepril in clinical trials has  been very good, with an incidence of adverse effects similar to that observed in  placebo recipients. Thus, benazepril appears to be an effective alternative to  other members of its class for the management of hypertension, and further  studies will accurately define its usefulness in congestive heart failure.","1991-09","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:28:24","","511-539","","3","42","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1720384","","","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Benzazepines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Drug Evaluation; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its pharmacodynamic profile shows a diuretic  efficacy is similar to that of frusemide (furosemide) at doses up to 40 mg, but  the onset and duration of action are comparable to those of hydrochlorothiazide.  Xipamide has been studied mostly in the treatment of mild to moderate essential  hypertension, with few controlled studies of its use in oedematous states. The  efficacy of xipamide 20 to 40 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate  hypertension is comparable to that of bendrofluazide 5 mg, bumetanide 1 mg or  hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg when used alone in newly treated or previously treated  patients. The addition of xipamide 20 to 40 mg daily to regimens containing  beta-blockers, adrenergic neuron-blocking drugs and/or methyldopa has resulted in  a further reduction in blood pressure. A few studies in oedematous states suggest  that xipamide 40 to 80 mg is comparable in efficacy to equal doses of frusemide,  and that the side effects of hypokalaemia, hyperuricaemia and increased blood  glucose in diabetics or latent diabetics are similar to those of other diuretics.  Thus, xipamide is a suitable alternative to other diuretics in the treatment of  mild to moderate hypertension and combines the efficacy of frusemide with a less  abrupt action in the treatment of oedema.","1985-10","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:34:48","","313-332","","4","30","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3905333","","","","Animals; Body Weight/drug effects; Diuretics/*pharmacology; Edema/drug therapy; Electrolytes/urine; Half-Life; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Intestinal Absorption; Kinetics; Tissue Distribution; Urea/blood; Uric Acid/blood; Xipamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this is hampered by the  challenge to transfer kinetics from the laboratory to different field conditions  due to the lack of good quantitative measures to account for different boundary  conditions. For phototransformation, in situ light conditions in a river are  difficult to determine because light is reduced, for instance, by absorption,  scattering on suspended particles, and shading effects. In this study, we present  an approach to separate photochemical from non-photochemical diurnal in-stream  attenuation based on rate constants relative to diclofenac, as a reference  compound, to account for the difference in the in situ light conditions combined  with laboratory experiments. 12 out of 45 detected target TrOCs showed a diurnal  attenuation at a selected river stretch. A non-photochemical process, potentially  biotransformation, was responsible for the diurnal attenuation of bisoprolol,  metoprolol, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, tramadol, and venlafaxine. Attenuation of  amisulpride, flufenamic acid, hydrochlorothiazide, naproxen, and xipamide can be  quantitatively explained by phototransformation, partially for sotalol.  Attenuation rate constants of hydrochlorothiazide at different field sites from  this study and from published data range over 2 orders of magnitude.

In hypertensive  patients, felodipine does not appear to significantly affect glomerular  filtration rate, creatinine clearance, glucose tolerance, or plasma lipoprotein  concentrations. Studies comparing felodipine with other agents as monotherapy in  mild to moderate hypertension have demonstrated felodipine to be at least as  efficacious as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and HCTZ plus amiloride hydrochloride  in combination. Comparisons of felodipine with other agents as adjuncts to  beta-blocker or diuretic therapy have shown felodipine to be at least as  effective as HCTZ, propranolol hydrochloride, prazosin hydrochloride, and  nifedipine. Evaluations of patients with chronic stable angina are limited, and  additional studies are needed before felodipine can be recommended for the  routine management of angina pectoris. Similarly, additional studies are  essential to delineate the role of felodipine, if any, in the management of CHF.  In the management of hypertension, felodipine 5-40 mg/d significantly reduces  systolic and diastolic BP. Although some patients may be controlled throughout  the entire dosing interval when felodipine is administered bid, many patients  will require more frequent dosing to obtain adequate BP control. Adverse effects  associated with felodipine are similar to those of other dihydropyridine  calcium-channel antagonists and include peripheral edema, headache, dizziness,  flushing, and fatigue. A potentially clinically important drug interaction was  observed when felodipine was administered concomitantly with theophylline  aminopropanol; significant decreases in theophylline concentrations were noted.  In summary, felodipine appears to be safe and effective for the management of  hypertension when used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive  agents. The efficacy of felodipine in the management of chronic stable angina  pectoris and CHF requires further investigation.","1991-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:48:14","","1193-1206","","11","25","","DICP","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1763537","","","","Angina Pectoris/drug therapy; Animals; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Double-Blind Method; Felodipine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/therapeutic use; Hypertension/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The bioavailability of pellets (containing 50 mg  hydrochlorothiazide) was determined after oral administration to 6 dogs. A  2(4)-factorial design with central point was used to evaluate the influence of  hydrochlorothiazide (10% and 50%, w/w), HPMC (binder, 4% and 7%, w/w), sorbitol  (0% and 10%, w/w) and water (granulation liquid, low and high level) on pellet  yield, size (Feret mean diameter) and sphericity (aspect ratio and  two-dimensional shape factor, eR). Optimal granulation liquid content depended on  drug and sorbitol level in the formulation. All factors except sorbitol content,  as well as the interactions between drug concentration and binder level and  between drug and water level, were significant (P<0.05) for pellet yield, while a  significant curvature (P<0.05) suggested non-linearity of the response plots. The  model was not significant for pellet shape, while hydrochlorothiazide and water  level as well as their interaction were significant (P<0.05) for pellet size.  Pellet friability, disintegration, residual water content and in-vitro drug  release were determined. Pellets containing 2.5% (w/w) piroxicam were also  evaluated. For both model drugs, pellets with a high yield (>90%), acceptable  sphericity (AR<1.2) and low friability (<0.01%) were obtained. Due to pellet  disintegration, fast dissolution of both hydrochlorothiazide and piroxicam was  achieved: >80% drug released in 30 min.

Previous work has therefore been conducted aiming at a local drug  release in the urinary bladder. However, whether a therapeutically relevant drug  concentration may be reached at the target site is not easy to determine when  applying common compendial dissolution methods. Therefore, the aim of this study  was to develop a biorelevant dissolution model able to take physiological  conditions into consideration, i.e. urine flow rates, urination intervals and  movement patterns during day- and nighttime. The newly developed bladder model  was tested with 3D-printed intravesical inserts containing three different APIs  (lidocaine hydrochloride, trospium chloride and hydrochlorothiazide) and varying  the operating conditions. Although the cumulative drug release was similar to the  compendial method in most cases, notable differences became apparent in the  corresponding concentration profiles of all APIs. It revealed periodic  concentration fluctuations in 24 h intervals due to the constantly changing  volume and agitation in the bladder model. The model furthermore allowed  investigating the influence of varying physiological and pathophysiological  conditions on local drug release.","2022-08-25","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:35:02","","121984","","","624","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Data suggest that serum potassium and magnesium levels  may be normal in the presence of tissue depletion, but decreases in serum levels  are almost always associated with tissue and whole-body depletion of these  electrolytes in patients in whom such depletion cannot be risked. Ventricular  ectopy has also been associated with depletion of potassium and magnesium, which  may explain the increased risk of sudden unexpected death in hypertensive  patients. Any clinician who treats hypertension or congestive heart failure must  consider whether to replete potassium and magnesium in patients already receiving  diuretic therapy, or, better still, consider how to prevent depletion of these  electrolytes in patients in whom such depletion cannot be risked. If prevention  is selected, the clinician must then evaluate the data on available diuretic  combinations for efficacy in electrolyte conservation, bioavailability, and  dosage convenience. The combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide  (Maxzide, 75 mg triamterene/50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) has demonstrated  electrolyte conservation, with bioavailability and dosage convenience.","1987-03-20","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:23:29","","30-37","","3A","82","","Am J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2436474","","","","*Benzothiadiazines; Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*chemically induced; Biological Availability; Cardiac Complexes, Premature/chemically induced; Death, Sudden/etiology; Diuretics; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Hypokalemia/*chemically induced/complications; Magnesium Deficiency/*chemically induced/complications; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Water-Electrolyte Balance/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many advantages, e.g. to improve the  compliance or pharmacodynamic response in comparison to a monotherapy or to  increase the therapy safety. Until now, there are only a few products available  for the paediatric population due to the lack of age appropriate dosage forms or  studies proving the efficacy and safety of these products. This study aims to  develop orodispersible films (ODFs) in a continuous solvent casting process as  child appropriate dosage form containing both enalapril maleate (EM) and  hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) separated in different film layers. Furthermore, they  should be characterised and the API migration analysed by confocal Raman  microscopy (CRM). ODFs were successfully produced in a continuous manufacturing  process in form of double- and triple-layer formulations based on  hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) or a combination of HPC and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).  CRM revealed that both APIs migrate within the film layers shortly after  manufacturing. PVA inhibits the migration inside the double-layer film, but is  not able to prevent the API migration as an interlayer inside a triple-layer ODF.  With increasing film layers, the content of residual solvents and the  disintegration time increases (mono-layer films: <10 s, triple-layer films:  37 s). In conclusion, it was feasible to produce fixed-dose combinations in  therapeutic doses up to 9 mg HCT and 3.5 mg EM for the double-layer film with  adequate mechanical properties, which enable coiling up onto jumbo rolls directly  after production. The best separation of the two APIs was achieved by casting a  double-layer ODF consisting of different film forming polymers, which can be  beneficial when processing two incompatible APIs.","2018-05-30","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:43:56","","236-244","","","117","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In studies using ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring, lacidipine 2 to 8mg administered once daily in the  morning reduced blood pressure over 24 hours, with the reductions being greater  during the day than at night in some studies. 77 to 87% of patients with mild to  moderate hypertension had their blood pressure controlled by treatment with  lacidipine 2 to 8 mg/day for 1 to 4 months in dose-finding studies. When  administered once daily, lacidipine 4 to 6 mg was equivalent in antihypertensive  efficacy to hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg/day, atenolol 50 to 100 mg/day, and  the prototype calcium channel blocker nifedipine 20 to 40 mg twice daily  (sustained-release formulation). The adverse effects of lacidipine are those  common to other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and include headache,  flushing, ankle oedema, dizziness and palpitations. The long term effects of  lacidipine on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and possible additional  clinical benefits in terms of its antiatherosclerotic effects, are under  investigation; the outcome of these studies will be important in defining the  future role of this agent in the treatment of hypertension.

In the present work, pressure-assisted micro syringe printing has  been used to develop flexible drug-loaded inserts applicable via common urinary  catheter that can remain up to several weeks inside the urinary bladder. Three  APIs (lidocaine hydrochloride, trospium chloride (TrCl) and hydrochlorothiazide  (HCT)) with different properties and solubilities were investigated for their  applicability together with two different pharmaceutical polymers (biodegradable  polycaprolactone (PCL) and non-degradable ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer  (EVA)). The fastest release was thereby observed for the PCL-TrCl combination and  the slowest for EVA-HCT depending on the API's solubility in the dissolution  medium and formation of API clusters within the matrix. It was further  demonstrated that the dissolution profile could be modified by adapting drug  loads between 5 and 15 % or the geometry of the printed inserts indicating the  possibility of tailoring release profiles.","2022-06-25","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:35:03","","121849","","","622","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: The study involved  40 patients who were randomly assigned to perindopril 5-10 mg/day in combination  with indapamide retard (P+I) 1.5 mg/day (n = 20) or with hydrochlorothiazide  (P+HT) 25 mg/day (n=20). Waist circumference, body mass index, blood lipids and  glucose, endothelial function (EF) determined as the change of resistance index  after inhalation of salbutamol, arterial stiffness measured as mean pulse wave  velocity after sublingual trinitroglycerin (PWVtng) were evaluated at baseline  and 6 months thereafter. Vascular responses were calculated from digital pulse  waves registered using photoplethysmography. RESULTS: Dynamics of BP after 6  months did not differ significantly between groups. Treatment with combination of  P+HT resulted in significant decrease of EF (-24,3%, p<0,05) accompanied by  negative changes of triglycerides (+13,4%, p<0,05) and glucose levels (+9,8%,  p<0,05), whereas combination of P+I did not affect endothelial function and was  metabolically neutral. PWVtng significantly decreases on both regiments of  treatment with the trend in favor of P+I combination (-13,4%, p<0,001 versus  -9,8%, p<0,01 for P+I and P+HT combinations, respectively). CONCLUSION: Thus,  despite the similar BP reduction the combination of ACE-inhibitor--perindopril  with indapamide retard possesses more favorable vascular and metabolic effects  compared to combination with hydrochlorothiazide that potentially may account for  different prognosis of patients with arterial hypertension on long-term  treatment.","2014","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:38:11","","25-29","","11","54","","Kardiologiia","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 25902655","","","","*Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Hypertension/diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology; *Indapamide/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Perindopril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Biological Availability; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Carbohydrate Metabolism/*drug effects; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Combinations; Drug Monitoring; Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects; Essential Hypertension; Female; Humans; Lipid Metabolism/*drug effects; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Waist Circumference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GLZ is often prescribed along with an  antihypertensive, as many diabetic patients have coexistent hypertension.  Cocrystallization and coamorphization are attractive strategies to enhance  dissolution rates and to reduce the number of medications a patient has to take.  In this work the formation of cocrystals and coamorphous systems of GLZ with  various antihypertensive drugs was studied, namely chlorothiazide (CTZ),  hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ), indapamide (IND), triamterene (TRI) and nifedipine  (NIF) as well as benzamidine (BZA) as a model for the amidine pharmacophore. TRI,  IND and HTZ were found to form coamorphous systems with GLZ that are stable for  at least six months at 22 ± 2 °C and 56% relative humidity. Coamorphous GLZ-TRI  is also stable in dissolution medium. Coamorphization of GLZ-TRI with 15% sodium  taurocholate gave a viable coamorphous formulation with an enhanced dissolution  rate. Comilling of GLZ with BZA and cocrystallization from solution gave the  amorphous and crystalline salt, respectively and the X-ray structure is reported.  During attempts to obtain X-ray suitable cocrystals crystals of Na(+)GLZ(-) and  IND 0.5H(2)O were obtained. Redetermination of the published structure of IND  0.5H(2)O revealed a unit cell with the length of the a axis doubled, a different  space group and no disorder. Liquid-assisted grinding of a 1:1 mixture of GLZ and  IND indicated the transformation of IND to a new solid-state form, while GLZ  remained unaltered.

The GFR is  calculated from the concentration of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in  serum and in urine, respectively. Following current protocols serum and urine  samples must be taken from the same animal. Thus, in order to determine  time-dependent effects it is necessary to use for each time point one separated  group of animals. We developed a statistical test which allows analyzing the GFR  from two different groups of animals: one used for repeated serum and the other  one used for repeated urine analysis. METHODS: Serum and urine samples were taken  from two different sets of rats which were otherwise treated identically, i.e.  drug doses, routes of administration (per os or per inhalation) and tap water  loading. For each dose group GFR mean, standard deviation and statistical  analysis to identify differences between the dose groups were determined.  RESULTS: After determination of the optimal time points for measurements, the  effect on GFR of the three reference compounds, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide  and formoterol, was calculated. The results showed that the diuretic drugs  furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide decreased the GFR and the antidiuretic drug  formoterol increased the GFR, as counter regulation on urine loss or urine  retention, respectively. DISCUSSION: A mathematical model and the corresponding  algorithm were developed, which can be used to calculate the GFR, and to test for  differences between groups from two separated sets of rats, one used for urine,  and the other one for serum analysis. This new method has the potential to reduce  the number of animals needed and to improve the quality of data generated from  various groups of animals in renal function studies.","2007-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:34:07","","277-289","","3","56","","J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17582786","","","","*Glomerular Filtration Rate; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Adrenergic beta-Agonists/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Algorithms; Animals; Consciousness; Diuretics/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Ethanolamines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Female; Formoterol Fumarate; Furosemide/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Hydrochlorothiazide/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Male; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Models, Biological; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the United States, a capsule  formulation containing 50 mg triamterene and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (Dyazide)  is the most popular fixed-combination product. However, several investigators  have confirmed that absorption of both the triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide  components of Dyazide is markedly reduced. This reduced bioavailability may  reduce its effectiveness in hypertensive patients who change from optimally  bioavailable hydrochlorothiazide tablets to Dyazide capsules in an effort to  correct hypokalemia. Scored tablets containing 75 mg triamterene/50 mg  hydrochlorothiazide (Maxzide) have been developed using a patented parallel  granulation manufacturing process and evaluated in a series of  bioavailability-bioequivalence studies. The triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide  components of Maxzide tablets were found to be as bioavailable as liquid  preparations of the active ingredients given singly or in combination. Unlike  Dyazide capsules, the hydrochlorothiazide component of Maxzide tablets was found  to be absorbed to the same extent as single-entity hydrochlorothiazide tablets.  These studies demonstrated that two Dyazide capsules (total of 100 mg  triamterene/50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) deliver to the bloodstream approximately  one-half the quantity of hydrochlorothiazide as one Maxzide (75 mg triamterene/50  mg hydrochlorothiazide) tablet or one 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide tablet.  Similarly, two Dyazide capsules deliver approximately one-half the quantity of  triamterene as one Maxzide tablet. The safety of Maxzide tablets (dose of one  tablet a day) was then evaluated in three groups of hypertensive patients: those  who previously had been given two Dyazide capsules a day, those who had received  four Dyazide capsules a day, and newly diagnosed patients who had received no  medication. The clinical condition of the patients who changed from two or four  Dyazide capsules to one Maxzide tablet was not compromised. Indeed, significant  reductions in blood pressures were observed, especially in some patients who had  remained hypertensive while receiving Dyazide. As expected, the blood pressures  of the previously untreated group also decreased significantly with Maxzide  tablets. Clinically significant hyperkalemia or hypokalemia did not develop.  There were no clinically significant changes in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,  or uric acid levels. In addition to enhanced bioavailability, Maxzide tablets  offer the advantages of once-a-day dosing.","1984-11-05","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:29:23","","52-58","","5A","77","","Am J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6388327","","","","*Antihypertensive Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use; *Hydrochlorothiazide/metabolism/therapeutic use; *Triamterene/metabolism/therapeutic use; Biological Availability; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations/metabolism/therapeutic use; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Hypokalemia/chemically induced; Therapeutic Equivalency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in volume homeostasis and blood  pressure regulation and is a target for several groups of pharmaceutical agents.  Angiotensin II receptor blockers represent the newest class of antihypertensive  compounds. They prevent the binding of angiotensin II to the subtype 1 receptor  (AT(1)), which is believed to mediate most of the physiological actions relevant  to the regulation of blood pressure. Telmisartan, a widely used AT(1) receptor  antagonist, is a highly selective compound with high potency, a long duration of  action and a tolerability profile similar to placebo. Numerous randomized  clinical trials and community-based studies have demonstrated that oral  telmisartan and combinations of telmisartan with hydrochlorothiazide are at least  as effective in lowering blood pressure as all other hypertensive medications.  This has been demonstrated in different populations of adult patients with  mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, including patients with coexisting Type  2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome or renal impairment. Several large-scale,  long-term, clinical endpoint studies are in progress to assess the beneficial  effects of telmisartan on hypertension-related end-organ damage in patients at  high risk of renal, cardiac and vascular damage whose blood pressure is well  controlled. The most recent data from clinical trials and latest research  regarding telmisartan will be reviewed in this article.","2006-09","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:47","","615-629","","5","4","","Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17081084","","","","Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use; Benzoates/therapeutic use; Diuretics/therapeutic use; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Telmisartan; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental results demonstrated  that it is feasible for spiral cross-sectioned titanate nanotubes to carry drugs  and maintain their bioactivity. The structural properties of the composites were  characterized by a range of analytical techniques, including FT-IR, DSC, TG-MS,  etc. The interactions between APIs and TNTs were identified as electrostatic  attractions, mainly dominated by hydrogen bonds. Based on the results, it can be  stated that the strength of the association depends on the hydrogen donor  strength of the API. The drug release of incorporated APIs was evaluated from  compressed tablets and compared to that of pure APIs. Differences noticed in the  dissolution profiles due to incorporation showed a correlation with the strength  of interactions between the APIs and the TNTs observed in the above analytical  studies.","2017-02-25","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:42:38","","119-129","","1-2","518","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

DRSP/E2 lowers  blood pressure when used alone in hypertensive postmenopausal women or when  administered concomitantly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or  angiotensin receptor blockers. DRSP/E2 has not been studied in combination with  the widely prescribed hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). We investigated the effects of  3 mg DRSP/1 mg E2 versus placebo on blood pressure and potassium balance when  added to existing therapy with 25 mg HCTZ in postmenopausal women with  established stage I hypertension. DESIGN: This was a single-center, double-blind,  randomized, placebo-controlled, two-treatment, two 4-week treatment period  crossover study in 36 postmenopausal women with stage I hypertension maintained  on 25 mg HCTZ. The endpoint was a change from baseline in systolic and diastolic  blood pressures by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Safety  monitoring included serum potassium (mEq/L) and adverse events. RESULTS: Mean  systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure  monitoring were reduced significantly, by -7.2 and -4.5 mm Hg, respectively, with  DRSP/E2 as compared with placebo. The decrease in potassium with HCTZ was 0.2  mEq/L less with DRSP/E2 than placebo, suggesting a potassium-sparing effect. The  most frequently observed adverse events with DRSP/E2 were vaginal bleeding and  breast tenderness, which were attributable to the hormone therapy. CONCLUSIONS:  DRSP/E2 substantially lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure when added to  existing antihypertensive therapy with HCTZ in hypertensive postmenopausal women.  In addition, DRSP/E2 has a potassium-sparing effect that counteracts HCTZ-induced  potassium loss.","2007-06","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:34:47","","408-414","","3 Pt 1","14","","Menopause","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17224857","","","","Aged; Androstenes/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use; Blood Pressure Determination/methods; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Female; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy/prevention & control; Middle Aged; Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists/*therapeutic use; Postmenopause/drug effects; Potassium/blood; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NaCl absorption from luminal  SW was enhanced 10-fold in the esophagus of SW-acclimated eels, and removal of  Na(+) or Cl(-) from luminal SW abolished the facilitated absorption, indicating  coupled transport. Mucosal/serosal application of various blockers for  Na(+)/Cl(-) transporters profoundly decreased the absorption. Among the  transporter genes expressed in eel esophagus detected by RNA-seq, dimethyl  amiloride-sensitive Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE3) and  4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive Cl(-)/[Formula: see text]  exchanger (AE) coupled by the scaffolding protein on the apical membrane of  epithelial cells, and ouabain-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-ATPases (NKA1α1c and NKA3α)  and diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid-sensitive Cl(-) channel (CLCN2) on the  basolateral membrane, may be responsible for enhanced transcellular NaCl  transport because of their profound upregulation after SW acclimation.  Upregulated carbonic anhydrase 2a (CA2a) supplies H(+) and [Formula: see text]  for activation of the coupled NHE and AE. Apical hydrochlorothiazide-sensitive  Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporters and basolateral Na(+)-[Formula: see text]  cotransporter (NBCe1) and AE1 are other possible candidates. Concerning the low  water permeability that is typically seen in marine teleost esophagus,  downregulated aquaporin genes (aqp1a and aqp3) and upregulated claudin gene  (cldn15a) are candidates for transcellular/paracellular route. In situ  hybridization showed that these upregulated transporters and tight-junction  protein genes were expressed in the absorptive columnar epithelial cells of eel  esophagus. These results allow us to provide a full picture of the molecular  mechanism of active desalination and low water permeability that are  characteristic to marine teleost esophagus and gain deeper insights into the role  of gastrointestinal tracts in SW acclimation.","2017-02-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:43:44","","R231-R244","","2","312","","Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28003213","","","","Animals; Cell Membrane Permeability/physiology; digestive tracts; Eels/*physiology; epithelial transport; Esophagus/*physiology; Gastrointestinal Absorption/*physiology; Ion Channel Gating/physiology; Saline Waters/*pharmacokinetics; Salt Tolerance/*physiology; Seawater; seawater acclimation; Sodium Chloride/pharmacokinetics; Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters/*physiology; teleost fish","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined six  drugs that show clinical bioequivalence between the ODTs and IR formulations:  taltirelin, olopatadine, droxidopa, famotidine, fexofenadine, and  hydrochlorothiazide. The dissolution profiles of these drugs were evaluated using  the compendium paddle apparatus at pH 1.2 and 6.8. Taltirelin and olopatadine  showed very rapid dissolution and met the dissolution criteria in the BWS,  whereas droxidopa, famotidine, fexofenadine, and hydrochlorothiazide did not.  Furthermore, in the case of famotidine, fexofenadine, and hydrochlorothiazide,  the ODTs and IR formulations showed dissimilar dissolution profiles. The  dose-to-solubility ratio (D:S) of these drugs was larger than that of the other  drugs. The results of this study suggest that extension of the BCS-BWS to ODTs  and IR formulations of BCS class III drugs is appropriate. Furthermore, for BCS  class III drugs with relatively high D:S, clinical bioequivalence would be  achievable even when two formulations showed different dissolution profiles in  vitro.","2014-11-20","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:33:26","","37-43","","","64","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While in  heart failure rats combined therapy initially improved cardiac function and  prognosis, this benefit was completely lost at later stages. We now studied renal  effects of adding hydrochlorothiazide to ACE inhibitor after myocardial  infarction in rats. Rats were randomized to ACE inhibitor quinapril monotherapy  or quinapril with add-on hydrochlorothiazide. Survival was monitored for 14  months. Plasma creatinine, measured at 4 months, was increased by 40% in  quinapril with add-on hydrochlorothiazide compared to quinapril. Although overall  14-months mortality was similar in quinapril with add-on hydrochlorothiazide and  quinapril, stratification based on plasma creatinine showed increased mortality  in the tertile with highest plasma creatinine (P=0.03, Log rank). With add-on  hydrochlorotiazide, renal morphology displayed severe renal interstitial lesions;  tubular dilatation and fibrosis. Interstitial myofibroblast transformation  (alpha-smooth muscle actine staining) was increased at 8 and 14 months, and  coincided with collagen deposition and interstitial inflammation (macrophage  influx). In rats with quinapril monotherapy or untreated rats, renal structure  was normal. Thus, adding hydrochlorotiazide to ACE inhibitor detrimentally  affected not only renal function, but also renal structure in rats with  myocardial infarction. Altered pharmacokinetics, resulting from a vicious circle  of reduced renal function and increased circulating drug levels, may provide an  explanation for the adverse renal effects and may exert unfavorable effects on  long-term prognosis after myocardial infarction.","2009-01-14","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:46:01","","373-379","","2-3","602","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19084001","","","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Animals; Biomarkers/blood; Diuretics/*adverse effects; Heart/physiopathology; Hydrochlorothiazide/*adverse effects; Kidney/*drug effects/pathology/*physiopathology; Male; Myocardial Infarction/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Prognosis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Survival Rate; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  Drugs or vehicle were administered for 8 weeks to SHRSP and blood pressure was  measured weekly by tail-cuff plethysmography. After 8 weeks, superoxide levels in  carotid arteries and aortas were measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence and  p22phox expression quantified by immunohistochemistry. In vitro the effects of  exposure to drugs and vehicle for 30 min and 4 h on superoxide levels and nitric  oxide bioavailability were examined. The latter was expressed as the increase in  contractile responses of carotid arteries to phenylephrine in the presence of the  nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester(l-NAME).  RESULTS: In vivo irbesartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide/hydralazine  produced similar falls in blood pressure, from 162 +/- 4 to 125 +/- 5, 132 +/- 4  and 131 +/- 6 mmHg, respectively, but irbesartan caused a greater reduction in  superoxide and p22phox; superoxide levels in carotid arteries being 3.1 +/- 0.3,  1.1 +/- 0.2, 1.9 +/- 0.3 and 2.0 +/- 0.3 nmoles/mg per min, respectively. In  vitro 4 h exposure to irbesartan decreased superoxide levels in the aorta from  2.08 +/- 0.68 to 1.48 +/- 0.62 nmoles/mg per min and increased nitric oxide  bioavailability in carotid arteries. Neither 30 min incubation with irbesartan  nor 4 h with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide/hydralazine altered superoxide  levels. CONCLUSIONS: These studies support the hypothesis that AT1 receptor  blockade has beneficial effects on superoxide production and nitric oxide  bioavailability above that of other classes of antihypertensive agents.

OBJECTIVE: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCZ) is a BCS Class IV  drug with low solubility and low permeability. The present work aimed to increase  the solubility of hydrochlorothiazide using blends of natural and synthetic  hydrotropes. METHODS: Two hydrotropes one from natural (piperazine) and other  from the synthetic origin (sodium benzoate) were selected for the formulation of  solid dispersion (SD) of HCZ. Preliminary trial batches were prepared by  considering the safe dose of both the selected hydrotropes i.e. sodium benzoate  (SB) and piperazine (PP). A 32 full factorial design was opted for preparing the  optimized solid dispersion of hydrochlorothiazide. RESULTS: The quadratic models  were found to be best fitted for the studied responses, which were percent  solubility and in-vitro drug release. The results showed increased solubility and  in-vitro drug release of HCZ solid dispersions as a function of increasing levels  of both hydrotropes.

After a three-week single-blind placebo period, eligible patients were  randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to one of three treatment groups for  a one-week titration period and a nine-week efficacy period. Patients received  either nifedipine GITS, 30 or 60 mg daily; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 or 50 mg  daily; or placebo. Sitting and standing blood pressures decreased by an average  11.6/10.4 and 10.8/10.8 mm Hg, respectively, with nifedipine GITS therapy, and  14.8/10.8 and 14.3/8.2 mm Hg, respectively, with hydrochlorothiazide therapy.  Compared with placebo, these changes were highly significant for both sitting (p  less than or equal to 0.005) and standing (p less than or equal to 0.02)  measurements.

Co-crystallization was achieved after dissolving hydrochlorothiazide with  increasing molar ratios of sucralose in the least amount of acetone. The  co-crystallization products were characterized using Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. These  measurements indicated that co-crystallization process started at a drug  sucralose molar ratio of 1:1 and completed at 1:2.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether  interindividual variability in the response to ACE inhibitors is explained by the  ""ACE phenotype""-for example, variability in plasma ACE concentration, activity,  and conformation and/or the degree of ACE inhibition in each individual. METHODS:  The ACE phenotype was determined in plasma of 14 patients with hypertension  treated chronically for 4 weeks with 40 mg enalapril (E) or 20 mg E + 16 mg  candesartan (EC) and in 20 patients with hypertension treated acutely with a  single dose (20 mg) of E with or without pretreatment with hydrochlorothiazide.  The ACE phenotyping included (1) plasma ACE concentration; (2) ACE activity (with  2 substrates: Hip-His-Leu and Z-Phe-His-Leu and calculation of their ratio); (3)  detection of ACE inhibitors in patient's blood (indicator of patient compliance)  and the degree of ACE inhibition (ie, adherence); and (4) ACE conformation.  RESULTS: Enalapril reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in most  patients; however, 20% of patients were considered nonresponders. Chronic  treatment results in 40% increase in serum ACE concentrations, with the exception  of 1 patient. There was a trend toward better response to ACEI among patients who  had a higher plasma ACE concentration. CONCLUSION: Due to the fact that ""20% of  patients do not respond to ACEI by blood pressure drop,"" the initial blood ACE  level could not be a predictor of blood pressure reduction in an individual  patient. However, ACE phenotyping provides important information about  conformational and kinetic changes in ACE of individual patients, and this could  be a reason for resistance to ACE inhibitors in some nonresponders.","2017-07","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:33:49","","374-386","","4","22","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28587581","","","","*Pharmacogenomic Variants; *Precision Medicine; ACE conformation; ACE inhibitor; ACE phenotyping; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/therapeutic use; angiotensin-converting enzyme; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds; blood pressure; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Drug Monitoring; Drug Resistance/genetics; Drug Therapy, Combination; Enalapril/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Genotype; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/therapeutic use; hypertension; Hypertension/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/physiopathology; nonresponders; Patient Selection; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*genetics/metabolism; Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacogenomic Testing; Phenotype; Predictive Value of Tests; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Tetrazoles/therapeutic use; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Saturation of one or both tanks led to dose-dependent absorption. The model was  used to simulate absorption of chlorothiazide. Good agreement between simulated  and experimental data led to the conclusion that the physical characteristics of  chlorothiazide, rather than a saturable transport mechanism at the intestinal  wall, may be responsible for the dose-dependent absorption observed for this  drug. The model was also used to simulate hydrochlorothiazide absorption. By  applying the same system parameters used for chlorothiazide, the model simulation  correctly predicted the dose proportionality of hydrochlorothiazide absorption.  The lack of dose dependency in this case may be attributed to the higher  solubility and pK alpha of hydrochlorothiazide compared with chlorothiazide.","1984-09","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:20:44","","1274-1279","","9","73","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6548523","","","","*Intestinal Absorption; Chemical Phenomena; Chemistry, Physical; Chlorothiazide/metabolism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/metabolism; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism; Software; Solubility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the  investigated coformers, nicotinamide (NIC) was identified as a suitable coformer.

The investigation of  extruded filaments using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed the  formation of HCTZ-NIC cocrystals, which was further confirmed using Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction analysis  (PXRD). The 3D-printed printlets of HCTZ-NIC with 50 % infill density resulted in  improved dissolution and permeability compared to pure drug.

First, we  cloned cDNAs encoding NKCC2β and NCCβ from the intestinal tract of Japanese eel.  In both freshwater- and seawater-acclimated eels, quantitative PCR analysis  showed that NKCC2β was predominantly expressed in the anterior and posterior  intestines, and that NCCβ expression was specifically high in the rectum.  According to immunohistochemistry with anti-eel NKCC2β (reacting with NKCC2β but  not with NCCβ) and T4 antibody (reacting with both NKCC2β and NCCβ), NKCC2β was  localized in the apical surface of the epithelial cells in the anterior and  posterior intestines, whereas NCCβ was likely to be distributed to that in the  rectum. Furthermore, a specific NCC inhibitor, hydrochlorothiazide, inhibited of  Na(+) and Cl(-) absorption, as well as water absorption, in the rectal sac  preparations from seawater eel, indicating the involvement of NCCβ in ion  absorption in the rectum.

The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of local pH  change in the intestinal tract by magnesium oxide on the intestinal absorption of  hydrochlorothiazide, a model poorly water-soluble weak-acid compound. The  application of hydrochlorothiazide granule containing magnesium oxide to the rat  intestinal loop increased the pH in the vicinity of the dosing site to more than  8.5 for 90 min without any mucosal damage. As a result, absorption of  hydrochlorothiazide increased by the addition of magnesium oxide to the granule.  Intraintestinal administration of a suspension prepared from hydrochlorothiazide  granules with magnesium oxide increased the intestinal absorption and the AUC  value was 3-fold higher than that without magnesium oxide. To further increase  the intestinal absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, we prepared granules containing  magnesium oxide and chitosan as a mucoadhesive and tight junction opening  material. Chitosan showed a marked increase of intestinal absorption, and the AUC  value after the administration of suspensions of chitosan granules was more than  5-fold higher than that of granules containing hydrochlorothiazide alone,  respectively. In summary, it has been clarified that the intestinal absorption of  weak-acidic poorly water-soluble compound can be enhanced by increasing local pH,  mucoadhesion and opening tight junction.","2013-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:24:21","","1887-1894","","12","39","","Drug Dev Ind Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 22443480","","","","*Intestinal Absorption; Animals; Area Under Curve; Chitosan/*chemistry; Excipients/chemistry; Hydrochlorothiazide/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Magnesium Oxide/*chemistry; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Solubility; Tight Junctions/metabolism; Time Factors; Water/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The effects  of HCTZ and AEDs on convulsions were examined in the maximal electroshock seizure  (MES) test in mice. Additionally, adverse effects of combined treatment with HCTZ  and the AEDs in the passive avoidance task and chimney test were assessed. All  drugs were injected intraperitoneally (ip) at single doses. RESULTS: The data  obtained indicate that HCTZ (100 mg ip) enhanced the anticonvulsant action of  CBZ, decreasing its ED(50) value from 11.9 to 7.7 mg/kg (p < 0.05), and had no  impact on the antielectroshock activity of the other AEDs. The observed  interaction between HCTZ and CBZ was not pharmacokinetic in nature as HCTZ did  not alter free plasma (non-protein-bound) and total brain concentrations of CBZ.  The combined treatment with HCTZ and the AEDs was free from side-effects on motor  performance and long-term memory in mice. CONCLUSIONS: To the degree, the  experimental data can be transferred to clinical conditions, the use of a single  dose of HCTZ in patients receiving VPA, PHT, PB, OXC, LTG or TPM, seems neutral  regarding their anticonvulsant potency. Acute HCTZ may positively influence the  anticonvulsant action of CBZ in epileptic patients.","2012","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:29:27","","315-320","","2","64","","Pharmacol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 22661181","","","","*Electroshock; Animals; Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Avoidance Learning/drug effects; Brain/metabolism; Disease Models, Animal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Synergism; Drug Therapy, Combination; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Male; Memory, Long-Term/drug effects; Mice; Motor Activity/drug effects; Seizures/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Tissue Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both doses resulted in an initial natriuresis and diuresis. After 1 day of  treatment the natriuresis abated, but the diuresis persisted. The mechanisms  responsible for these chronic effects were investigated by performing clearance  and micropuncture studies on all animals; collections were made from late  proximal tubules and from early and late regions of distal tubules. Values for  total glomerular filtration rate and single-nephron filtration rate in  thiazide-treated rats were not significantly different from those in control  animals. The delivery of sodium to the end of the proximal convoluted tubule was  considerably reduced in each group of thiazide-treated rats. Although sodium  delivery to the early distal tubule was also significantly lower than in control  animals, the difference had disappeared by the late distal tubule. It is  concluded that the return of sodium excretion to control levels during chronic  hydrochlorothiazide administration is a consequence of increased fractional  reabsorption by the proximal tubules, secondary to a thiazide-induced sodium  depletion. This results in less sodium being delivered to the nephron site at  which thiazides exert their major inhibitory effect. Fluid delivery to the end of  the proximal convoluted tubule and to the early distal tubule was significantly  reduced in thiazide-treated rats; in animals given the higher dose of diuretic it  was also significantly reduced at the end of the distal tubule. Nevertheless, in  both thiazide-treated groups urine flow rate was elevated, suggesting that  reabsorption of water from the collecting ducts is reduced during chronic  thiazide administration.","1986-04","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:45:24","","379-387","","4","70","","Clin Sci (Lond)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3698514","","","","Animals; Body Water/metabolism; Body Weight; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacology; Kidney/*drug effects/physiology; Male; Potassium/urine; Rats; Sodium/urine; Tissue Distribution; Urodynamics/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the presence of vasopressin,  hydrochlorothiazide (0.1 mM) markedly reduced the net rate of Na absorption, Cl  absorption, and active fluid absorption but did not significantly change the  transepithelial voltage. Similarly, in the absence of vasopressin,  hydrochlorothiazide decreased the rate of sodium absorption by 50% without  affecting transepithelial voltage. Amiloride (30 microM) completely eliminated  the lumen-negative voltage but decreased net sodium absorption only by  approximately 50%. In the presence of amiloride, chloride absorption occurred  against an electrochemical gradient for chloride, indicating that there was  active chloride absorption. Bumetanide (0.1 mM) did not affect chloride  absorption or spontaneous fluid absorption in the presence of vasopressin. The  combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide inhibited net sodium absorption  by a greater extent than did either agent alone. These results demonstrate the  presence of the following two parallel sodium transport pathways in cortical  collecting ducts from mineralocorticoid-replete rats: 1) an electrogenic pathway  blocked by amiloride, which presumably involves an apical sodium channel, and 2)  a thiazide-inhibitable electroneutral pathway, which presumably utilizes apical  Na-Cl cotransport and mediates secondary active transport of chloride.","1990-09","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:43:54","","F519-528","","3 Pt 2","259","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2396677","","","","Absorption; Amiloride/pharmacology; Animals; Biological Transport; Bumetanide/pharmacology; Chlorides/pharmacokinetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacology; Kidney Cortex; Kidney Tubules, Collecting/*metabolism; Kidney Tubules/*metabolism; Male; Ouabain/pharmacology; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Sodium Chloride/*pharmacokinetics; Sodium/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renal physiology","","1522-1466 1931-857X","10.1152/ajprenal.00668.2016","","We assessed effects of acute volume reductions induced by administration of diuretics in rats. Direct block of Na(+) transport produced changes in urinary  electrolyte excretion. Adaptations to these effects appeared as alterations in  the expression of protein for the distal nephron Na(+) transporters NCC and ENaC.  Two hours after a single injection of furosemide (6 mg/kg) or hydrochlorothiazide  (HCTZ; 30 mg/kg) Na(+) and K(+) excretion increased but no changes in the content  of activated forms of NCC (phosphorylated on residue T53) or ENaC (cleaved  γ-subunit) were detected. In contrast, amiloride (0.6 mg/kg) evoked a similar  natriuresis that coincided with decreased pT53NCC and increased cleaved γENaC.  Alterations in posttranslational membrane protein processing correlated with an  increase in plasma K(+) of 0.6-0.8 mM. Decreased pT53NCC occurred within 1 h  after amiloride injection, whereas changes in γENaC were slower and were blocked  by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone. Increased γENaC  cleavage correlated with elevation of the surface expression of the subunit as  assessed by in situ biotinylation. Na depletion induced by 2 h of furosemide or  HCTZ treatment increases total NCC expression without affecting ENaC protein.  However, restriction of Na intake for 10 h (during the day) or 18 h (overnight)  increased the abundance of both total NCC and of cleaved α- and γENaC. We  conclude that the kidneys respond acutely to hyperkalemic challenges by  decreasing the activity of NCC while increasing that of ENaC. They respond to  hypovolemia more slowly, increasing Na(+) reabsorptive capacities of both of  these transporters.","2017-07-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:38","","F62-F73","","1","313","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28356292  PMCID: PMC5538837","","","","amiloride; Amiloride/pharmacology; Animals; Diuretics/*pharmacology/toxicity; ENaC; Epithelial Sodium Channels/*drug effects/metabolism; Female; furosemide; Furosemide/pharmacology; hydrochlorothiazide; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; hyperkalemia; Hyperkalemia/blood/chemically induced/*metabolism/urine; Hypovolemia/blood/chemically induced/*metabolism/urine; Male; Models, Biological; NCC; Nephrons/*drug effects/metabolism; Phosphorylation; Potassium/blood/*metabolism/urine; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Renal Elimination/drug effects; Sodium/blood/*metabolism/urine; Solute Carrier Family 12, Member 3/drug effects/metabolism; Spironolactone/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of these, only  36.8% have their blood pressure reduced to recommended levels of lower than  140/90 mmHg for uncomplicated hypertension, or less than 130/80 mmHg for patients  with diabetes mellitus or renal disease. Since monotherapy controls blood  pressure in less than 50% of treated hypertensive patients, combination therapy  is often required to bring blood pressure to the recommended levels of the 7th  Joint National Committee report. One of the most effective and widely used  combinations is the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or  angiotensin receptor blocker with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Aliskiren, a new  blocker of the renin-angiotensin system has been developed and approved by the US  FDA on 18th January 2008 for the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren is a direct  inhibitor of renin, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of angiotensin  II, a powerful vasoconstrictive peptide. Several randomized clinical trials have  demonstrated that aliskiren administered in single daily doses of 150, 300 or 600  mg alone and in combination with HCTZ 12.5 and 25 mg is effective in lowering  blood pressure, and is safe and well tolerated.

We compared in a randomized,  double-blind study the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan 80 mg combined with  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg to monotherapy with either HCTZ 12.5 mg or 25  mg in patients with essential hypertension inadequately controlled by previous  HCTZ 12.5 mg monotherapy. Two hundred and seventeen patients whose blood pressure  (BP) control remained poor (95 mmHg < or = sitting diastolic BP < 115 mmHg) after  a 4-week single-blind period with HCTZ 12.5 mg were randomized to receive either  combination therapy with valsartan 80 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg (V/HCTZ) or  monotherapy with HCTZ 12.5 mg or HCTZ 25 mg for 8 weeks. Reduction of sitting  trough diastolic BP between baseline and week 8 as well as tolerability was  evaluated. Reduction in trough diastolic BP was most pronounced in the V/HCTZ  group (-11.3 mmHg) and significantly greater than in the HCTZ 12.5 mg group (-2.9  mmHg, p < 0.001) and the HCTZ 25 mg group (-5.7 mmHg, p < 0.001). Tolerability of  study medication was comparable between all three groups.

Hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) was formulated with acetaminophen (APAP) and  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Dissolution methods and limits are reported in the  USP/NF. Standard operating procedures (SOP) for the HP 8452A spectrophotometer  and Vanderkamp 600/6010 Dissolution Tester were followed according to the GMP  Manual. A dissolution method was developed for each formulation based on the  above. The only discrepancy between high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  and standard dissolution testing occurred when comparing the results of the  HPC/HCTZ formulation. The ultraviolet (UV) samples were filtered through a  10-micron filter, and the HPLC samples were filtered through a 0.2-micron filter.  When the HPC/HCTZ samples were filtered through a 10-micron filter for both UV  and liquid chromatography (LC), the results were equal. Filter pore size and area  have a large effect on concentration of HPC/HCTZ. The smaller the pore size and  the smaller the diameter of the filter, the more HPC/HCTZ is filtered out. HCTZ  has a greater tendency to interact with HPC in the filter than other active  ingredients tested. HPC and HCTZ levels have little or no effect on the amount of  HCTZ lost.","2000-03","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:22:17","","337-342","","3","26","","Drug Dev Ind Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10738651","","","","*Tablets; Acetaminophen/pharmacokinetics; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacokinetics; Cellulose/analogs & derivatives/chemistry; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*standards; Diuretics; Filtration; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacokinetics; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Solubility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies were conducted in vitro and in healthy female  mongrel dogs under fasting conditions. In the canine model, both the rate and  extent of paracetamol and hydrochlorothiazide absorption were significantly  decreased by the coadministration of 15 g guar gum dissolved in 500 ml normal  saline. In the case of cimetidine, the rate but not extent of absorption was  decreased. Owing to the high variability in the data, no statistically based  conclusion could be drawn about the effects of coadministered guar gum on the  oral absorption of the poorly soluble mefenamic acid. Based on the in vitro data,  it appears that substantial reductions in the dissolution rate of paracetamol,  hydrochlorothiazide and cimetidine account for the effects observed in vivo. It  is concluded that the effect of an elevation in the intraluminal viscosity on  drug absorption is greatest for highly soluble drugs, and results from a  combination of a decrease in dissolution rate and gastric emptying rate.","1998-04","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:35:33","","131-139","","2","6","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 9795031","","","","*Pharmacokinetics; Acetaminophen/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Animals; Area Under Curve; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Cimetidine/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Dogs; Female; Galactans/*pharmacology; Gastric Emptying/drug effects; Hydrochlorothiazide/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; Mannans/*pharmacology; Mefenamic Acid/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Plant Gums; Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fused-filament fabrication (FFF) offers a platform  for the personalization of drug dosage forms, but one of its chief shortcomings  compared to other tablet production methods such as dry compression and wet  granulation is relatively low throughput. Conversely, injection molding (IM) is a  manufacturing technique for the high-volume production of parts, but in which  individual part customization is both expensive and slow requiring the  modification of expensive mold tooling. Mass-customization is the manufacture of  custom products that match the needs of individual consumers but which are  produced at the low unit cost associated with high-volume production. We  successfully integrated for the first time FFF with IM in a multi-step  manufacturing process for the production of custom bilayer tablets loaded with  two active pharmaceutical ingredients used in the treatment of cardiovascular  disease. The FFF layer was loaded with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, while  the IM layer was loaded with lovastatin. Infill percentage was varied for the FFF  layer as a means to modify drug release. The IM injection pressure was evaluated  for its effect on drug release and layer-layer adhesion. The bilayer tablets  obtained offered different combinations of drug release profiles, which were  governed by a combination of factors, including surface area to volume ratio; IM  injection volume penetration into the FFF layer; FFF infill percentage; layer  tortuosity and porosity. These different parameters could be utilized to modify  the individual release of both drugs from the bilayer tablet. Thus for the first  time, we have demonstrated a viable method for the mass-customization of oral  tablets which could hasten the rollout of personalized medicine.","2019-10-05","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:32:52","","118611","","","569","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Exercise was performed under control conditions (CON; placebo),  and after 4 days of diuretic administration (DIU; Novotriamazide; 100 mg  triamterene and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide). DIU resulted in a calculated  reduction of PV by 14.6 +/- 3.3% (P < 0.05). Rates of glucose appearance (R(a))  and disappearance (R(d)) and glycerol R(a) were determined by using primed  constant infusions of [6,6-(2)H]glucose and [(2)H(5)]glycerol, respectively. No  differences in oxygen uptake during exercise were observed between trials. Main  effects for condition (P < 0.05) were observed for plasma glucose and glycerol,  such that the values observed for DIU were higher than for CON. No differences  were observed in plasma lactate and serum free fatty acid concentrations either  at rest or during exercise. Hypohydration led to lower (P < 0.05) glucose R(a)  and R(d) at rest and at 15 and 30 min of exercise, but by 60 min, the effects  were reversed (P < 0. 05). Hypohydration had no effect on rates of whole body  lipolysis or total carbohydrate or fat oxidation. A main effect for condition (P  < 0.05) was observed for plasma glucagon concentrations such that larger values  were observed for DIU than for CON. A similar decline in plasma insulin occurred  with exercise in both conditions. These results indicate that diuretic-induced  reductions in PV decreases glucose kinetics during moderate-intensity dynamic  exercise in the absence of changes in total carbohydrate and fat oxidation. The  specific effect on glucose kinetics depends on the duration of the exercise.","2000-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:36:08","","E1383-1390","","6","279","","Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11093927","","","","Adult; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Dehydration/chemically induced/*metabolism/physiopathology; Deuterium; Dietary Carbohydrates/pharmacokinetics; Dietary Fats/pharmacokinetics; Diuretics/administration & dosage; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/blood; Glucagon/blood; Glucose/pharmacokinetics; Glycerol/blood/pharmacokinetics; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Insulin/blood; Lactic Acid/blood; Liver/*metabolism; Male; Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism; Oxygen Consumption/physiology; Physical Exertion/*physiology; Plasma Volume/drug effects/*physiology; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/pharmacology; Triamterene/administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To classify the binders, they were compared in a binary  mixture of binder and dicalciumphosphate and another formulation including a  drug. Tensile strength and dissolution properties of tablets compressed from  powders or granules were the focus of this study. Tablets containing the small  copovidone and the small crospovidone showed the best binder properties in terms  of large granule size, low fine particle fraction, and high tensile strength  values. Dissolution behavior revealed a significant difference between these two  binders.

The two  copovidones showed comparable dissolution behavior, although tensile strength was  higher for the type with small particles.

Electrogenic Na(+) reabsorption via epithelial Na(+) channels  (ENaCs) in the apical membrane of the segment-specific CNT and collecting duct  cells may promote H(+)-ATPases-mediated proton secretion by creating a more  lumen-negative voltage. The exact localization where this supposed functional  interaction takes place is unknown. We used several mouse models performing renal  clearance experiments and assessed the furosemide-induced urinary acidification.  Increasing Na(+) delivery to the CNT and CCD by blocking Na(+) reabsorption in  the thick ascending limb with furosemide enhanced urinary acidification and net  acid excretion. This effect of furosemide was abolished with amiloride or  benzamil blocking ENaC action. In mice deficient for the IC-specific B1 subunit  of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, furosemide led to only a small urinary  acidification. In contrast, in mice with a kidney-specific inactivation of the  alpha subunit of ENaC in the CCD and MCD, but not in the CNT, furosemide alone  and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide induced normal urinary acidification.  These results suggest that the B1 vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit is necessary for  the furosemide-induced acute urinary acidification. Loss of ENaC channels in the  CCD and MCD does not affect this acidification. Thus, functional expression of  ENaC channels in the CNT is sufficient for furosemide-stimulated urinary  acidification and identifies the CNT as a major segment in electrogenic urinary  acidification.","2006-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:27:10","","1706-1716","","10","70","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16985514","","","","Acid-Base Equilibrium/*drug effects/physiology; Amiloride/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Animals; Diuretics/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Epithelial Sodium Channels/genetics/metabolism; Furosemide/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kidney Tubules, Collecting/metabolism; Kidney Tubules, Distal/*drug effects/metabolism; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects/physiology; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Nephrons/drug effects/physiology; Proton-Translocating ATPases/genetics/*metabolism; Water-Electrolyte Balance/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, acetazolamide, a diuretic clinically administered for  glaucoma, is excreted from the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular  secretion. In this study, we investigated the interaction and transport of these  diuretics via the rat renal organic anion transporter rOAT1 by using Xenopus  laevis oocyte expression system. p-[(14)C]Aminohippurate (PAH) uptake by  rOAT1-expressing oocytes was inhibited in the presence of a thiazide  (chlorothiazide, cyclothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide), a loop diuretic  (bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, furosemide), or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor  (acetazolamide, ethoxzolamide, methazolamide).

Although the  loop diuretics had little trans-stimulation effect on [(14)C]PAH efflux via  rOAT1, the rOAT1-mediated furosemide uptake was observed.

Drug concentrations in plasma  and blood from the carotid artery and renal vein were assayed by a simple  modified HPLC method. Renal extraction ratios were concentration-independent with  a mean of 0.17 +/- 0.05 (SD). The renal excretion was found to occur primarily  from the drug in plasma; the mean net fractional removal from plasma was 0.57 +/-  0.12, while that from RBC was less than 0.008 +/- 0.041. The virtual total  unavailability of HCTZ from RBC (containing approximately 70% of drug in arterial  blood) for renal excretion is attributed to relatively slow efflux of drug from  RBC to plasma during each passage through the kidney compared with the blood  transit time (in seconds). Preliminary in vitro influx and efflux kinetics of  HCTZ across RBC membranes were studied using rat and human blood. The flux data  could be adequately described by a linear, reversible, closed two-component  system model, and the mean equilibration half-times (ET1/2) in rat and human  blood were 10.9 and 20.5 min, respectively. The mean residence time of drug in  blood circulation of rats was estimated to be 8.32 +/- 1.06 min, which is shorter  than the ET1/2. This is consistent with data indicating that distribution  equilibrium of HCTZ in arterial blood might not be reached in vivo even at steady  state. Other implications of slow transport kinetics of drugs across RBC  membranes are discussed.","1992-03","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:30:37","","212-218","","3","81","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1640355","","","","Adult; Animals; Arteries; Blood Proteins/metabolism; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism; Erythrocytes/*metabolism; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Infusions, Intravenous; Kidney/*metabolism; Male; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Veins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two indices of microvascular  dysfunction, urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) and albumin vascular clearance  (AVC) in the eye, were studied in control and streptozocin diabetic Wistar Kyoto  (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: Studies were performed  on four groups of untreated rats--nondiabetic and diabetic WKY and nondiabetic  and diabetic SHR--and on three groups of diabetic SHR treated with a converting  enzyme inhibitor (perindopril), a calcium-channel blocker (lacidipine), or triple  therapy (hydrochlorothiazide, reserpine, and hydralazine). In all rats, AER and  AVC were measured at 16 weeks. RESULTS: There was a progressive increase in both  parameters in the order WKY, diabetic WKY, SHR, and diabetic SHR. When compared  with nondiabetic WKY, diabetic SHR showed an approximately 30-fold increase in  AER and an approximately threefold increase in AVC. Treatment of diabetic SHR  with perindopril or triple therapy normalized AER compared to an equihypotensive  dose of lacidipine, which had no effect. By contrast, the three antihypertensive  regimens showed a different order of efficacy in preventing increases in ocular  AVC. In diabetic SHR, the increase in retinal AVC was prevented largely by  lacidipine, whereas the other two antihypertensive regimens showed lesser effects  [AVC expressed as percentage nondiabetic WKY: untreated diabetic SHR 278% +/-  47%, lacidipine 93% +/- 10% (P < 0.001), triple therapy 132% +/- 37% (P < 0.05),  and perindopril 167% +/- 9% (P < 0.05)]. Lacidipine also prevented the increase  in AVC of the anterior and posterior uvea. By contrast, increases in AVC observed  in the diabetic SHR were not prevented by perindopril in the posterior uvea or by  triple therapy in the anterior uvea. Thus, hypertension and diabetes increased  ocular AVC and AER, and effective antihypertensive therapy substantially  prevented changes in both parameters. However, despite equivalent levels of blood  pressure control for each regimen, discordant effects were noted on AVC and AER.  Perindopril was associated with significantly lower AER than lacidipine, whereas  lacidipine was more potent in preventing increases in ocular AVC. CONCLUSIONS:  Results of this study suggest that different antihypertensive regimens in the  diabetic rat may exert organ-specific effects on the retina and kidney despite  equivalent effects on systemic blood pressure. These data also raise the  possibility that retinal microvascular dysfunction in diabetes is ameliorated  more readily by calcium-channel blockade than by converting-enzyme inhibition,  whereas the reverse applies to renal microvascular dysfunction, as reflected by  albuminuria.","1996-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:32:30","","281-289","","2","37","","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8603832","","","","Albuminuria/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use; Blood Pressure; Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use; Capillary Permeability; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/metabolism; Diabetic Retinopathy/drug therapy/*metabolism; Dihydropyridines/therapeutic use; Drug Therapy, Combination; Hydralazine/therapeutic use; Hydrochlorothiazide/therapeutic use; Hypertension, Renal/drug therapy/*metabolism; Indoles/therapeutic use; Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism; Male; Organ Specificity; Perindopril; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Rats, Inbred WKY; Reserpine/therapeutic use; Retina/drug effects/*metabolism; Serum Albumin/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate this issue, we studied 20 hypertensive adult patients  receiving hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/d to determine if there are significant  differences between the administration of 24 mEq of Slow-K given as 8 mEq/tablet  tid, and 30 mEq of K-Tab given as a 10 mEq/tablet tid.

Results  from this study indicate that 24 mEq of Slow-K and 30 mEq of K-Tab were equally  effective in maintaining serum electrolyte concentrations, blood pressure  measurements, and electrocardiogram evaluations within normal limits in all 20  hypertensive patients studied. Furthermore, no adverse effects were noted with  either potassium chloride formulation, and patient acceptance, tolerability, and  compliance to prescribed dosing regimens were similar for both products.

Chromatography was carried out on C18 column with mobile phase  comprising of acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and methanol in the ratio of 40:60 (v/v)  pumped at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and UV detection was employed at 230 and 275  nm. The average retention times for hydrochlorthiazide, frusemide, quinidine,  propranolol, and verapamil were 4.9, 5.8, 6.9, 8.9 and 11.3 min, respectively.  The calibration curves were linear (R(2)>0.9995) in the selected range for each  analyte. The method is specific and sensitive with limit of quantification as 25  ng/ml for quinidine and verapamil. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and  precision were found to be good for all the five analytes. The method was found  to be reliable in permeability determination and to estimate pH-dependent  P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux transport of quinidine. Weak bases  quinidine, propranolol and verapamil showed pH-dependent permeability, where  quinidine permeability increased by 3.6-fold when the luminal pH was changed from  pH 4.5-7.4. Inhibition of P-gp by verapamil (200 microM) indicated that about 68%  and only 35% of passive transport of quinidine was attenuated by P-gp-mediated  efflux at pH 4.5 and 7.4, respectively.

The results  are described of the multi-centre U.S. clinical programme demonstrating the  effectiveness and tolerance of indapamide for the treatment of hypertension. All  work was conducted under U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration guidelines,  and resulted recently in a New Drug Application. A total of 1891 subjects or  patients participated in 27 separate studies conducted by 91 investigators. In  controlled clinical trials comparing 2.5 mg indapamide once daily with 50 mg  hydrochlorothiazide once daily for 40 weeks in patients with mild to moderate  essential hypertension, indapamide produced a reduction of supine blood pressure  of -9.5/-14.3 mmHg as compared with -7.6/-11.4 mmHg for hydrochlorothiazide. In  combination with methyldopa, propranolol, clonidine, guanethidine and  hydralazine, indapamide consistently produced a greater decrease in arterial  pressure than did those agents given alone. Indapamide added to these step-care  agents did not result in a meaningful increase in adverse reactions. Indapamide  has been the subject of a long-term safety study in which over 100 hypertensive  patients have been followed up for 2 years or longer. During this period of time,  indapamide was well tolerated and remained effective. No biochemical,  electrocardiographic or ophthalmological changes were associated with its use.  Other studies with indapamide are discussed describing the systemic and renal  haemodynamic effects, pharmacokinetic properties and special safety studies  conducted with this agent. The use of indapamide in patients with hepatic or  renal impairment is reviewed in detail.","1983","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:45:09","","109-122","","","8 Suppl 3","","Curr Med Res Opin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 6352183","","","","Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage; Biological Availability; Clinical Trials as Topic; Diuretics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Drug Therapy, Combination; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Hypertension/*physiopathology; Indapamide/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Renal Circulation/drug effects; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peak drug concentration usually precedes maximal uricosuria  following a single dose of 40 mg of benzbromarone, since benzarone, one of the  two metabolites, likewise has a uricosuric action. Longterm studies in 24 gouty  patients indicate that the drug is well tolerated. It has not produced any skin  rash or renal colic. Renal hemodynamics, blood picture, and liver enzymes were  unchanged. Since it is eliminated by the biliary tract, it may cause diarrhoea in  some patients. Being a very potent uricosuric agent, it is not advocated in  patients with a history of uric acid lithiasis. The uricosuric effect is not  liable to be counteracted when used in conjunction with hyperuricemic diuretics.

Treatment continued for up to 4 years. At  treatment end, 578 (65.1%) patients were on telmisartan monotherapy, 106 (11.9%)  were on telmisartan + HCTZ 12.5 mg, 101 (11.4%) were on telmisartan + HCTZ 25 mg,  and 103 (11.6%) were on telmisartan + another antihypertensive + HCTZ. Overall,  84.4% (746/884) patients achieved DBP control. The highest proportion of  responders was in the telmisartan monotherapy (40 or 80 mg) treatment category  (89.0% 1,511/574 patients]).

Most  adverse events were of mild-to-moderate intensity and unrelated to treatment. The  proportions of patients discontinuing the study due to adverse events, by  treatment at onset, were 7.3% (65/888) with telmisartan monotherapy, 6.6%  (20/304) with telmisartan + HCTZ and 2.9% (3/103) with telmisartan + another  antihypertensive +/- HCTZ. There were 15 deaths during the study, but none was  considered drug related. Thus, telmisartan alone or in combination with other  antihypertensives achieved and maintained clinically relevant reductions in DBP  and SBP.

ARF was  induced in rats by a single injection of cisplatin-induced acute renal failure  (ARF). ARF was induced in rats by a single injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg,  i.v.). Prophylactic treatment with KW-3902 (0.01-1 mg/kg, p.o., twice a day)  significantly attenuated the increases of serum creatinine (S-CRE) and urea  nitrogen (S-UN) induced by cisplatin. On the other hand, neither furosemide nor  trichlormethiazide showed any ameliorating effects against the cisplatin-induced  ARF. In the clearance study, the cisplatin-treatment induced marked decreases of  glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and reabsorptions of  water, sodium and potassium at tubular sites, in comparison with those in  untreated normal rats. KW-3902 (0.1 mg/kg, p.o., twice a day) significantly  improved these deteriorated glomerular and tubular functions. In the rats with  established cisplatin-induced ARF, KW-3902 ameliorated the cisplatin-induced  reductions of GFR, RPF, and reabsorptions of water, sodium and potassium at  tubular sites. These results suggest that activation of adenosine A1-receptors is  involved in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced ARF.

A higher bioavailability can reduce both the applied dosage and the side effects  for the patient. One method of increasing the bioavailability is to reduce the  particle size of the drug down to the nanoscale. An innovative procedure for the  preparation of particles in the submicron size range is spray drying with aerosol  conditioning, followed by subsequent separation of the particles in an  electrostatic precipitator (ESP). This process has been tested before in an  earlier work with aqueous model substances at high production rates (1 g/h) and  narrow particle-size distributions (mannitol: d(50,0) = 455 nm, span = 0,8) in  the submicron range. Spray drying from an aqueous solution with low drug  concentrations (<1 wt-%) leads to particles in the lower nanosize range, but the  low concentrations make this process inefficient. A custom-made plant was  modified in order to handle the organic spray-drying process. In addition,  explosion protection had to be considered. This work focuses on the spray drying  of submicron particles from organic solvents for the purpose of increasing the  dissolution rate of the API griseofulvin. API particles were successfully  produced in the submicron size-range, characterized and the dissolution behavior  was investigated. The dissolution time to dissolve 80% of the drug, t(80), was  reduced from 21.5 min for the micronized grade API to 8.5 min for the submicron  product.","2019-08-15","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:20:33","","118501","","","567","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The present experiments were  designed to localize expression of message for the TSC in rat and human kidney. A  riboprobe, generated from the mouse TSC, was used for in situ hybridization.  Simultaneous immunocytochemistry, using antibodies to Tamm-Horsfall protein, band  3, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, permitted delineation of specific nephron  segments. In rat, message for the TSC was highly expressed in DCT cells but not  elsewhere. The transition from thick ascending limb to DCT was abrupt, whereas  the transition to CNT was gradual. In the more distal region of rat DCT (DCT-2),  which contained few intercalated cells, both TSC message and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger  immunoreactivity were present. Treatment of rats with furosemide for 5 days  increased expression of TSC message within the DCT but did not induce its  expression elsewhere. In humans, expression of TSC message was also highest in  cells of the DCT. In humans, however, expression extended well into the CNT.  These experiments indicate that the TSC is expressed predominantly by DCT cells  in both rat and humans, although expression extends into the CNT cells in humans.  They also show that the TSC and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger are coexpressed by a  subpopulation of DCT cells near the junction with the CNT.","1995-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:33:19","","F900-910","","6 Pt 2","269","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8594886","","","","*Symporters; Animals; Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Furosemide/pharmacology; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacology; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Hybridization; Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism; Male; Mice; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rats/*metabolism; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Sodium Chloride Symporters; Tissue Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In situ permeability, as a function of luminal pH, was  also determined in the presence of P-gp inhibitor, verapamil (500 microM).  Octanol/buffer partition coefficient, transport across artificial membrane, and  rat in situ permeability showed high pH-dependency. Absorption quotient (AQ),  calculated from in situ permeability to express the functional activity of P-gp,  declined with increase in luminal pH or increase in luminal quinidine  concentration because of the increased passive permeability or saturation of  P-gp. AQ was 0.57 +/- 0.02 and 0.41 +/- 0.05, while passive permeability was 0.32  +/- 0.01 x 10(-4) cm/sec and 0.43 +/- 0.02 x 10(-4) cm/sec, in jejunum and ileum,  respectively, at pH 7.4. Further, apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (K(M),  J(P-gp,max)) for the quinidine efflux in jejunum indicated that efflux activity  was more at luminal pH 4.5 over pH 7.4. K(M) values for jejunum quinidine efflux  at pH 4.5 and pH 7.4 were determined to be 77.63 +/- 10.90 and 22.86 +/- 5.22  microM, with J(P-gp,max) values of 1.47 +/- 0.08 and 0.62 +/- 0.04 nM/cm2/sec,  respectively. AQ vs passive permeability showed significant relationship  indicating dependency of P-gp-mediated efflux on pH-dependent passive  permeability, which is dictated by ionization status for a protic or ampholytic  drug. In conclusion, an orally administered drug is absorbed from various  segments of intestine, which inherit difference in luminal pH, transcellular  permeability and P-gp expression. In situ data suggests that pH-dependency and  regional variability in passive permeability of protic substrates significantly  influence their P-gp-mediated efflux and may have implications on predictions of  the in vivo drug absorption.","2005-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:44:59","","2632-2643","","12","94","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16258992","","","","*Intestinal Absorption; Animals; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Biological Transport; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Furosemide/pharmacokinetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacokinetics; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ileum/*metabolism; Jejunum/*metabolism; Membranes, Artificial; Perfusion; Permeability; Propranolol/pharmacokinetics; Quinidine/*pharmacokinetics; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Verapamil/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been reported in  the literature that the source of starch, particle size, amount of sodium  chloride (reaction by-product), viscosity, degree of substitution and  cross-linking affect the functionality of sodium starch glycolate. Compendial  assays provide an accurate representation of the chemical quality of an  excipient, but they are not useful in describing the physical properties  associated with the excipients. Physical characterization of sodium starch  glycolate, NF revealed differences in particle size, surface area, porosity,  surface morphology, and viscosity between two of the three sources examined. An  automated liquid uptake test (in neutral and acidic medium) demonstrated similar  initial rates of uptake, however, the extent of liquid uptake differed for the  disintegrant powders examined.

Since enhanced  proximal solute and water reabsorption only partially account for the reduction  in urinary volume, an additional diuretic effect on nephron terminal segments was  postulated. Thus the aim of our work was to investigate the effect of  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on water transport in the inner medullary collecting  duct (IMCD) of normal and Brattleboro rats. Osmotic water permeability (P(f)) and  diffusional water permeability (P(dw)) were studied at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 by  the in vitro microperfusion technique. In the absence of antidiuretic hormone  (ADH), HCTZ (10(-6) M) added to the perfused fluid enhanced P(f) from 6.36 +/- 0.  56 to 19.08 +/- 1.70 micro(m)/s (P < 0.01) and P(dw) from 38.01 +/- 4.52 to 52.26  +/- 4.38 x10(-5) cm/s (P < 0.01) in normal rats and also stimulated P(f) in  Brattleboro rats from 3.53 +/- 1.41 to 11.16 +/- 1.13 micro(m)/s (P < 0.01).

These data indicate that thiazides enhance water absorption in IMCD from normal  rats (in the absence of ADH) and from Brattleboro rats and that the  HCTZ-stimulated P(f) was partially blocked by PGE(2).

Rats were either sham operated or were subjected to 1 1/3 nephrectomy (4/6 Nx). Each group was either  untreated or was treated with enalapril (EN) or the drug regimen of hydralazine,  hydrochlorothiazide, and reserpine (HHR). Four weeks after surgery rats were  injected with iodinated aggregated bovine serum albumin (I-aggBSA) and mesangial  localization quantified 2, 4, or 8 h later. Mesangial kinetics in untreated 4/6  Nx rats were characterized by accumulation of I-aggBSA to 4 h after injection  with rapid clearance over the 4-8-h period; i.e. mesangial trafficking was  increased following 4/6 Nx. Mesangial trafficking in 4/6 Nx rats treated with EN  was reduced by virtue of lesser uptake of I-aggBSA at 4 h and retarded clearance  over 4-8 h when compared with untreated 4/6 Nx animals. Treatment of 4/6 Nx rats  with HHR maintained the increased trafficking observed in untreated 4/6 Nx rats.  At 30 weeks untreated 4/6 Nx rats had severe albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis.  Both indices of renal damage were significantly less in 4/6 Nx rats treated with  enalapril. Treatment with HHR did not prevent albuminuria and had only limited  effectiveness in preventing glomerulosclerosis. The different effects of EN and  HHR on mesangial trafficking and glomerulosclerosis provide further evidence for  a relationship between mesangial trafficking following partial renal ablation and  subsequent development of glomerulosclerosis.","1994","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:33:20","","131-137","","2","9","","Nephrol Dial Transplant","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8190327","","","","Albuminuria/etiology/prevention & control; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/classification/*pharmacology; Biological Transport, Active; Enalapril/pharmacology; Glomerular Mesangium/*drug effects/*metabolism; Hydralazine/pharmacology; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Hypertrophy; Kidney Glomerulus/pathology; Kinetics; Male; Nephrectomy/adverse effects; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reserpine/pharmacology; Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacokinetics; Tissue Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine the effect of several kaliuretic stimuli on this intrinsic  renal K+-conserving mechanism, kidneys from K+-depleted rats perfused with 3.5  mmol/L K+ were subjected to an experimental maneuver after 45 minutes of  perfusion under normal conditions. Fractional potassium excretion (FEK) remained  stable in time controls during a subsequent 45 minutes of perfusion.  Acidification of the perfusate to pH 6.96 by addition of HCI had no significant  effect on FEK. Alkalinization to pH 7.7 by either addition of NaHCO3 or a  reduction in PCO2 resulted in significant kaliuresis (FEK 26% vs. 15%), which  appeared to be a direct result of systemic alkalinization. Addition of Na2SO4 to  the perfusate also produced significant kaliuresis (FEK 29%), which could not be  dissociated from the magnitude of the natriuresis. Although both alkalosis and  sulfate increased K+ excretion by depleted kidneys, FEK was much lower than with  kidneys from normal rats perfused at pH 7.4 (FEK 51%). Thus the intrinsic renal  K+-conserving mechanism dramatically diminishes the kidneys' kaliuretic potency  and probably accounts for the blunted kaliuretic effect of these stimuli during  K+ depletion in vivo. An increase in sodium excretion and urine flow rate  achieved by lowering the perfusate albumin concentration, increasing the  perfusate pressure, or adding the diuretics hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide  resulted in significant kaliuresis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1986-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:43:47","","176-184","","2","107","","J Lab Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3944497","","","","Absorption; Acidosis/metabolism; Alkalosis, Respiratory/metabolism; Alkalosis/metabolism; Animals; Bicarbonates/metabolism; Furosemide/*pharmacology; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; In Vitro Techniques; Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism; Male; Potassium/*metabolism; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Sodium/metabolism; Sulfates/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This randomized controlled trial  was designed to assess the value of hydrochlorothiazide in the ablation of  thyroid remnant with 131I. METHODS: Thirty consecutive DTC patients with thyroid  remnant after thyroid surgery were divided into two groups by randomization, the  hydrochlorothiazide group received hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tid for 4 days, the  control group received placebo. Responses to treatment were evaluated by the  increment of thyroid 131I uptake rate at 24 h and the augmentation of 131I  absorbed dose. RESULTS: In the hydrochlorothiazide group, the 24 h 131I uptake  rate was about (1.36+/-0.58) times larger than that before treatment, the  absorbed dose was about (1.35+/-0.54) times larger than that before treatment.

The application of vacuums to the microwave drying process might  be interesting, especially for thermally sensitive products because the reduced  boiling point of the solvent allows a lower temperature processing. The objective  of the present work is to study and evaluate the process of drying a granulated  product that is the basis of the drug hydrochlorthiazide, with an initial  moisture content of 21% in dry basis. This study monitored the drying kinetics,  product temperature and power absorbed by the sample using a bench scale vacuum  microwave dryer. The equipment consisted of a cylindrical pressure vessel crossed  by a wave guide, setting up a system whereby the vacuum pressure, the sample  weight and the incident, reflected and residual microwave powers could be  measured and evaluated, throughout the entire process. The experimental runs were  established with an approximate incident microwave power at 20 W for absolute  pressure levels of 50 and 75 mbar, working with samples of about 1.4 g. It was  observed that the vacuum microwave process kinetics at both pressure levels  showed little difference. The processes were carried out almost entirely in a  regime of water evaporation, the product's temperature remaining below the  solvent boiling temperature. The drying times were similar for both processes,  whereas the absorbed power was slightly higher at the pressure of 75 mbar.","2007","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:29:02","","241-250","","4","40","","J Microw Power Electromagn Energy","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17847678","","","","*Microwaves; Absorption; Adsorption; Calorimetry; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/*methods; Equipment Design; Hydrochlorothiazide/*chemistry; Kinetics; Pressure; Solvents; Technology, Pharmaceutical/*methods; Temperature; Time Factors; Vacuum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When added to the mucosal solution, 1  mM HTZ had no effect on Na transport or proton secretion, but significantly  increased mucosa-to-serosa Ca45 flux at 60 minutes (control 118.9 +/- 39.7  pmol/mg/60 min versus thiazide 286.0 +/- 64.9 pmol/mg/60 min, N = 16, P less than  0.02). In the presence of 5 X 10(-4) M ouabain, a maneuver which inhibits active  Na transport, HTZ again significantly enhanced mucosa-to-serosa Ca45 flux. The  increment of calcium transport under these conditions was 83.4 +/- 35.2  pmol/mg/60 min (N = 8, P less than 0.05). Mucosal HTZ had no effect on  serosa-to-mucosa (that is, bath-to-lumen) Ca45 flux after a 60 minute incubation.  Serosal addition of HTZ had no effect on either of the unidirectional Ca45 fluxes  or on Na transport. Mucosal tissue Ca45 content was enhanced by HTZ (mucosal) in  the presence or absence of ouabain.

In  the present study, the contribution of the ileal and jejunal methionine  absorption to the dietary induced hyperhomocysteinemia was evaluated by measuring  the mucosal to serosal fluxes and the enterocyte incorporation in intact  intestinal epithelia mounted in Ussing chambers. For 4 mo, 20 miniature pigs were  daily fed control or metcas diets, and an oral combination of an  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (25 mg captopril, Cp) and diuretic (12.5  mg hydrochlorothiazide, HTZ) or placebo, ileal incorporation was higher in  epithelia from miniature pigs metcas than in that from other groups. For a given  transepithelial flux of methionine, i.e., a constant amount of methionine  recovered in the serosal chamber, a greater enterocyte incorporation was  detected. Cp-HTZ treatment corrected the diet-induced methionine trapping in  intestinal epithelia but had little effect in control animals. In separate in  vitro experiments, Cp added alone significantly activated methionine fluxes in  epithelia from metcas-fed miniature pigs as it did in vivo, demonstrating that Cp  rather than HTZ mainly contributed to the in vivo effects of the drug  combination. Our results showed that the regulation of intestinal methionine  absorption compensated the diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and that Cp-HTZ  treatment altered these adaptative changes without increasing methioninemia and  homocysteinemia.","1995-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:25:10","","3011-3019","","12","125","","J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7500179","","","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Animals; Captopril/*pharmacology; Caseins/*pharmacology; Disease Models, Animal; Diuretics; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Epithelium/metabolism; Homocysteine/blood; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects/physiology; Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism; Jejunum/metabolism; Male; Methionine/*metabolism; Random Allocation; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/pharmacology; Swine; Swine, Miniature; Tritium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since ENaC does not transport  Cl(-), the purpose of this study was to determine how ENaC modulates Cl(-)  absorption. Thus, Cl(-) absorption was measured in CCDs perfused in vitro that  were taken from mice given aldosterone for 7 days. In wild-type mice, we observed  no effect of luminal hydrochlorothiazide on either Cl(-) absorption or  transepithelial voltage (V(T)). However, application of an ENaC inhibitor  [benzamil (3 μM)] to the luminal fluid or application of a Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase  inhibitor to the bath reduced Cl(-) absorption by ∼66-75% and nearly obliterated  lumen-negative V(T). In contrast, ENaC inhibition had no effect in CCDs from  collecting duct-specific ENaC-null mice (Hoxb7:CRE, Scnn1a(loxlox)). Whereas  benzamil-sensitive Cl(-) absorption did not depend on CFTR, application of a  Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransport inhibitor (bumetanide) to the bath or ablation of  the gene encoding Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) blunted  benzamil-sensitive Cl(-) absorption, although the benzamil-sensitive component of  V(T) was unaffected. In conclusion, first, in CCDs from aldosterone-treated mice,  most Cl(-) absorption is benzamil sensitive, whereas thiazide-sensitive Cl(-)  absorption is undetectable. Second, benzamil-sensitive Cl(-) absorption occurs by  inhibition of ENaC, possibly due to elimination of lumen-negative V(T). Finally,  benzamil-sensitive Cl(-) flux occurs, at least in part, through transcellular  transport through a pathway that depends on NKCC1.","2012-07-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:33:54","","F45-55","","1","303","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22496413  PMCID: PMC3431594","","","","*Epithelial Sodium Channel Blockers; Absorption/drug effects; Aldosterone/pharmacology; Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Animals; Biological Transport/drug effects; Chlorides/*metabolism; Epithelial Sodium Channels/genetics/metabolism; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Kidney Tubules, Collecting/drug effects/*metabolism; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/pharmacology; Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters/*metabolism; Sodium/metabolism; Solute Carrier Family 12, Member 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sufficient drug  should be administered to achieve a therapeutic effect, yet not so much as to  produce unwanted side effects. One desirable effect of hydrochlorothiazide, for  example, is the control of hypertension. An undesirable effect is excessive  potassium loss. The dosage range that is likely to cause the hypotensive effect  without the potassium loss has been called the ""therapeutic window."" In  principle, hydrochlorothiazide can be combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic,  such as triamterene, to lower blood pressure with a decreased risk of  hypokalemia, and thus to ""widen"" the therapeutic window. The term ""dose,""  however, requires further description. Because of compliance problems we know  that the patient does not necessarily adhere to the prescribed dosage schedule.  Furthermore, because of the bioavailability of the pharmaceutical formulation,  the dose the patient ""takes"" may not be the one that he or she actually gets. The  formulation of the drug product determines how rapidly and completely the active  ingredient of the drug dissolves in the gastrointestinal tract and subsequently  gets absorbed into the bloodstream. Thus, the time course of the drug  concentration in serum has become the measure of dose that is most directly  related to dose-response relationships. Incompletely absorbed drug products are  said to be poorly bioavailable. Such products are undesirable, not only because  the patient receives a dosage that is on the average less than that expected, but  also because poor bioavailability may lead to a great variation in dose. Thus,  poorly bioavailable drug formulations increase the variability in dose-response  relationships among patients and as a result jeopardize the attainment of  therapeutic objectives.","1984-11-05","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:51","","47-51","","5A","77","","Am J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6496559","","","","Biological Availability; Digoxin/adverse effects/metabolism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*metabolism/therapeutic use; Triamterene/administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three routes of metabolism, that is,  acetylation, generation of free radicals (leading to peroxidation of lipids), and  osazone formation were considered in relation to the structures of these drugs.  The possibility that acetylation can lead to hepatic toxicity, lipid peroxidation  to membrane lesion, and osazone formation to glucose and energy depletion was  highlighted. Hydralazine, with its potential for osazone formation and great  susceptibility to acetylation and free radical formation, was judged most capable  of giving rise to these side effects, in agreement with reported toxicity.

In  order to act, they must be secreted into the tubular lumen. This transfer of the  drug to its site of action may be blocked by decreased renal blood flow, the  saturation of the systems of tubular transport or fixation to the albumin present  in the primary urine. All these pharmacokinetic abnormalities (observed in renal  failure or the nephrotic syndrome) lead to diuretic resistance. Increasing the  dosage, the repetition, intravenous administration, even as an infusion, are  possible solutions. Resistance may be observed in the absence of pharmacokinetic  abnormalities: in these cases, there is an abnormal response of the tubular cells  to otherwise effective diuretic concentrations, or the activation of homeostatic  mechanisms leading to sodium retention and preventing negativisation of the salt  and water balance. These situations are often associated in cardiac failure or  cirrhosis with oedema. Increasing the dosage is not a logical solution, but  increasing the frequency of administration may be helpful. The importance of  secondary hyperaldosteronism in cirrhotic oedema makes spironolactone the  treatment of choice. In all cases, the addition of two mechanisms of inhibition  of tubular reabsorption of sodium at different sites in the nephron often results  in an effective diuresis: usually, this implies the addition of a thiazide (e.g.  hydrochlorothiazide) to an initial prescription of a loop diuretic.","1998-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:24:11","","1383-1388","","11","91","","Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 9864608","","","","Diuretics/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Drug Resistance; Edema; Fibrosis; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Homeostasis; Humans; Kidney Tubules/*drug effects/physiology; Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thiazide diuretics may exert their effect  on Cl- transport across rabbit distal colon through inhibition of a Cl(-)-HCO-3  exchange mechanism.

In intact  tissue, in the absence of CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) in the media, the opening of these  channels causes an approximately 7-mV depolarization of the apical membrane. This  has been shown to be a constant index of the total Cl(-) conductance (G(Cl))  activated. The effect of exogenous and endogenous CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) on the  depolarization has now been investigated in the intact tissue by conventional  microelectrodes. The anion exchange has been measured radiochemically. The  presence of exogenous or endogenous CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) reduces the depolarization  induced by HCTZ, phlorizin and DPC from approximately 7 to 3 mV, but 10(-4) mol/l  acetazolamide restores the full depolarization. Response time, S(0.5) and Hill  number are unchanged in each case. The way of bicarbonate replacement is  irrelevant. The depolarization generated by phenylglyoxal, which covalently binds  to the transport site of the exchanger and prevents HCO(3)(-) binding, is  unaffected by CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) presence. HCO(3)(-) binding to the transport site  is suggested to partially hinder the conversion of the exchanger into the  channel.","2001-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:33:31","","137-143","","2","54","","Bioelectrochemistry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 11694394","","","","Animals; Anions/pharmacokinetics; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology; Bicarbonates/pharmacology; Carbon Dioxide/pharmacology; Chloride Channels/*drug effects/physiology; Chloride-Bicarbonate Antiporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology; Chlorine/*pharmacokinetics; Electric Conductivity; Electrophysiology; Gallbladder/chemistry/cytology; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Kinetics; Male; Membrane Potentials/drug effects; Microelectrodes; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Phlorhizin/pharmacology; Rabbits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 17 normal subjects and 30 patients with absorptive  hypercalciuria (AH), there was a significant (P less than 0.001) correlation of  alpha with the Ca load responses, (r = 0.81). However, this correlation was not  observed in patients with renal hypercalciuria (RH), and those with AH receiving  thiazide or orthophosphate. In RH, 38 per cent of patients had elevated Ca load  responses, despite normal values for alpha. The point correlating the calciuric  response and alpha in these patients was below the 95 per cent confidence limit  of the line correlating alpha and the load response. Thus, Ca load response often  overestimated intestinal Ca absorption, because of the high basal (fasting)  urinary Ca. Thiazide therapy in RH improved the correlation between the two tests  of Ca absorption. However, thiazide therapy in AH produced normal Ca load  responses despite persistently high alpha in 60 per cent of patients. Similarly,  50 per cent of patients with AH receiving orthophosphate had normal Ca load  response, although alpha remained elevated. Thus, Ca load response underestimated  Ca absorption when patients with AH took thiazide or orthophosphate, probably  because these drugs augment renal tubular reabsorption of Ca. These data support  the Ca load test as a valid indirect measure of intestinal Ca absorption in  normal subjects and patients with AH, in whom fasting urinary Ca is not elevated.  In conditions of renal Ca, leak or with various drugs known to alter renal Ca  handling, there seen to be large deviations of Ca load response from alpha. Care  should be exercised before reaching conclusions regarding the intestinal Ca  absorption in these situations.","1981-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:47:01","","161-164","","3","19","","Invest Urol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7298284","","","","*Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; Administration, Oral; Calcium Radioisotopes/metabolism; Calcium/*metabolism/pharmacology/urine; Feces/analysis; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage; Intestinal Diseases/drug therapy/metabolism; Kidney Diseases/drug therapy/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TCM (100 microM) in the lumen  increased JCa in the CNT without affecting lumen-negative transepithelial voltage  (VT). This effect was dependent on the amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH, 0.1 or  1 nM) in the bath. TCM had no detectable effect on JCa in the absence of PTH.  Addition of 100 microM ouabain to the bath decreased PTH-stimulated JCa and  abolished the TCM-stimulated JCa. Elimination of Na+ from the lumen increased  PTH-stimulated JCa. Under this condition the ability of TCM to increase JCa was  abolished, suggesting that the inhibition of Na+ entry from the lumen with TCM  may account for the increase in PTH-stimulated JCa. Elimination of Na+ from the  bath in the presence of PTH decreased JCa and abolished the stimulatory effect of  TCM on JCa in the presence of PTH. Changes in VT caused by amiloride may not  account for the increase in JCa, because JCa was not changed when VT was  deflected to more positive direction by increasing bath K+ from 5 to 15 mM.  Neither TCM nor amiloride affected JCa in the CCD. From these observations, we  speculate that the inhibition of Na+ entry across the apical cell membrane by  either thiazides or amiloride may stimulate PTH-induced JCa.

In order to accurately measure AUC,  multiple blood samples are required, but in a clinical setting, frequent blood  sampling from the patients is time-consuming and expensive. The limited sampling  model (LSM) is one of the approaches that is gaining popularity due to its  simplicity for the estimation of AUC using 1 - 3 samples. Despite its simplicity,  the LSM has some shortcomings. One of the major drawbacks of the LSM is that the  LSM developed under a given condition may not be extended to other conditions.  For example, the LSM developed from healthy subjects may not be extended to  disease states such as renal or hepatic impairment or vice versa. This  characteristic of the LSM can be referred to as ""center-specific"". In this  investigation, the LSM developed from the healthy subjects was used to predict  AUC in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. METHODS: Two sets of simulated  plasma concentration versus time data for 2 antihypertensive drugs and measured  plasma concentration versus time data for 2 representative drugs (A and B) were  used in the analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate  that the LSM developed from healthy subjects is inadequate to predict AUC in  patients with hepatic or renal impairment, indicating center specificity of the  LSM.","2003-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:29:56","","517-523","","11","41","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 14651035","","","","*Models, Biological; Antihypertensive Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics; Area Under Curve; Benzimidazoles/blood/pharmacokinetics; Benzoates/blood/pharmacokinetics; Blood Specimen Collection/*methods; Computer Simulation; Drug Monitoring/methods; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/blood/pharmacokinetics; Liver Failure/*blood; Renal Insufficiency/*blood; Telmisartan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been demonstrated to actively interfere  with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This is reflected by both  hemodynamic (decreased blood pressure) and humoral (increased plasma renin,  angiotensin I, and decreased angiotensin II) responses to enalapril therapy.  Activity in the kallikrein-bradykinin system is still controversial. Enalapril  maleate is a prodrug which is quickly absorbed, hydrolyzed by the liver to the  active metabolite enalaprilic acid, and excreted 33 percent in the bile and 61  percent in the urine. The therapeutic dosage range is 10-40 mg/d, maximum of 40  mg, given once or twice daily. The onset and duration of action are dose related.  Vertigo and headache have been the most commonly reported side effects. Clinical  comparison of enalapril to hydrochlorothiazide, beta-adrenergic blockers, and  captopril find it efficacious in the treatment of essential hypertension.  Efficacy in treating congestive heart failure and hypertension secondary to renal  artery stenosis has also been demonstrated for both angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitors. The overall efficacy and safety of enalapril and captopril appear  equivalent when used at low doses in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.","1986-03","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:33:15","","177-186","","3","20","","Drug Intell Clin Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3007062","","","","*Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Biotransformation; Drug Interactions; Enalapril/administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Intestinal Absorption; Kinetics; Tissue Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic potential.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199141010-00008","","Torasemide (torsemide) is a high-ceiling loop diuretic which acts on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle to promote rapid and marked excretion of  water, sodium and chloride. Like furosemide (frusemide), its major site of action  is from the luminal side of the cell. Torasemide is at least twice as potent as  furosemide on a weight-for-weight basis, produces equivalent diuresis and  natriuresis at lower urinary concentrations and has a longer duration of action,  allowing once-daily administration without the paradoxical antidiuresis seen with  furosemide. Torasemide also appears to promote excretion of potassium and calcium  to a lesser extent than furosemide. In trials of up to 48 weeks' duration in  patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, torasemide, administered  as a single daily dose, has been shown to achieve adequate blood pressure control  reaching steady-state within 8 to 12 weeks. Those patients not responding  initially have generally responded to a doubling of the dose. Comparative trials  of up to 6 months show torasemide is as effective as indapamide,  hydrochlorothiazide or a combination of triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide in  maintaining control of blood pressure. Torasemide has also been used successfully  to treat oedematous states associated with chronic congestive heart failure,  renal disease and hepatic cirrhosis. In short term trials control of blood  pressure, bodyweight and residual oedema has been sustained. Torasemide appears  to be a useful alternative to furosemide in these patients, providing potent and  long-lasting diuresis while being relatively potassium and calcium sparing. In  clinical trials to date torasemide has been well tolerated with adverse effects  of a mild, transient nature reported by only small numbers of patients. Changes  in biochemical parameters have been common, including decreases in plasma sodium  and potassium levels and increases in plasma creatinine and uric acid levels.  These changes are typical of loop diuretics. No changes were clinically  significant nor were clinically relevant changes noted in glucose metabolism,  cholesterol or triglyceride levels or in haematological values. Thus, torasemide  is an interesting new loop diuretic with potential use in the treatment of mild  to moderate essential hypertension and of oedematous states in which diuretic  therapy is warranted. Preliminary studies suggest it to be as efficacious as  other diuretics in common use and to have some advantage over furosemide in  duration of action and in effects on potassium and calcium. However, further long  term trials in larger groups of patients are needed to delineate the place of  torasemide in therapy fully, both as a single agent and in combination with other  currently accepted drug regimens.","1991-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:31","","81-103","","1","41","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1706990","","","","*Diuretics/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Sulfonamides/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Animals; Half-Life; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Kidney/drug effects; Tissue Distribution; Torsemide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vitro drug dissolution studies were performed using an exchange cell and drug  release was measured by UV spectroscopy at 272 nm using distilled water. The  dissolution profiles of hydrochlorothiazide from the wafers and films were  compared by determining the rates of drug release, estimated from the % release  versus time profiles and calculating their difference (f(1)) and similarity  (f(2)) factors. The effects of drug loading, polymer content and amount of  glycerol (GLY) (films) on the drug release characteristics of both formulations  were investigated. Both the wafers and films showed sustained type release  profiles that were best explained by the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. Changes in  the concentration of drug and GLY (films) did not significantly alter the release  profiles whilst increasing polymer content significantly decreased the rate of  drug release from both formulations. The rate of release was faster from the  wafers than the corresponding films which could be attributed to differences in  the physical microstructure.

Plasma protein binding of ketanserin amounted to 95.1% in healthy  subjects, 88.1% in dogs and 98.8% in rats. Its blood to plasma concentration  ratio was 0.70 in humans, 0.78 in dogs and 0.65 in rats. Plasma protein binding  of ketanserin-ol, the main plasma metabolite of ketanserin, was 81.2% in humans  and its blood to plasma concentration ratio was 1.04. The plasma protein binding  of both ketanserin and ketanserin-ol was highly dependent on pH. Albumin was by  far the main binding protein for ketanserin in human plasma and binding was  independent of the ketanserin concentration within a very wide range. Plasma  protein binding of ketanserin in elderly hypertensive patients was not  significantly different from that in healthy adults. In chronic renal failure  patients, whether on haemodialysis or not, the free ketanserin fraction was 40%  higher than in healthy subjects. High therapeutic levels of ketanserin (0.25  microgram/ml) did not influence the plasma protein binding of diphenylhydantoin,  hydrochlorothiazide, imipramine, ketoconazole, propranolol or warfarin. Out of 12  drugs, only tolbutamide at therapeutic concentrations decreased significantly the  plasma protein binding of ketanserin.

Both  aqueous and solid phases were analysed for the presence of 31 pharmaceuticals  included in the analytical method. The most ubiquitous contaminants in the sewage  water were analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen (14.6-31.3 microg/L)  and acetaminophen (7.1-11.4 microg/L), antibiotic ofloxacin (0.89-31.7 microg/L),  lipid regulators gemfibrozil (2.0-5.9 microg/L) and bezafibrate (1.9-29.8  microg/L), beta-blocker atenolol (0.84-2.8 microg/L), hypoglycaemic agent  glibenclamide (0.12-15.9 microg/L) and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (2.3-4.8  microg/L). Also, several pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen,  diclofenac, ofloxacin and azithromycin were detected in sewage sludge at  concentrations up to 741.1, 336.3, 380.7, 454.7 and 299.6 ng/g dry weight. Two  pilot-scale MBRs exhibited enhanced elimination of several pharmaceutical  residues poorly removed by the CAS treatment (e.g., mefenamic acid, indomethacin,  diclofenac, propyphenazone, pravastatin, gemfibrozil), whereas in some cases more  stable operation of one of the MBR reactors at prolonged SRT proved to be  detrimental for the elimination of some compounds (e.g., beta-blockers,  ranitidine, famotidine, erythromycin). Moreover, the anti-epileptic drug  carbamazepine and diuretic hydrochlorothiazide by-passed all three treatments  investigated. Furthermore, sorption to sewage sludge in the MBRs as well as in  the entire treatment line of a full-scale WWTP is discussed for the encountered  analytes. Among the pharmaceuticals encountered in sewage sludge, sorption to  sludge could be a relevant removal pathway only for several compounds (i.e.,  mefenamic acid, propranolol, and loratidine). Especially in the case of  loratidine the experimentally determined sorption coefficients (Kds) were in the  range 2214-3321 L/kg (mean). The results obtained for the solid phase indicated  that MBR wastewater treatment yielding higher biodegradation rate could reduce  the load of pollutants in the sludge. Also, the overall output load in the  aqueous and solid phase of the investigated WWTP was calculated, indicating that  none of the residual pharmaceuticals initially detected in the sewage sludge were  degraded during the anaerobic digestion. Out of the 26 pharmaceutical residues  passing through the WWTP, 20 were ultimately detected in the treated sludge that  is further applied on farmland.","2009-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:35:01","","831-841","","3","43","","Water Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19091371","","","","*Bioreactors; *Membranes, Artificial; *Waste Disposal, Fluid; Absorption; Biomass; Kinetics; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*isolation & purification; Sewage/*chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/*isolation & purification; Water Purification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplement","","0803-8023","10.1080/080370501750275857","","The six major classes of antihypertensive agents prescribed worldwide are similar in efficacy but dissimilar in tolerability. Recently, the World Health  Organization-International Society of Hypertension (WHO-ISH) concluded that  agents from all six classes are suitable for the initiation and maintenance of  antihypertensive therapy, including the newest class of agents, the angiotensin  II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs). The ideal antihypertensive agent should be  effective and well tolerated, as well as synergistic in blood pressure-lowering  effects when combined with other agents. As monotherapy, AIIRAs have demonstrated  efficacy similar to other classes of antihypertensive agents in numerous clinical  trials. Several AIIRAs have also demonstrated enhanced efficacy when combined  with a low dose of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). A well-known feature  of this new class of agents is placebo-level tolerability; however, less is known  about intra-class differences. Losartan, the first approved AIIRA, has become an  important benchmark for within-class comparisons with respect to antihypertensive  efficacy. Head-to-head comparisons between losartan and newer AIIRAs have been  conducted; their cumulative results indicate that the antihypertensive effect and  antagonistic activity of losartan may be the weakest among AIIRAs. In a recent  clinical trial, we demonstrated that irbesartan produces statistically superior  blood pressure reduction when compared to valsartan. This may have clinical  implications for agent selection among the AIIRAs.","2001","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:30:26","","19-24","","","2","","Blood Press Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Sweden PMID: 11465913","","","","*Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Drug Synergism; Humans; Hypertension/complications/drug therapy; Therapeutic Equivalency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Localization and characterization of chloride absorption.","The American journal of physiology","","0002-9513","10.1152/ajpregu.1990.258.2.R398","","Single tubules, dissected from the peritubular sheath of the dorsal bundle zone of kidney of the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias, were perfused in vitro at  17-18 degrees C. This segment is the largest of the five in the peritubular  sheath and had average inner and outer diameters of 46.9 +/- 1.2 and 74.4 +/- 2.1  microns, respectively (n = 32). These values suggest that this is the  intermediate IV segment. When perfused with symmetrical buffered elasmobranch  saline, intermediate IV segments exhibited high rates of Cl- absorption (JCl,  pmol.s-1.cm-2): 1,696 at an average perfusion rate (Vo) of 8.2 nl/min. Cl-  absorption was highly flow dependent [1/JCl = 57.95(1/Vo) + 1.75; r = 0.71, P  less than 0.01]. Maximal rates of Cl-absorption, calculated from reciprocal  transformation of the flow dependence of JCl, yielded a value of 5,714  pmol.s-1.cm-2. In the presence of a 200-mosmol/kg transepithelial osmotic  gradient, fluid absorption was negligible. The spontaneous transepithelial  voltage (Vte, mucosal with respect to serosal compartment) averaged 8.0 +/- 1.0  mV (n = 26). Such active transport of Cl- in the absence of fluid movement and in  the presence of a lumen-positive transepithelial voltage is characteristic of  amphibian and mammalian diluting segments. Na(+)-to-Cl- permeability ratios  (PNa/PCl) averaged 2.5 +/- 0.5, indicating that, as in mammalian thick ascending  limbs, this segment is Na+ (cation) permselective. Vte was dependent on the  presence of Na+ and Cl- in the external solutions and was reversibly abolished by  isosmotic replacement with N-methyl-D-glucamine or with isethionate,  respectively. Ouabain inhibited Vte but was not reversible within the time course  of these experiments. Furosemide (10(-4) M), but not equimolar concentrations of  amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide, added to the luminal perfusate inhibited both  Vte and JCl. These results suggest that apical membrane Na+ entry in intermediate  IV segments is mediated by Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport and is consistent with the  existence of a functional role of urinary dilution in the reabsorption of urea in  the elasmobranch kidney.","1990-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:33","","R398-408","","2 Pt 2","258","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2155546","","","","Absorption; Animals; Body Fluids/metabolism; Chlorides/*metabolism; Cyclic AMP/pharmacology; Diuretics/pharmacology; Dogfish/*metabolism; Electrophysiology; In Vitro Techniques; Kidney Tubules/anatomy & histology/*metabolism/physiology; Osmosis; Ouabain/pharmacology; Permeability; Sharks/*metabolism; Tissue Distribution; Water/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Successful therapy not only needs to be effective,  it also needs to be well tolerated. Angiotensin receptor blockers have emerged as  a major therapeutic class because they meet both of these requirements. Numerous  studies indicate that all approved angiotensin receptor blockers are highly  selective for angiotensin-1 receptors, lower blood pressure as monotherapies, and  work well in combination with other drugs - particularly diuretics. The  side-effect profile of angiotensin receptor blockers is similar to that of  placebo and they have not been associated with known side effects of  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as cough and angioneurotic edema.  Candesartan cilexetil is an angiotensin receptor blocker with insurmountable  binding properties to the angiotensin-1 receptor, long duration of action and  improved efficacy. In patients with hypertension, candesartan monotherapy has  been shown to be safe and effective. Comparative data have shown similar or  better results to other monotherapies in blood-pressure control, and in  combination with hydrochlorothiazide it has been shown to have additive or  synergistic effects. More recent data demonstrate that candesartan cilexetil is  useful in the treatment of patients with heart failure and may protect against  diabetic nephropathy. Studies have also shown protection from stroke,  particularly in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.","2004-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:36:03","","829-835","","6","2","","Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15500428","","","","Adult; Aged; Benzimidazoles/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Biological Availability; Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Cardiovascular Diseases/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Hypertension/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality; Male; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Tetrazoles/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fimasartan is a derivative of losartan in which the  imidazole ring has been replaced. It provides a selective type 1 angiotensin II  receptor antagonist effect with noncompetitive, in surmountable binding.  Fimasartan is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with an oral  bioavailability of 18.6 ± 7.2%. Fimasartan is relatively stable in terms of  metabolism and more than 90% of circulating fimasartan moieties in the plasma are  in the parent form; fecal elimination and biliary excretion are the predominant  elimination pathways of fimasartan. Areas covered: We reviewed data from clinical  trials that investigated safety and efficacy of fimasartan in hypertension.  Expert opinion: Fimasartan proved good efficacy in blood pressure reduction. In  large clinical studies,fimasartan showed an excellent safety profile and when  combined with hydrochlorothiazide oram lodipine, it showed a better effect on  controlling blood pressure than monotherapy. Fimasartan 60-120 mg once daily has  also shown an antihypertensive effect over 24-h. Moreover, preclinical studies  demonstrated organ-protecting effects of fimasartan. These results make  fimasartan an attractive candidate for the treatment of hypertension.

SCH 33844 diacid inhibited hydrolysis of hip-his-leu by  rabbit lung ACE in a potent (Ki = 0.74 nM), selective, and noncompetitive  fashion. SCH 33844 (0.03-1 mg/kg p.o.) produced dose-related inhibition of  angiotensin I (AI) pressor responses in conscious rats with a duration of 24 h at  the higher dose. SCH 33844 (0.3-30 mg/kg p.o.) reduced blood pressure in a  dose-related manner in conscious SHR with a 24-h duration. Antihypertensive  activity was enhanced in the presence of hydrochlorothiazide.

Many patients achieve an adequate blood pressure reduction with  lisinopril alone, and in those who do not, most will with the addition of  hydrochlorothiazide; lisinopril also attenuates hypokalaemia induced by thiazide  diuretics. In patients with congestive heart failure resistant to conventional  therapy, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg once daily improved indices of cardiac function  and appeared to produce greater benefit than captopril in one controlled study.  Lisinopril is well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported.  Thus, lisinopril is a suitable treatment for essential hypertension and shows  promise in the treatment of congestive heart failure.

Recent  therapeutic trials confirm that the efficacy of isradipine in the treatment of  patients with mainly mild to moderate hypertension, when administered orally as a  conventional or modified release preparation, is similar to that of titrated  dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa,  metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood  pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another  antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to  monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective  in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and  that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and  hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when  administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine  Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of  isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of carotid  artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early  atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased significantly  less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of therapy.  Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder of the  3-year trial. The confirmation of its antihypertensive efficacy, along with its  favourable haemodynamic profile and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy,  minimal effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, preservation of quality of life  and good tolerability, makes isradipine a suitable drug for the treatment of most  patients with mild to moderate hypertension.","1995-04","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:29:56","","618-649","","4","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7789292","","","","Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hemodynamics/*drug effects; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy/etiology; Isradipine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Postoperative Complications/drug therapy; Pregnancy; Renal Circulation/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trandolaprilat  inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and displays similar  pharmacodynamic properties to other ACE inhibitors, improving haemodynamic and  cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension. Trandolapril 2 to 4mg  once daily effectively controls blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients  with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative  trials, trandolapril had similar antihypertensive efficacy to that of atenolol,  enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and sustained release nifedipine, but  was more effective than captopril. Combined therapy with trandolapril and  hydrochlorothiazide or sustained release nifedipine had a significantly greater  antihypertensive effect than either drug treatment alone. Further comparative  trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. The tolerability  profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, most adverse  events being generally mild and transient in nature, and trandolapril lacks  adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, trandolapril, with  its favourable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to  that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate  hypertension, is likely to provide a well tolerated option for the treatment of  this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine  its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients following myocardial  infarction.","1994-07","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:46:16","","71-90","","1","48","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7525196","","","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Tolerance; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Indoles/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Multicenter Studies as Topic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current formulations contain blood pressure-lowering drugs  and others, such statins or acetylsalicylic acid. These drugs exhibit different  physical chemical features, and consequently different release kinetics.  Therefore, the concentration in plasma of some of them after the release process  can be out of the therapeutic range. This paper investigates a new methodology  for the control dosage of a polypill recently reported containing  hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, losartan and simvastatin in a 12.5/2.5/25/40  weight ratio. The procedure is based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN)  with MCM-41 structure (MSN-41) used as carrier, aimed to control release of the  four drugs included in the polypill. In vitro release data were obtained by HPLC  and the curves adjusted with a kinetic model. To explain the release results, a  molecular model was built to determine the drug-matrix interactions, and quantum  mechanical calculations were performed to obtain the electrostatic properties of  each drug. Amlodipine, losartan and simvastatin were released from the  polypill-MSN-41 system in a controlled way. This would be a favourable behavior  when used clinically because avoid too quick pressure decrease. However, the  diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was quickly released from our system in the first  minutes, as is needed in hypertensive urgencies. In addition, an increase in the  stability of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in the polypill-MSN-41  system. Therefore, the new way of polypill dosage proposed can result in a safer  and effective treatment.","2017-01-15","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:20:31","","1-8","","","97","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It may interfere not only with tablet disintegration, drug dissolution and drug transit  through the gastrointestinal tract, but may also affect the metabolic  transformation of drugs in the gastrointestinal wall and in the liver. Different  food components can have different effects, and food may interact in opposite  ways, even with drugs that are chemically related. Therefore, the net effect of  food on drug bioavailability can be predicted only by direct clinical studies of  the drug in question. As judged mainly from single meal, single dose studies,  food intake enhances the bioavailability of several different drugs, such as  propranolol, metoprolol, hydrallazine, hydrochlorothiazide, canrenone (from  spironolactone), nitrofurantoin, erythromycin (stearate), dicoumarol, phenytoin  and carbamazepine, but reduces that of drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin,  tetracycline, penicillin and ampicillin, while having no consistent effect on the  bioavailability of metronidazole, oxazepam, melperone, propylthiouracil,  sulphasomidine and sulphonylureas. For some drugs such as digoxin and  paracetamol, the rate but not the extent of absorption is reduced. Food may  enhance bioavailability even though, or rather because, the rate of gastric  emptying is reduced; this is apparently the case with hydrochlorothiazide and  nitrofurantoin. The food induced enhancement of bioavailability of propranolol,  metoprolol and hydrallazine is probably due to reduced first pass metabolism of  these drugs, while food induced improvement of drug dissolution may explain the  enhanced bioavailability of carbamazepine, canrenone, dicoumarol and phenytoin.  An increased gastrointestinal pH may be in part the cause of the food induced  reduction of the bioavailability of drugs such as isoniazid and tetracycline. In  addition to single meal effects, repeated intake of protein-rich meals enhance,  while carbohydrate-rich meals reduce, the rate of oxidation of antipyrine and  theophylline. Moreover, intake of charcoal broiled meat markedly accelerates the  oxidation of phenacetin and variably accelerates elimination of theophylline.  Thus, food and its components and contaminants may have both short and long term  effects on both the absorptive and biotransformation processes influencing  systemic availability of drugs.","1978-10","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:31:31","","337-351","","5","3","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 81118","","","","*Food; Analgesics/metabolism; Animals; Anti-Anxiety Agents/metabolism; Anti-Infective Agents/metabolism; Anticoagulants/metabolism; Anticonvulsants/metabolism; Antidepressive Agents/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/metabolism; Antipsychotic Agents/metabolism; Antithyroid Agents/metabolism; Biological Availability; Bronchodilator Agents/metabolism; Digitalis Glycosides/metabolism; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives/metabolism; Hypoglycemic Agents/metabolism; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short to medium term clinical trials indicate that amlodipine is effective as  both an antianginal agent in patients with stable angina pectoris and an  antihypertensive agent in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In small  comparative studies amlodipine was at least as effective as 'standard' agents,  including atenolol, verapamil, hydrochlorothiazide or captopril in hypertension,  and diltiazem or nadolol in angina pectoris. Amlodipine is well tolerated, and  does not appear to cause some of the undesirable effects often associated with  other cardiovascular agents (e.g. adverse changes in serum lipid patterns,  cardiac conduction disturbances, postural hypotension). The most common adverse  effects associated with amlodipine therapy--oedema and flushing--are related to  the vasodilatory action of the drug, and are generally mild to moderate in  severity. Thus, amlodipine seems to provide a useful alternative to other agents  currently available for the treatment of essential hypertension and chronic  stable angina pectoris, with certain pharmacodynamic and tolerability properties  that should be advantageous in many patients.","1991-03","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:32:20","","478-505","","3","41","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1711448","","","","Amlodipine; Animals; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy; Humans; Nifedipine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic efficacy.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199345020-00006","","Carvedilol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which also causes peripheral vasodilation primarily via alpha 1-adrenergic blockade. Carvedilol produces its  antihypertensive effect partly by reducing total peripheral resistance by  blocking alpha 1-adrenoceptors and by preventing beta-adrenoceptor-mediated  compensatory mechanisms. This combined action avoids many of the unwanted effects  associated with traditional beta-blocker or vasodilator therapy. In clinical  trials published to date, most of which enrolled small numbers of patients, the  antihypertensive efficacy of carvedilol administered once daily was similar to  that of atenolol, labetalol, pindolol, propranolol, metoprolol, nitrendipine (in  elderly patients), slow release nifedipine or captopril in patients with  mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Combined therapy with carvedilol 25 mg  and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, nicardipine 60 mg or slow release nifedipine 20 mg  has an additive antihypertensive effect. Carvedilol and atenolol at similar doses  were equally effective at reducing blood pressure in patients who had previously  not responded adequately to hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. As a result of its  multiple mechanisms of action, carvedilol is suited for the management of  specific groups of hypertensive patients, such as those with renal impairment. In  patients with non-insulin-dependent or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  carvedilol does not appear to affect glucose tolerance or carbohydrate  metabolism. Initial studies have demonstrated that carvedilol and slow release  nifedipine have similar efficacy in patients with stable angina pectoris and  there is evidence that carvedilol has a beneficial haemodynamic effect in  patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA class II or III) secondary to  ischaemic heart disease. A postmarketing surveillance study has shown that  carvedilol is generally well tolerated with only 7% (164/2226) of patients (83%  of the total number received 25mg daily for 12 weeks) withdrawing from treatment  because of adverse events. Vertigo, headache, bronchospasm, fatigue and skin  reactions were the most common events causing withdrawal. Thus, clinical  experience to date suggests that carvedilol is likely to be a valuable addition  to the options currently available for treating patients with mild-to-moderate  essential hypertension, and may offer particular benefit in specific populations  of hypertensive patients.","1993-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:31:14","","232-258","","2","45","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7681374","","","","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/*therapeutic use; Angina Pectoris/drug therapy; Animals; Carbazoles/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Carvedilol; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Propanolamines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Vasodilator Agents/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with nifedipine, the  prototype of the dihydropyridines, nilvadipine has a longer duration of action.  The antihypertensive efficacy of nilvadipine appears to be comparable with that  of nicardipine and nitrendipine, enalapril and captopril and  hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene, although further clinical experience is required  to establish the claimed advantages nilvadipine may have over the other  dihydropyridine derivatives currently used to treat hypertension. Preliminary  studies suggest that nilvadipine may also be useful in the treatment of patients  with stable exertional or variant angina. Studies conducted in Japan indicate  that nilvadipine improves symptoms resulting from cerebral infarction in some  patients, but further comparative studies are required to confirm these results.  The tolerability of nilvadipine appears to be comparable with that of nicardipine  and better than that of nifedipine with respect to flushes, oedema and liver  function abnormalities. As is typical of calcium antagonists, there is no  evidence of tolerance to the antihypertensive effects of nilvadipine. The drug is  equally effective in treating hypertension in elderly and younger patients and  does not appear to adversely affect glucose or lipid metabolism. Thus, provided  its apparently good tolerability is confirmed by wider clinical experience, it  should be a suitable alternative to other calcium antagonists when used alone or  in conjunction with other drugs for the majority of patients with mild to  moderate hypertension.","1995-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:29:52","","150-171","","2","6","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7711361","","","","Aging/metabolism; Angina Pectoris/*drug therapy; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Cerebrovascular Disorders/*drug therapy; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Nifedipine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A.","Angiotensin II receptor antagonists: the prototype losartan.","The Annals of pharmacotherapy","","1060-0280","10.1177/106002809603000611","","OBJECTIVE: To describe a new class of antihypertensive agents, the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, with emphasis on the prototype losartan. Pharmacokinetic  data and clinical trials are reviewed, as well as adverse reactions, drug  interactions, and dosing guidelines. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of  English-language literature published from 1966 through 1995 was performed. In  addition, Merck and Co. provided bibliographic data on file for losartan. STUDY  SELECTION: Emphasis was placed on clinical and pharmacokinetic studies in humans.  Controlled, double-blind studies were evaluated to assess the efficacy and  adverse effect profile of losartan. DATA SYNTHESIS: Losartan is a nonpeptide,  competitive antagonist of the type I angiotensin II receptor. In comparative  clinical trials, losartan appears to have antihypertensive efficacy similar to  that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Losartan is well  tolerated, with an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo and a  reduced incidence of cough versus that with ACE inhibitors. A combination product  consisting of losartan 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg has also received  approval for the treatment of hypertension. The combination product is not  indicated for initial therapy, but is recommended for patients who do not respond  adequately to losartan monotherapy. The angiotensin II receptor antagonists are  also being investigated for beneficial effects in patients with ventricular  hypertrophy, renal disease, and heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Losartan, the first  angiotensin II receptor antagonist to receive approval for use in the US, appears  to be an effective new antihypertensive agent with an adverse effect profile  similar to that of placebo. Losartan may be an alternative for patients who  cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. However, the effect of losartan on mortality  remains to be evaluated. The role of the angiotensin II receptor antagonists in  areas such as ventricular hypertrophy, renal function, and heart failure has yet  to be determined.","1996-06","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:36:49","","625-636","","6","30","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8792950","","","","*Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin II/*metabolism; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Imidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Losartan; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Tetrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ibopamine acts  predominantly as a vasodilator and inhibitor of neuroendocrine activation in  congestive heart failure, but also has mild positive inotropic effects at higher  doses. The beneficial effects on cardiac and systemic haemodynamic parameters  seen in short term studies have been maintained in predominantly noncomparative  trials for up to 1 year, and improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA)  functional class and clinical symptoms have been observed in patients with  congestive heart failure of varying severity. In double-blind studies conducted  in small numbers of patients, the efficacy of ibopamine was comparable to that of  digoxin, captopril, enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Ibopamine can successfully  replace treatment with intravenous dopamine in patients with severe heart  failure, and is effective and well tolerated when administered in combination  with digoxin, diuretics and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  Ibopamine has shown no detrimental effects on renal function, few adverse effects  on neurohormonal parameters and has demonstrated no significant proarrhythmic  properties at therapeutic doses in patients with congestive heart failure. No  adverse metabolic effects were observed during ibopamine therapy in patients with  diabetes mellitus, nor did ibopamine have detrimental effects in patients with  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While reliable evidence is required  concerning effects on mortality before the role of ibopamine can be clearly  defined, the drug appears to be a useful agent for combination with conventional  therapies in treating patients with mild to severe congestive heart failure.","1993-12","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:42:59","","556-584","","6","3","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7906158","","","","Aged; Deoxyepinephrine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Dopamine Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Humans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes of rubidium uptake were interpreted to reflect altered sodium  entry and basolateral Na-K-ATPase activity. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide,  amiloride and furosemide were determined in saline-loaded animals.  Hydrochlorothiazide inhibited rubidium uptake in proximal convoluted and distal  convoluted tubule cells. The effect was largest in distal convoluted tubule  cells. Amiloride reduced rubidium uptake in principal cells as well as in  proximal convoluted, distal convoluted and connecting tubule cells. Furosemide  depressed rubidium uptake in distal convoluted tubule cells, but increased uptake  in principal cells.

In patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, titrated low  doses of captopril used alone or in conjunction with a diuretic are similar in  efficacy to usual doses of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or  beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, as well as to the other ACE inhibitors. In  addition, captopril improved well-being to a greater extent than methyldopa or  propranolol in a study designed specifically to determine the effect of treatment  on the quality of life of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension.  The earlier demonstrated efficacy of captopril, used with a diuretic and often  also with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, in the treatment of severe  hypertension refractory to conventional 'triple therapy' has been confirmed in  more recent trials which illustrate the generally marked antihypertensive effect  of captopril-containing regimens in such patients. Results of initial trials in  patients with scleroderma are promising, with control of hypertension and  stabilization of renal function in these patients when treated at an early stage  of the disease. Several comparative and long term trials of captopril in patients  with chronic congestive heart failure refractory to treatment with a  diuretic/digitalis regimen clearly demonstrate that initial haemodynamic  improvement is maintained and correlates with clinical benefit. A tendency for  overall clinical response to captopril to be better than the response to  prazosin, hydralazine, nisoldipine or enalapril has been reported. Results of a  multicentre comparison with digoxin and placebo indicate that captopril is a  suitable alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate heart failure  who are receiving maintenance diuretic therapy. The tolerability of captopril has  now been studied in many thousands of patients involved in formalized trials and  the early impression of poor tolerability can no longer be justified. The use of  generally lower dosages of captopril in patients with normal or slightly impaired  renal function has resulted in a generally low incidence of rash (0.5 to 4%),  dysgeusia (0.1 to 3%), proteinuria (0.5%), neutropenia (0.3% during first 3  months) and symptomatic hypotension (0.1 to 3%).

Because hypertension is associated with numerous vascular  complications whose incidences are not always lowered once blood pressure is  regulated, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of five selected  diuretics on capillary permeability to see if they could contribute in some way  to these vascular abnormalities. Extravasation of Evans blue dye (EB: 20 mg/kg)  injected in the caudal vein of male Wistar rats was used to assess capillary  permeability to albumin. Indapamide (0.04 mg/kg), cicletanine (2.0 mg/kg),  amiloride (0.3 mg/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (0.5 mg/kg) and furosemide (0.5 mg/kg)  were administered by acute i.v. injection or by 10-day ""chronic"" gavage.

Experience with torasemide.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199100413-00009","","Diuretics belong to the class of antihypertensive drugs recommended for first-line therapy of essential hypertension. Although they are widely and  effectively used for the treatment of hypertension, the question remains whether  their possible negative influence on metabolic and electrolyte parameters could  partly offset the benefit of blood pressure reduction with respect to reduction  of coronary artery disease. Recently published data demonstrate that much lower  doses of thiazides exert the same antihypertensive effect as the higher doses  used in the past and even prescribed today. These lower doses produce relatively  little change in biochemical parameters. Thus, the postulated risks can be  avoided by using the lowest effective dose. Traditionally, loop diuretics of the  furosemide (frusemide) type are rarely used as first-line antihypertensive  agents. They seem to display less efficacy coupled with an intense diuresis when  used in standard available doses. However, there is evidence that newly developed  loop diuretics, in lower doses than used in congestive heart failure, are  effective antihypertensive agents. For example, torasemide 2.5mg once daily,  which does not exert a significant diuresis over 24 hours compared with placebo,  lowers elevated blood pressure to a similar extent than thiazides or related  compounds. This antihypertensive effect is accompanied by less, if any, changes  in metabolic or electrolyte parameters compared with widely used standard  diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide or chlorthalidone. The  influence on serum potassium and magnesium is similar to or even less than fixed  combinations of hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene or amiloride. Thus, low-dose  torasemide constitutes an alternative to established thiazide antihypertensive  therapy.","1991","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:25:55","","80-91","","","41 Suppl 3","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1712717","","","","Diuretics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Sulfonamides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Torsemide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES:  Reference citations were sought from Index Medicus and Science Citation Index.  Data were collected from abstracts and articles describing experimental studies  or blind clinical trials. STUDY SELECTION: Studies designed in a randomized,  blind, and placebo-controlled manner were emphasized. Studies also were included  if bisoprolol was evaluated comparatively with other agents in a randomized,  blind fashion. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from human studies published in English were  evaluated. Studies were assessed by sample size and the clarity of descriptions  of methods and results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bisoprolol reduces systolic and diastolic  blood pressures in patients with hypertension for a 24-hour dosing interval and  is associated with beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with myocardial  ischemia. It is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and  membrane-stabilizing effects at therapeutic dosages. In patients with  hypertension, bisoprolol diminishes plasma renin activity, platelet aggregation,  effective renal plasma flow, and creatinine clearance. Bisoprolol has minimal  effects on glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profiles. Monotherapy with  bisoprolol is as effective as with atenolol, nitrendipine, or nifedipine.  Low-dose combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide is at least as effective as  either bisoprolol or hydrochlorothiazide alone. Preliminary experience in the  management of angina pectoris suggests that bisoprolol is at least as efficacious  as atenolol or verapamil. Thus far, reported adverse effects are similar to those  of other beta-blockers.

N-dipropyl substitution to  yield probenecid or ring-substitution to yield furosemide and piretanide augment  the inhibitory potency. However, hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide exert only  a moderate inhibitory potency. Succinate transport was inhibited by furosemide  only. Sulfate transport was inhibited by furosemide and  3-sulfamoyl-4-phenoxybenzoate as well as by probenecid, piretanide,  hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide. 2.) Phenoxyacetate, -propionate, and  -butyrate exert increasing inhibition against PAH transport. The weed-killers  2,4-dichloro-, and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4 D and 2,4,5 T) had a  similar inhibitory potency, while ethacrynic acid showed a lower and the  uricosuric tienilic acid a higher inhibitory potency.

Generally, most excipients had no influence on drug permeability.  With the exception of sodium lauryl sulfate, no excipient affected Caco-2  monolayer integrity. Sodium lauryl sulfate moderately increased the permeability  of almost all the drugs.

It lowers peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.  Enalapril 10 to 40 mg/day administered either once or twice daily is effective in  lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension,  and shows similar efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide,  beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and captopril. Most patients  achieve adequate blood pressure control on enalapril alone or with  hydrochlorothiazide. In patients with severe congestive heart failure resistant  to conventional therapy, enalapril improves cardiac performance by a reduction in  both preload and afterload, and improves clinical status long term. Enalapril  appears to be well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported. It  does not induce the bradycardia associated with beta-blockers or the adverse  effects of diuretics on some laboratory values. In fact, the hypokalaemic effect  of hydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the addition of enalapril. The incidence  of the main (but rare) side effects of hypotension in hypovolaemic patients and  reduced renal function in certain patients with renovascular hypertension, which  are also seen with captopril, might be reduced by careful dosage titration,  discontinuation of diuretics, and monitoring of at-risk patients. Thus, enalapril  is a particularly worthwhile addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium, as  an alternative for treatment of all grades of essential and renovascular  hypertension.

To test whether  this increase correlated with increased thiazide sensitivity (NCC activity) and  blood pressure, and could be modified by insulin-sensitizing agents, we treated  lean and obese Zucker rats (9 wk old) with either a control diet or this diet  supplemented with 3 mg/kg body wt rosiglitazone (RGZ), a peroxisomal  proliferator-activated receptor subtype gamma agonist and potent  insulin-sensitizing agent, for 12 wk (n = 9/group). The rise in blood pressure,  measured continuously by radiotelemetry, was significantly blunted in the  RGZ-treated obese rats. Similarly, blood glucose and urinary albumin were  markedly decreased in these rats. RGZ-treated rats whether lean or obese excreted  a NaCl load faster but excreted less sodium in response to hydrochlorothiazide,  applied as a novel in vivo measure of NCC activity. Obese rats had increased  renal protein abundance and urinary excretion of NCC; however, this was not  significantly reduced by RGZ (densitometry in cortex homogenate - %lean control):  100 +/- 9, 93 +/- 4, 124 +/- 9, and 141 +/- 14 for lean control, lean RGZ, obese  control, and obese RGZ, respectively. Subcellular localization, as evaluated by  confocal microscopy and immunoblotting following differential centrifugation, of  NCC was not different between rat groups.

Cl⁻  absorption was measured in CCDs perfused in vitro that were taken from  aldosterone-treated mice. Administration of an NO donor (10 μM MAHMA NONOate)  reduced JCl and transepithelial voltage (VT) both in the presence or absence of  angiotensin II. However, reducing endogenous NO production by inhibiting NO  synthase (100 μM N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) increased JCl only in the  presence of angiotensin II, suggesting that angiotensin II stimulates NO synthase  activity. To determine the transport process that mediates NO-sensitive changes  in JCl, we examined the effect of NO on JCl following either genetic ablation or  chemical inhibition of transporters in the CCD. Since the application of  hydrochlorothiazide (100 μM) or bafilomycin (5 nM) to the perfusate or ablation  of the gene encoding pendrin did not alter NO-sensitive JCl, NO modulates JCl  independent of the Na⁺-dependent Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger (NDCBE, Slc4a8), the A cell  apical plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase and pendrin. In contrast, both total and  NO-sensitive JCl and VT were abolished with application of an epithelial Na(+)  channel (ENaC) inhibitor (3 μM benzamil) to the perfusate.

The objective of this study was to  determine whether thiazides hyperpolarize Vbl by reducing intracellular Cl-  activity (Acl). To this end, distal tubules were perfused in vitro, and  electrophysiological techniques were used to measure Acl and Vbl.  Hydrochlorothiazide in tubular fluid reduced ACl from 17.0 to 12.6 mM and  hyperpolarized Vbl by 16 mV.

Because a  previous study suggested that electroneutral NaCl reabsorption is mediated by  Na+/H(+)-Cl-/HCO3- exchangers in the apical membrane, the Cl-/HCO3- exchange  inhibitor, 4,4-diisothiocyanostilbene-2-2-disulphonic acid (DIDS) was added to  tubule fluid. DIDS reduced Acl from 15.0 to 11.6 and hyperpolarized Vbl by 10 mV.  DIDS and hydrochlorothiazide were not additive, inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by  amiloride (10(-3) M) and Na+ replacement with N-methyl-D-glucamine also reduced  Acl from 17.4 to 12.9 and hyperpolarized Vbl by 16 mV.

This finding highlights the need for new treatment strategies that are  sufficiently effective throughout the dosing interval, well tolerated, and  available in a convenient, once-daily regimen. Monotherapy with any individual  drug class is often unable to fulfil all of these criteria in more than a  minority of patients. In contrast, once-daily therapy with rational combinations  of antihypertensive drugs offers a promising approach to improving treatment of  hypertension. The highly vascular selective calcium antagonist felodipine and the  cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol have complementary mechanisms of action,  making them appropriate for use together in the management of hypertension. A new  extended-release (ER) formulation, combining felodipine, 5 mg, and metoprolol, 50  mg*, has therefore been developed. This formulation has been shown to provide  significantly greater reductions and higher antihypertensive response rates than  either agent used alone. This high efficacy is achieved with maintained good  tolerability. In comparative trials, felodipine-metoprolol has also been shown to  be more effective than combination treatment with nifedipine and atenolol, or  captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

Why it happens and what to do about it.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-198530050-00003","","Resistance to loop diuretics is often encountered clinically. Studies in healthy subjects have shown that overall response to loop diuretics depends upon the  interplay between the total amount of drug reaching the urine, the time course of  its entry into urine and the pharmacodynamics of response to diuretic in the  urine. The mechanism by which diuretic resistance occurs has been elucidated in  several clinical conditions. Treatment with inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis  has no effect on diuretic appearance in urine but blunts response by blocking the  increase in renal blood flow produced by loop diuretics. In the elderly and in  patients with moderate renal insufficiency, the mechanism of resistance appears  to be purely pharmacokinetic, involving altered access of diuretic into the  urine. In contrast, patients with nephrotic syndrome and hepatic cirrhosis  manifest a purely pharmacodynamic form of resistance: in nephrosis, diuretic may  bind to protein in the urine; in cirrhosis the mechanism of resistance is  unclear. Lastly, in patients with congestive heart failure, with intravenous  administration, resistance represents a pharmacodynamic phenomenon. With oral  administration, however, the time course but not the extent of absorption is  altered; consequently, in this setting, both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  changes may contribute to the subnormal response. Strategies for overcoming  resistance to loop diuretics in patients receiving NSAIDs or those with renal  disease, hepatic cirrhosis or congestive heart failure include one or more of:  increasing the dose size; administering frequent 'small' (but effective) doses;  continuous intravenous infusion of the diuretic; or concomitant administration of  another diuretic such as metolazone or hydrochlorothiazide.","1985-11","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:29:40","","427-443","","5","30","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3905337","","","","Anti-Inflammatory Agents/adverse effects; Diet, Sodium-Restricted; Diuretics/*therapeutic use; Drug Interactions; Drug Resistance; Furosemide/therapeutic use/urine; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Humans; Kidney Diseases/drug therapy; Liver Cirrhosis/drug therapy; Loop of Henle/drug effects; Nephrotic Syndrome/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the first of a new class of drugs to be introduced for clinical  use in hypertension. This novel agent binds competitively and selectively to the  AII subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor, thereby blocking AII-induced physiological  effects. An active metabolite, E3174, contributes substantially to its  antihypertensive effect, which persists throughout 24 hours after once-daily  administration. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, losartan  potassium 50 to 100mg once daily as monotherapy lowers blood pressure to a  similar degree to enalapril, atenolol and felodipine extended release (ER).  Losartan potassium combined with hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure  further than either drug given separately. About one-third of patients with  severe hypertension have responded to the combination product. Losartan potassium  appears to be effective in elderly patients. Losartan potassium is very well  tolerated. In clinical trials, dizziness was the only drug-related event reported  more frequently with losartan potassium monotherapy than with placebo. First-dose  hypotension is uncommon. An aspect of the drug's tolerability profile which may  prove to be particularly advantageous is that it is associated with a similar  incidence of cough to placebo in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-related  cough. Additionally, clinically relevant adverse metabolic effects or laboratory  abnormalities have not been documented during losartan potassium therapy and  renal function is preserved in patients with or without renal insufficiency. The  adverse effect profile of the losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide combination  resembles those for losartan potassium monotherapy and placebo. Long term  tolerability data are limited (<2 years) but support the very good tolerability  profile in shorter studies. Elements of the drug's profile yet to be assessed or  reported fully in the literature include long term efficacy; potential to  favourably influence cardiovascular and renovascular systems (and ultimately  mortality) in patients with hypertension and, lastly, cost effectiveness and  influence on quality of life. In summary, losartan potassium is the first AT(1)+  receptor antagonist to become available for the management of hypertension and,  as such, it is an important new antihypertensive agent. Pending long term data as  outlined above, it is likely to find initial use in patients with mild to severe  hypertension who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of their current therapy.  However, with its novel mechanism of action, good efficacy and favourable  tolerability profile, losartan potassium is well placed to claim a prominent  position in the management of patients with essential hypertension in the future.","1996-05","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:45","","820-845","","5","51","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8861549","","","","Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Imidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Losartan; Tetrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In elderly patients (> or = 70  years of age) with clinically stable congestive heart failure, the addition of  nebivolol to the treatment regimen improved the time to all-cause mortality and  cardiovascular hospital admissions over that of placebo. If approved, nebivolol  would likely be a viable alternative therapy for hypertension and heart failure;  however, additional studies are needed in patients having coronary artery  disease.","2006-10","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:49:55","","259-264","","5","14","","Cardiol Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16924166","","","","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Benzopyrans/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Ethanolamines/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Heart Failure/drug therapy/physiopathology; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Nebivolol; Vasodilation/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results of a recent study examining the effects of combination  terazosin and verapamil therapy on blood pressure and heart rate are also  presented. In several studies of the combination of terazosin plus a diuretic  (hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, amiloride,  triamterene, metolazone, or spironolactone), significant decreases in one or more  of the blood pressure variables studied were demonstrated (compared with diuretic  plus placebo). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of terazosin plus  atenolol, supine and standing blood pressures decreased significantly from  baseline (atenolol monotherapy) after the addition of terazosin but not placebo.  In a study of terazosin added to background therapy (including beta-blockers,  diuretics, methyldopa, clonidine, captopril, guanethidine, hydralazine, and  nifedipine), the addition of terazosin resulted in significant decreases in  supine and standing diastolic blood pressures compared with baseline values  (background therapy alone). Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin  and verapamil reduced blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than  either agent alone. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results indicate that terazosin  did not alter the metabolism of verapamil. No significant abnormal laboratory  test results have been reported for patients taking terazosin in combination with  other antihypertensive agents; in fact some evidence suggests that terazosin may  attenuate adverse lipid, glucose, and potassium changes associated with thiazide  diuretics. Adverse experiences associated with terazosin combination therapy are  usually mild to moderate. Results from all these studies suggest that terazosin  effectively controls mild-to-moderate hypertension when it is used in combination  with other antihypertensive agents without cumulative adverse effects.","1991-09","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:34:24","","926-931","","3 Pt 2","122","","Am Heart J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1678924","","","","Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Diuretics/therapeutic use; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Prazosin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Verapamil/administration & dosage/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are advantages and disadvantages of this form  of therapy. The key aims are to: (i) achieve increased efficacy by using drugs  that complement each other's actions; (ii) use low doses to minimise adverse  effects; and (iii) provide a simple once daily regimen. Fixed dose combinations  containing metoprolol have the advantage that beta-blockers are drugs for which  there is most evidence that they are cardioprotective; metoprolol is the best  documented beta-blocker in this context. The early combination of conventional  release metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide was inadequately investigated by  modern standards, but proved well tolerated and effective in clinical practice.  The introduction of the long acting metoprolol CR/ZOK (controlled release/zero  order kinetics) produced a very satisfactory once daily preparation with no major  pharmacokinetic interactions. The fixed dose combination of felodipine and  metoprolol CR/ZOK has been well investigated. The two agents complement each  other's actions and together provide very effective blood pressure control,  cardioprotection and very good tolerability. A case can be made that this  preparation more closely meets the requirements of an ideal antihypertensive than  a single agent given alone.","1995-09","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:25:47","","454-464","","3","50","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8521768","","","","*Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Felodipine/therapeutic use; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Metoprolol/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Control of elevated blood pressure reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates  among older hypertensive patients.

The antihypertensive efficacy of  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been questioned in this age group,  in which low-renin hypertension is common. The latter condition might be thought  to favor blood pressure control with diuretics and impair the response to  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, recent studies with  lisinopril, a new long-acting, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitor, indicate that reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in  older hypertensive patients receiving either angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitor or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy were not significantly different.

Michel are used in Brazilian folk medicine as a diuretic drug, to date, no study has evaluated  the mechanisms involved in this activity after prolonged administration in rats.  AIM OF THE STUDY: Evaluate the possible mechanisms involved in the prolonged  diuretic activity of ethanol soluble fraction obtained from Echinodorus  grandiflorus (ES-EG) and to assess its relationship with hypotensive and  antihypertensive activity using normotensive rats and those with renovascular  hypertension (2K1C). METHODS: The diuretic effects of ES-EG (30-300 mg/kg; p.o.)  were compared with hydrochlorothiazide in a repeated-dose treatment for 7 days.  The urinary volume and sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate contents,  conductivity, pH and density were estimated in sample collected in 24 h for 7  days. Plasma sodium, potassium, total protein, urea, creatinine, aldosterone,  vasopressin, nitrite, acetylcholinesterase concentration and angiotensin  converting enzyme (ACE) activity were measured in samples collected at the end of  the experimental period (seventh day). Using pharmacological antagonists or  inhibitors, the involvement of bradykinin, prostaglandin, acetylcholine and  nitric oxide (NO) in ES-EG-induced diuresis was determined. In addition,  activities of erythrocytary carbonic anhydrase and renal Na+/K+/ATPase were  evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: ES-EG increased diuresis similarly to  hydrochlorothiazide and also presented HCO3-sparing effects and increased serum  nitrite levels. Moreover, the intraduodenal administration of ES-EG induces  significant hypotensive and antihypertensive effects in 2K1C rats. Previous  treatment with HOE-140, indometacin and atropine fully avoided the diuretic  effect of ES-EG, and including L-NAME pre-administration, it prevented the  hypotensive and hypertensive activity induced by ES-EG. In addition, the  association between HOE-140 and atropine or indometacin and L-NAME fully  inhibited the hypotensive and antihypertensive effects of ES-EG. The 7-day  treatment with ES-EG resulted in increased plasma nitrite levels. All other  parameters were not affected by treatment with ES-EG. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  suggest that the mechanisms through which Echinodorus grandiflorus extracts  induce prolonged diuresis and reduce blood pressure in normotensive and 2K1C rats  are mainly related to activation of muscarinic and bradykinin receptors with  direct effects on prostaglandins and nitric oxide pathways.","2016-10-15","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:34:29","","1249-1258","","11","23","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015.

Blood pressures were measured during non-study  office visits and were retrieved from automated medical records. Questionnaires  were used to obtain other covariate information. The ratio of the dosing interval  to the half-life of drug activity (I') was used to capture conformity with FDA  guidelines. Data analysis focused on the interaction between I' and the impact on  blood pressure of delayed dosing.

This review explores the role of AZL-M/CLD in treating patients with  hypertension. METHODS: A systematic review of literature published from 1990 to  2018 was performed by using the following key words: Edarbyclor, azilsartan,  chlorthalidone, pharmacokinetic, and hypertension. Available English-language  data from reviews, abstracts, presentations, and clinical trials regarding the  use of AZL-M/CLD therapy specifically detailing effects of lowering blood  pressure (BP) and outcomes on cardiovascular disease in humans and rats were  reviewed. FINDINGS: One study compared a single-pill combination of AZL-M/CLD  with co-administration of AZL-M and hydrochlorothiazide and found a greater  reduction in clinic systolic BP with AZL-M/CLD (-35.1 mm Hg vs -29.5 mm Hg) than  for AZL-M and hydrochlorothiazide. Another study of 153 patients with chronic  kidney disease who received AZL-M/CLD or other single-pill combination agents  found that AZL-M/CLD was more effective in lowering BP, achieving superior  adherence. According to new guidelines, an increase in the prevalence of  resistant hypertension can occur as a result of trying to lower target BP.  IMPLICATIONS: A powerful and effective medication that can increase patient  compliance is essential to reduce the incidence of resistant hypertension.  AZL-M/CLD is a powerful and safe antihypertensive medication that has been  thoroughly studied in patients with hypertension.","2020-07","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:27:50","","1390-1403","","7","42","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A preliminary review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199549050-00008","","Spirapril is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug which is converted to the active metabolite spiraprilat following oral  administration, and which has been evaluated primarily for the treatment of  hypertension. In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe  hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood  pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic)  [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood  pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had  occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The  dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once  daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further  studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril  can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials,  spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with  enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with  hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium  antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an  adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small  studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients  with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance  mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a  predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active  metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in  this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data  regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective  antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are  needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and  a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in  hypertensive patients with renal failure.","1995-05","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:33:11","","750-766","","5","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7601014","","","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After an  unusually high rate of recent anesthetization failures, we sought to determine  the frequency of reduced anesthetization and any common factors underlying these  failures. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent IAP  tests through the UCLA Seizure Disorder Center between September 1999 and May  2002. Age, date, epileptogenic focus, radiologist, and current medications were  all considered. RESULTS: Of a total of 56 patients who underwent our intracarotid  amobarbital examination, 11 (19.6%) showed either very rapid recovery (<or=1 min)  or anesthetization failure. Of these, 10 (91%) of 11 were taking a medication  with some carbonic anhydrase-inhibiting (CAI) properties (topiramate (TPM), n=7;  zonisamide (ZNS), n=2; hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide, n=1 each). The only  patient of 40 (2.5%) who was not taking any CAI drugs and showed an early IAP  recovery (55 s) had recently discontinued TPM. IAPs performed on patients after  weaning from TPM showed a correlation between length of drug discontinuation and  duration of anesthesia effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly suggest that recent  failures of anesthetization during the IAP are associated with a possible  interaction between amobarbital and medications possessing CAI properties.

It is readily absorbed, with high bioavailability and  a relatively long plasma half-life, neither of which property is influenced by  age. This accounts for the prolonged pharmacologic activity of doxazosin  following a single oral dose. Its prime pharmacodynamic activity resides in its  ability to counter sympathetic vasoconstriction of the systemic arteriolar  resistance vessels and venous capacitance system, which enables the drug to  target the major pathophysiologic abnormality in hypertension, i.e., the  generalized systemic arteriolar constriction. The widespread vasodilation induced  by doxazosin relieves both cardiac preload and afterload and, consequently,  reduces left ventricular wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption. In  hypertension, doxazosin reduces blood pressure both at rest and during exercise  by reduction of systemic vascular resistance without precipitating substantial  reflex cardiac stimulation. The effects are maximal on the standing blood  pressure between two and four hours after ingestion; due to doxazosin's  relatively slow absorption, postural hypotension is infrequent. Its  antihypertensive activity is maintained over 24 hours following a single oral  dose, and the optimal dose range is 2 to 8 mg once daily. The antihypertensive  efficacy of doxazosin has been shown to be comparable with that of other  alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitors, beta-blocking drugs, diuretics, calcium  antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast to other  conventional antihypertensive drugs, a unique feature of  alpha-adrenoceptor-inhibiting drugs, including doxazosin, is their ability to  reduce the plasma concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and to increase high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol concentration. This contrasts with the opposite effect on lipid  levels induced by hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol seen in comparative studies.  Side effects show no predilection for any organ system, and the overall incidence  of such effects compares well with those of other commonly used antihypertensive  drugs. This unique combination of antihypertensive efficacy and favorable effect  on blood lipid levels indicates that once-daily treatment with doxazosin holds  considerable promise in the treatment of hypertension, both from the point of  view of its antihypertensive efficacy and also from its primary preventative  potential.","1989-08-16","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:49:25","","2S-11S","","2A","87","","Am J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2569822","","","","Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Coronary Disease/drug therapy; Doxazosin; Hemodynamics/*drug effects; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Prazosin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When used in combination with  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics,  amlodipine can produce important additional antihypertensive effects. Studies  involving long-term use of amlodipine in hypertension indicate that no tolerance  appears, and that amlodipine is a well tolerated drug.","1991-08","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:49:10","","61-66","","","5 Suppl 1","","J Hum Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1834848","","","","*Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Amlodipine; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy/physiopathology; Longitudinal Studies; Nifedipine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Medical records of patients with a  diagnosis of diabetes or use of antidiabetic medications between January 1, 2002  and September 30, 2005 in the U.K. and Germany Mediplus databases were obtained.  PATIENTS: Medication use profiles were evaluated between April 2004 and September  2005. The metabolic pathways associated with medications that were prescribed  chronically to at least 10% of study patients were compared with the metabolic  pathways of neuropathic pain medications to identify potential drug-drug  interactions. RESULTS: A total of 40,448 patients in the U.K. (63.6 +/- 16.6  years, 51% male) and 31,930 patients in Germany (68.9 +/- 12.7 years, 46% male)  were identified. Frequently prescribed medications in the U.K. included aspirin  (33.7%), metformin (32.7%), simvastatin (25.5%), atorvastatin (19.4%), atenolol  (18.1%), and in Germany hydrochlorothiazide (35.8%), aspirin (25.2%), metformin  (21.6%), metoprolol (20.3%), and simvastatin (18.3%). Several neuropathic pain  medications have potential for drug-drug interactions with medications prescribed  to diabetes patients.

Sources for the assays were  purified CA II, adult rat cortical, oligodendrocyte and neuronal enriched  preparations; cultured murine glial cells, rat C-6 glioma, rat hepatoma and human  glioblastoma cells. CA enzyme activity in the same preparations was also assayed  by following change in pH during incubation. A gel permeation chromatographic  method was developed to assess [3H]AZ binding to soluble CA, while glass fiber  filter vacuum filtration was used for particulate CA binding. Saturable specific  binding of [3H]AZ to rat cortical soluble and particulate CA preparations was  demonstrated. Computer-assisted data analysis estimated the binding parameters of  [3H]AZ to soluble rat cortical CA to be Bmax = 0.38 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg protein and  Kd = 34.7 +/- 17.5 nM. The rat cortical particulate fraction Bmax was 2.05 +/-  0.28 pmol/mg protein with a Kd of 107.1 +/- 24.2 nM. Purified bovine CA-II bound  1.15 +/- 0.19 pmol [3H]AZ/mg protein with a Kd of 54.0 +/- 3.4 nM. The pH optima  for [3H]AZ binding to soluble and particulate CA was between 6.5 and 7.5. Binding  was linear with respect to protein up to 1.0 mg/mL. The particulate fraction  bound 3-4 times more [3H]ligand per unit protein than the soluble fraction.  Interestingly, no detectable CA enzyme activity or [3H]AZ binding was observed in  the soluble or particulate fractions of human glioblastoma, rat C-6 glioma or rat  hepatoma cells. Binding of [3H]AZ to other soluble enzymes or proteins was  negligible. In competition binding experiments, a rank order of inhibition of  [3H]AZ binding to rat cortical CA by established CA inhibitors was:  dichlorphenamide greater than acetazolamide greater than or equal to benzolamide  greater than methazolamide greater than hydrochlorothiazide greater than or equal  to sulfanilamide. [3H]AZ binding was not affected by other classes of  pharmacologic characterizing agents.

Articles on pregnancy in GS were also  systemically reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 101 GS patients were included; among  them, 42.6% were female and 79.2% showed hypomagnesaemia. A lower proportion of  female patients presented before 18 years of age, with less frequently reported  polyuria, higher serum potassium and less urine sodium and chloride excretions.  There was no gender difference in the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC)  dysfunction evaluated by hydrochlorothiazide test. Twelve of the 43 female GS  patients delivered after disease symptom onset, and their pregnancies were  generally uneventful. As a group, pregnant GS patients had lower potassium levels  in the first-trimester (P = .002) requiring higher potassium supplementation.  After delivery, serum potassium (P = .02) and magnesium (P = .03) increased  significantly. Both caesarean section and vaginal delivery were safe.

We present a case report describing a probable drug  interaction between warfarin and bosentan in a patient with pulmonary  hypertension. CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old black female (weight, 77 kg) diagnosed  with pulmonary hypertension secondary to bilateral pulmonary emboli had a stable  international normalized ratio (INR; target range, 2-3) with a weekly warfarin  dose of 52.5 mg for 2 months before the initiation of bosentan therapy. Other  concurrent medications included telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 40/12.5 mg once  daily and a daily multivitamin (which contained no vitamin K). Three weeks after  starting bosentan 62.5 mg BID, a therapeutic INR concentration was reached with a  weekly warfarin dose 14% higher (an increase of 7.5 mg/wk) than her weekly  warfarin dose before initiation of bosentan. After a brief discontinuation (7  days) and retitration of bosentan and warfarin, the final weekly warfarin dose  (75 mg/wk) was 43% greater (an increase of 22.5 mg/wk) than the previously stable  dose, which enabled the patient to reach her therapeutic INR goal range of 2 to  3. CONCLUSIONS: Bosentan has CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-inducing properties and is  therefore likely to cause decreased concentrations of warfarin. We describe here  a probable drug interaction between bosentan and warfarin that resulted in a 43%  increase in warfarin dose to maintain the patient's therapeutic INR.","2010-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:42:57","","53-56","","1","32","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20171411","","","","Anticoagulants/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/drug effects/metabolism; Bosentan; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/drug effects/metabolism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Interactions; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary/complications/*drug therapy; International Normalized Ratio; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Embolism/complications/*drug therapy; Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Treatment Outcome; Warfarin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The acute effect of ketanserin 10mg intravenously was  studied in 57 patients between 25 and 90 years and a significant negative  correlation was shown between age and the decrease in both systolic and diastolic  blood pressure. In longer term studies ketanserin has been compared with  metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide in patients below and above 60 years. Both  ketanserin and the diuretic showed greater antihypertensive efficacy in the  elderly, whereas the beta-blocker did not. Data from 15 double-blind studies from  the ketanserin International Data File confirm the relationship between age and  antihypertensive efficacy. With respect to adverse effects of ketanserin,  dizziness, somnolence and dryness of the mouth were commoner in younger than  older patients. These effects were not the result of smaller dose requirements in  the elderly, and there was no obvious pharmacokinetic reason (e.g. alteration in  drug clearance) for the difference. Two theoretical possibilities for the  differential age effect of ketanserin are advanced. First the smaller effect in  the young may be due to activation of homeostatic mechanisms limiting its  antihypertensive activity, or second, some selective (undefined) effect operative  in the elderly may be responsible. It is known from animal studies that serotonin  shows increased vasoconstrictor properties in the presence of extensive atheroma.  Antagonism of this effect may account for the greater vasodilator and  antihypertensive effect of ketanserin in elderly patients. This, however, is  speculative and does not take into account the complex antihypertensive action of  ketanserin. The role of serotonin in cardiovascular control is complex. Its  effects depend on the species studied, the vascular bed being investigated, the  dose used and the experimental conditions employed. Serotonin has central cardiac  and peripheral vascular actions relevant to cardiovascular control. In the  peripheral vasculature it can produce vasodilatation or vasoconstriction by  either direct or indirect mechanisms. If this complexity were not confusing  enough, the nomenclature of the receptors on which serotonin acts is under  intense current debate, and little uniformity exists as to the terminology to be  used. The terms of this review will be very specific.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400  WORDS)","1988","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:29:44","","44-54","","","36 Suppl 1","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3071462","","","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/physiology; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Ketanserin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Middle Aged; Serotonin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (  approximately 270 g) underwent one of the following three treatments for 4 wk (n  = 6/group): 1) control; 2) insulin-infused plus 20% dextrose in drinking water;  or 3) glucose water-drinking (20% dextrose in water).

Neither insulin nor glucose affected the renal protein abundances of  NCC or the ENaC subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) in kidney cortex, outer  medulla, or inner medulla in a major way, as determined by immunoblotting.  However, insulin and to some extent glucose increased apical localization of  these subunits in cortical collecting duct principal cells, as determined by  immunoperoxidase labeling. In addition, insulin decreased cortical ""with no  lysine"" kinase (WNK4) abundance (by 16% relative to control), which may have  increased NCC activity.

The theoretical therapeutic  advantages for inhibiting the detrimental effects of the renin-angiotensin system  at its most upstream point have served as the impetus for the development of  renin inhibitors. The advent of aliskiren, the first in a novel class of orally  active, nonpeptide, highly specific, human renin inhibitors, provides a new  modality in the armamentarium of renin-angiotensin system antagonists. Studies in  marmosets and rats demonstrated that aliskiren reduced blood pressure in a  dose-dependent manner and is highly efficacious in blocking plasma renin activity  with parallel reductions in the levels of the other downstream constituents of  the renin-angiotensin system. Clinical trials in hypertensive patients have  confirmed these benefits with aliskiren whose blood pressure-lowering efficacy is  similar to or better than those of standard therapeutic doses of enalapril,  losartan, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is well tolerated, with  few reported adverse effects even at the highest doses tested. Given the  established beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and  angiotensin receptor blockers in the treatment of cardiovascular and renovascular  diseases, future studies may further elucidate a similar protective role for  aliskiren both as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy.","2007-10","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:38:14","","242-256","","5","15","","Cardiol Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17700383","","","","Aldosterone/blood; Amides/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Angiotensin II/blood/physiology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Fumarates/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Humans; Irbesartan; Kidney/blood supply; Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Receptors, Angiotensin/drug effects/physiology; Regional Blood Flow; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects/physiology; Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tetrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Net treatment effects were computed by subtracting  the mean changes from baseline during placebo (n = 133) from those during active  treatment (n = 111). At entry, systolic/diastolic pressures averaged 176/86 mm Hg  in the clinic and 149/80 mm Hg on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. With corrections  applied for baseline and placebo, nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/d), with the possible  addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25  mg/d), reduced (P < .001) these blood pressure values by 16.6/7.3 and 9.8/4.7 mm  Hg, respectively. The net trough-to-peak ratios were first determined from blood  pressure profiles (12 hours) with 1-hour precision, synchronized by the morning  and evening doses of the double-blind medication. According to the usual  approach, disregarding interindividual variability, the systolic/diastolic net  trough-to-peak ratios were 0.46/0.40 in the morning and 0.77/0.99 in the evening.  In individual subjects, the baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were  nonnormally distributed. We therefore used a nonparametric technique to calculate  the net trough-to-peak ratios from the results in individual subjects. In the  morning, these ratios averaged 0.25 systolic (95% confidence interval, 0.09 to  0.41) and 0.15 diastolic (95% confidence interval, 0.00 to 0.31) and in the  evening, 0.19 and 0.36 (95% confidence intervals, 0.00 to 0.38 and 0.14 to 0.56),  respectively. When the blood pressure profiles were smoothed by substituting the  1-hour averages by moving or fixed 2-hour averages or by Fourier modeling, the  trough-to-peak ratios remained unchanged after the morning dose (0.20/0.13,  0.20/0.14, and 0.16/0.21, respectively) but tended to increase in the evening  (0.32/0.38, 0.28/0.40, and 0.48/0.49). In conclusion, the parallel-group analysis  proposed makes it possible for one to correct the trough-to-peak ratio for  baseline as well as placebo, to account for interindividual variability, and to  calculate a confidence interval for the net trough-to-peak ratio. Accounting for  interindividual variability reduces the trough-to-peak ratio. Smoothing affects  the individualized net trough-to-peak ratios in an unpredictable way and should  therefore be avoided.","1997-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:43:01","","659-667","","2","29","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9040453","","","","Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Male; Middle Aged","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An updated review of its therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199549030-00008","","Ramipril is a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Like enalapril, it is a prodrug and is hydrolysed in vivo to release the active  metabolite, ramiprilat, which has a long elimination half-life, permitting  once-daily administration. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril has been  confirmed in large-scale noncomparative studies conducted in general practice as  well as in more rigorously controlled clinical trials. In the former,  approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension have  responded successfully to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg/day, while  comparative trials indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug is  equivalent to that of other established ACE inhibitors and the beta-adrenoceptor  antagonist atenolol. As expected, the response rate to ramipril monotherapy is  lower in patients with severe hypertension (around 40%), although the blood  pressure lowering effect can be enhanced with the addition of a diuretic such as  hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril is  maintained in patients with diabetes mellitus and preliminary data indicate that  the drug has the beneficial effect of decreasing urinary albumin excretion in  diabetic patients with nephropathy. Ramipril is superior to atenolol in causing  regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, although the clinical significance of  this effect per se remains to be established. The large-scale Acute Infarction  Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study demonstrated that ramipril 5 or 10 mg/day  significantly decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 27% in patients with  clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction, even if  transient. The beneficial effect of ramipril was apparent by 30 days of treatment  and appeared to be greatest in patients with more severe ventricular damage after  infarction. Ramipril is well tolerated in general practice, with 5% or fewer  patients discontinuing therapy because of drug intolerance. The data available  suggest that ramipril shares a similar tolerability profile to that of other  established ACE inhibitors. Thus, clinical data confirm ramipril as a useful  alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate  hypertension, and indicate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with  clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. It is also  reasonable to assume that ramipril will be of value in the treatment of patients  with more established heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.","1995-03","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:14","","440-466","","3","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7774515","","","","Aging/metabolism; Diabetes Complications; Female; Heart Failure/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Humans; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/complications/drug therapy; Kallikrein-Kinin System/drug effects; Kidney/drug effects; Male; Myocardial Infarction/complications/drug therapy; Ramipril/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Vascular Resistance/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although its exact mechanism of action in  these disease states has not been precisely defined, the potent coronary and  peripheral arterial dilator properties of nicardipine, with concomitant  improvements in oxygen supply/demand and reductions in systemic vascular  resistance, are of major importance. Clinical studies have shown that nicardipine  appears to be effective in the treatment of chronic stable exercise-induced  angina pectoris and possibly in angina at rest due to coronary artery spasm. In  the treatment of stable angina, nicardipine has proved to be equally as effective  as nifedipine. However, haemodynamic and clinical studies indicate that  nicardipine may have a further advantage of not depressing cardiac conduction or  left ventricular function, even in patients with compromised cardiac pumping  ability. Nicardipine also appears to be useful as initial monotherapy or in  combination with other antihypertensive drugs when used in the treatment of mild  to moderate hypertension, and may have some advantages over other vasodilators in  this regard in that it may not be as frequently associated with fluid retention  or weight gain as other similar drugs. In the treatment of hypertension  nicardipine has been shown to be as effective as drugs such as  hydrochlorothiazide, cyclopenthiazide, propranolol and verapamil in short term  studies although confirmation of its long term usefulness in well-designed  clinical trials is still required. Similarly, although the use of nicardipine in  other disorders such as congestive heart failure and cerebrovascular disease has  provided encouraging preliminary results, more studies are needed to clarify its  place in their treatment. Side effects appear to be dose related and more  frequent within the first few weeks of therapy. Most of these effects are minor  and transient in nature and include headache, flushing and peripheral oedema.  Thus, there is no doubt that nicardipine provides a suitable alternative to other  drugs available for the treatment of angina and hypertension. However, further  well-designed comparative clinical trials are needed to clarify its relative  place in the long term management of these disorders.","1987-04","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:42:55","","296-345","","4","33","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3297616","","","","Angina Pectoris/*drug therapy; Cardiovascular Diseases/*drug therapy; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Kinetics; Nicardipine/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certain  agents that modify the RAAS can control blood pressure and improve cardiovascular  outcomes. Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents known  as renin inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to discuss the  clinical pharmacology of aliskiren and its use in the management of hypertension,  as well as potential uses in other cardiovascular disorders. METHODS:  Peer-reviewed articles and abstracts were identified from the MEDLINE and Current  Contents databases (both 1966-October 1, 2007) using the search terms aliskiren,  drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. Citations from available  articles were reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at recent  professional meetings were also examined. RESULTS: Nine published clinical  studies have evaluated the effect of aliskiren in lowering blood pressure in  hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive  agents. This review summarizes those studies. Patients treated with aliskiren had  significantly lower blood pressure compared with patients with mild to moderate  hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140-180 mm Hg and diastolic blood  pressure [DBP] 95-110 mm Hg) who received placebo. Aliskiren in doses of 75 to  300 mg daily produced reductions of SBP (-5.3 to -15.8 mm Hg) and DBP (-5.8 to  -12.3 mm Hg); placebo produced reductions of SBP that ranged from -2.85 to -10.0  mm Hg and DBP reductions from -3.26 to -8.6 mm Hg (P < 0.05 in all studies  between aliskiren and placebo). Aliskiren's blood pressure-lowering effect at  doses of 75 to 300 mg daily was comparable to irbesartan 150 mg daily and  valsartan 80 to 360 mg daily alone. When aliskiren was added to ramipril,  hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan, or valsartan, significant additive  blood pressure-lowering effects were reported (P < 0.05 in all clinical trials).  The total incidence of adverse events was similar to placebo and other  comparative agents, including irbesartan, valsartan, losartan, ramipril, and  hydrochlorothiazide. The overall adverse-event rates were 22%, 35% to 52%, 25% to  52%, 34% to 55%, and 33% to 52% for aliskiren 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg,  respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events included headache,  dizziness, and fatigue. Studies with cardiovascular outcomes as end points have  not been performed with aliskiren. CONCLUSIONS: Aliskiren is an effective  alternative agent for blood pressure management. Before aliskiren can be  recommended as a routine first-line agent, however, clinical studies must explore  if the blood pressure-lowering effect will translate into improvement in  cardiovascular outcomes.","2008-01","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 13:30:40","","31-47","","1","30","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18343241","","","","Amides/economics/*pharmacology; Antihypertensive Agents/economics/*pharmacology; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Fumarates/economics/*pharmacology; Humans; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Renin-Angiotensin System/physiology; Renin/antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vitro,  moexiprilat was a potent inhibitor of ACE in guinea pig serum as well as on  purified ACE from rabbit lung with IC50 values of 2.6 and 4.9 nmol/l,  respectively. Both, moexipril and moexiprilat inhibited the angiotensin I (ANG  I)-induced contractions of rabbit aorta concentration-dependently, whereas  contractions by other agents were not affected, indicating a high selectivity of  both compounds for ACE. Similar results were obtained in vivo in experiments  investigating the blood pressure increasing response to intravenous injection of  ANG I or ANG II in conscious normotensive rats and dogs after oral or intravenous  application of moexipril or moexiprilat, respectively. The antihypertensive  effects of the oral application of moexipril were studied in models of  hypertension in the rat as well as in renal hypertensive dogs. In renal  hypertensive rats, moexipril (0.03-10 mg/kg p.o.) caused a dose-dependent  decrease in blood pressure with a threshold dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Once daily  treatment of the animals with 3 mg/kg/d for 5 days lowered mean blood pressure by  about 70 mmHg and blood pressure was maintained on this low level for the  experimental period. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, oral administration of  moexipril (30 mg/kg/d) for 5 days caused a progressive lowering of mean blood  pressure from pre-treatment values of 180 +/- 7 mmHg to a trough on day 4 of 127  +/- 4 mmHg. In perinephritic hypertensive dogs, oral administration of moexipril  (10 mg/kg) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg) caused a drop of  mean blood pressure by 25 mmHg from pre-treatment control, which persisted for 24  h. In all these models, the action was characterized by a rapid onset and a long  duration of action. After cessation of treatment, a gradual return to baseline  values was observed. In contrast, only slight blood pressure lowering effects  were seen in normotensive rats at high doses (100 mg/kg p.o.). The general  pharmacological properties of moexipril were also studied in generally accepted  models in vitro and in vivo. In doses or concentrations more than 100 times  higher than those causing ACE inhibition, no effects were observed on the central  nervous system, on isolated smooth muscle preparations, the digestive system, the  kidney or the lung. Additionally, moexipril is devoid of anti-inflammatory  properties and has no effect on platelet function. On the cardiovascular system,  the effects observed can be attributed to ACE inhibition by moexipril. Repeated  dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed the heart and kidneys as target  organs. These effects, based on highly exaggerated pharmacological activity, are  comparable to other ACE-inhibitors. No potential for mutagenic or carcinogenic  activity and no evidence of reproductive toxicity was apparent for meoxipril. The  preclinical data indicate that moexipril possesses a high degree of specifity as  an ACE-inhibitor without relevant side effects or gross toxicity.","1997-02","2023-09-05 12:07:46","2023-09-05 14:21:35","","132-144","","2","47","","Arzneimittelforschung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 9079232","","","","*Tetrahydroisoquinolines; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*toxicity; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology; Central Nervous System/drug effects; Dogs; Female; Guinea Pigs; In Vitro Techniques; Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*toxicity; Lung/drug effects/enzymology; Male; Mice; Muscle Contraction/drug effects; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects; Pregnancy; Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*toxicity; Rabbits; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rats, Wistar; Species Specificity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chromatography was carried out on RP18 column with mobile phase  comprising of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) and methanol in gradient mode. The  calibration curves were linear for all nine permeability model compounds (r² >  0.999) across the concentration range of 1.25-40 μg/ml.

Stability studies were carried out at  different storage conditions and all the analytes were found to be stable. The  method was successfully applied for analysing the permeability samples obtained  from in situ single pass perfusion studies. The effective permeability (P(eff))  values obtained upon cassette administration were in close proximity to the  permeability values obtained upon single administration of model compounds.

METHODS: Randomized, open-label, crossover, bioavailability studies  were conducted separately in healthy Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers. One  tablet either of test or of reference product was administered after 10 hours of  overnight fasting. After dosing, serial blood samples were collected for a period  of 48 hours for both the studies. Plasma samples were analyzed for losartan,  losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide by a validated liquid  chromatographic and mass spectrometric method (LC-MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic  parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, tmax, and other pharmacokinetics parameters were  determined from plasma concentration-time profiles for both test and reference  formulations of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 + 12.5 mg tablets. Statistical  evaluations were done to evaluate bioequivalence between generic test formulation  (EPR0001) and Japanese reference product (Preminent®). RESULTS: Losartan,  losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide were well tolerated by subjects  in all periods of each study under fasted conditions. No serious adverse events  were observed. The ratios of least square means for AUC0-t and Cmax and the  affiliated 90% confidence intervals were within acceptance range recommended by  PMDA. Marginal differences were observed in pharmacokinetic values of Asian  Indian and Japanese volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these bioavailability  studies indicate that the test formulation of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 50 +  12.5 mg (EPR0001) tablets is bioequivalent to marketed Preminent® reference  formulation in Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers, when administered under  fasting conditions. Both test and reference formulations were well tolerated as a  single oral dose when administered to healthy adult subjects under fasted  conditions. Although Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers are ethnically  different, results of these studies indicate that pharmacokinetic parameters of  Asian Indian and Japanese volunteers are comparable to each other in terms of  bioavailability of losartan, losartan carboxylic acid and hydrochlorothiazide.  Similar least square means ratios were obtained in Asian Indian and Japanese  volunteers demonstrating that a bioequivalence study conducted on Japanese  volunteers seems to be substituted by Asian Indian volunteers' studies.","2014-01","2023-09-05 12:04:13","2023-09-05 14:27:42","","39-54","","1","52","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 24290414","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Asian People; Biological Availability; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Combinations; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacokinetics; India; Losartan/*pharmacokinetics; Male; Middle Aged; Tablets; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Therapeutic Equivalency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
