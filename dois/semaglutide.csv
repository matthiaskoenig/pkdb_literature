We aimed to determine the safety, tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of this drug combination. METHODS: In this  randomised, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose, phase 1b trial,  individuals aged 18-55 years with a body-mass index 27·0-39·9 kg/m(2) and who  were otherwise healthy were recruited from a single centre in the USA. The trial  included six sequential overlapping cohorts, and in each cohort eligible  participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to once-weekly subcutaneous  cagrilintide (0·16, 0·30, 0·60, 1·2, 2·4, or 4·5 mg) or matched placebo, in  combination with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg, without lifestyle  interventions. In each cohort, the doses of cagrilintide and semaglutide were  co-escalated in 4-week intervals to the desired dose over 16 weeks, participants  were treated at the target dose for 4 weeks, and then followed up for 5 weeks.  Participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment.  The primary endpoint was number of treatment-emergent adverse events from  baseline to end of follow-up. Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints assessed from  day of last dose (week 19) to end of treatment (week 20) were area under the  plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 168 h (AUC(0-168 h)) and maximum  concentration [C(max)] of cagrilintide and semaglutide; exploratory  pharmacokinetic endpoints were half-life, time to C(max) [t(max)], plasma  clearance, and volume of distribution of cagrilintide and semaglutide; and  exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints were changes in bodyweight, glycaemic  parameters, and hormones. Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic endpoints  were assessed in all participants who were exposed to at least one dose of study  drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03600480, and is now  complete. FINDINGS: Between July 25, 2018, and Dec 17, 2019, 285 individuals were  screened and 96 were randomly assigned to cagrilintide (0·16-2·4 mg group n=12;  4·5 mg group n=11) or placebo (n=24), in combination with semaglutide 2·4 mg, of  whom 95 were exposed to treatment (one patient in 0·60 mg cagrilintide group was  not exposed) and included in the safety and full analysis datasets. The mean age  was 40·6 years (SD 9·2), 56 (59%) of 95 participants were men and 51 (54%) were  Black or African American. Of 566 adverse events reported in 92 participants (69  [97%] of 71 participants assigned to 0·16-4·5 mg cagrilintide and 23 [96%] of 24  assigned to placebo), 207 (37%) were gastrointestinal disorders. Most adverse  events were mild to moderate in severity and the proportion of participants with  one or more adverse event was similar across treatment groups. Exposure was  proportional to cagrilintide dose and did not affect semaglutide exposure or  elimination. AUC(0-168 h) ranged from 926 nmol × h/L to 24 271 nmol × h/L, and  C(max) ranged from 6·14 nmol/L to 170 nmol/L with cagrilintide 0·16-4·5 mg.  AUC(0-168 h) ranged from 12 757 nmol × h/L to 15 305 nmol × h/L, and C(max)  ranged from 96·4 nmol/L to 120 nmol/L with semaglutide 2·4 mg. Cagrilintide  0·16-4·5 mg had a half-life of 159-195 h, with a median t(max) of 24-72 h.  Semaglutide 2·4 mg had a half-life of 145-165 h, with a median t(max) of 12-24 h.  Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for both cagrilintide and semaglutide  were similar across treatment groups. At week 20, mean percentage bodyweight  reductions were greater with cagrilintide 1·2 and 2·4 mg than with placebo (15·7%  [SE 1·6] for cagrilintide 1·2 mg and 17·1% [1·5] for cagrilintide 2·4 mg vs 9·8%  [1·2] for pooled placebo cohorts 1-5; estimated treatment difference of -6·0%  [95% CI -9·9 to -2·0] for cagrilintide 1·2 mg and -7·4% [-11·2 to -3·5] for  cagrilintide 2·4 mg vs pooled placebo), and with cagrilintide 4·5 mg than with  matched placebo (15·4% [1·3] vs 8·0% [2·2]; estimated treatment difference -7·4%  [-12·8 to -2·1]), all in combination with semaglutide 2·4 mg. Glycaemic  parameters improved in all treatment groups, independently of cagrilintide dose.  Changes in hormones were similar across treatment groups. INTERPRETATION:  Concomitant treatment with cagrilintide and semaglutide 2·4 mg was well tolerated  with an acceptable safety profile. Future larger and longer trials are needed to  fully assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment combination.

Diabetes & endocrinology","","2213-8595 2213-8587","10.1016/S2213-8587(18)30024-X","","BACKGROUND: Despite common mechanisms of actions, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists differ in structure, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical  effects. This head-to-head trial compared semaglutide with dulaglutide in  patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was an  open-label, parallel-group, phase 3b trial done at 194 hospitals, clinical  institutions or private practices in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18  years or older and had type 2 diabetes with HbA(1c) 7·0-10·5% (53·0-91·0  mmol/mol) on metformin monotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by  use of an interactive web-response system to once a week treatment with either  semaglutide 0·5 mg, dulaglutide 0·75 mg, semaglutide 1·0 mg, or dulaglutide 1·5  mg subcutaneously. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in percentage  HbA(1c); the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change in bodyweight, both at  week 40. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients  exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained while on treatment and  before the onset of rescue medication. The safety population included all  randomly assigned patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained  while on treatment. The trial was powered for HbA(1c) non-inferiority (margin  0·4%) and bodyweight superiority. This trial is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02648204. FINDINGS: Between Jan 6, 2016, and June  22, 2016, 1201 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; of these, 301 were  exposed to semaglutide 0·5 mg, 299 to dulaglutide 0·75 mg, 300 to semaglutide 1·0  mg, and 299 to dulaglutide 1·5 mg. 72 (6%) patients withdrew from the trial (22  receiving semaglutide 0·5 mg, 13 receiving dulaglutide 0·75 mg, 21 receiving  semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 16 receiving dulaglutide 1·5 mg). From overall baseline  mean, mean percentage HbA(1c) was reduced by 1·5 (SE 0·06) percentage points with  semaglutide 0·5 mg versus 1·1 (0·05) percentage points with dulaglutide 0·75 mg  (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·40 percentage points [95% CI -0·55 to  -0·25]; p<0·0001) and by 1·8 (0·06) percentage points with semaglutide 1·0 mg  versus 1·4 (0·06) percentage points with dulaglutide 1·5 mg (ETD -0·41 percentage  points [-0·57 to -0·25]; p<0·0001). From overall baseline mean, mean bodyweight  was reduced by 4·6 kg (SE 0·28) with semaglutide 0·5 mg compared with 2·3 kg  (0·27) with dulaglutide 0·75 mg (ETD -2·26 kg [-3·02 to -1·51]; p<0·0001) and by  6·5 kg (0·28) with semaglutide 1·0 mg compared with 3·0 kg (0·27) with  dulaglutide 1·5 mg (ETD -3·55 kg [-4·32 to -2·78]; p<0·0001). Gastrointestinal  disorders were the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 129 (43%)  of 301 patients receiving semaglutide 0·5 mg, 133 (44%) of 300 patients receiving  semaglutide 1·0 mg, 100 (33%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 0·75 mg, and  in 143 (48%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 1·5 mg. Gastrointestinal  disorders were also the most common reason for discontinuing treatment with  semaglutide and dulaglutide. There were six fatalities: one in each semaglutide  group and two in each dulaglutide group. INTERPRETATION: At low and high doses,  semaglutide was superior to dulaglutide in improving glycaemic control and  reducing bodyweight, enabling a significantly greater number of patients with  type 2 diabetes to achieve clinically meaningful glycaemic targets and weight  loss, with a similar safety profile.

Four agents in the  GLP-1 RA class, albiglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide, also have  cardioprotective effects. However, subcutaneous administration of these agents  remains a major reason for their underutilization. A new coformulation of  semaglutide with sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino caprylate (SNAC) is the  first oral GLP-1 RA reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The  SNAC technology prevents destruction of semaglutide in the stomach and  facilitates transcellular absorption through the gastric membrane enabling  semaglutide to reach systemic circulation intact. The oral formulation of  semaglutide was studied in the PIONEER trials, demonstrating similar efficacy to  the presently available GLP-1 RAs with regard to HbA1c lowering and weight loss.  Although the PIONEER 6 trial suggests positive effects on cardiovascular  mortality with oral semaglutide, these benefits may not fully be appreciated  until the completion of the SOUL trial.","2020-01","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","10-18","","1","22","","Diabetes Technol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31436480","","","","Administration, Oral; Caprylates/*pharmacokinetics; Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/prevention & control; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy; Drug Delivery Systems; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/*agonists; Glucagon-Like Peptides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Oral GLP-1 receptor agonists; PIONEER trials; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/etiology/prevention & control; Semaglutide; SNAC technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lifestyle intervention should be the first line of management for  obesity but additional pharmacotherapy is often required and bariatric surgery is  appropriate in more severe cases. Drugs acting as glucagon-like peptide-1  receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) developed for the management of T2DM reduce body  weight and liraglutide is the first GLP-1RA to be approved for the treatment of  obesity in patients with and without T2DM.Areas covered: In this review of  relevant published material, the authors summarize the pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy and safety of liraglutide for the treatment  of obesity.Expert opinion: Liraglutide effectively reduces body weight and body  fat through mechanisms involving reduced appetite and lowered energy intake,  independent of its glucose-lowering effects. Like most of the other medications  currently available for obesity, liraglutide has some common adverse effects,  although generally not serious ones. Liraglutide has additional benefits in  reducing cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM but the cost and the need  for daily injections may limit its use in obesity. Newer GLP-1RAs, such as  semaglutide, or other drugs in development for obesity may have advantages over  liraglutide.","2020-02","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","275-285","","3","21","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31790314","","","","Body Weight/drug effects; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy; GLP-1 receptor agonist; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/agonists; Glucagon-Like Peptides/therapeutic use; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic use; liraglutide; Liraglutide/*therapeutic use; obesity; Obesity/*drug therapy; semaglutide; type 2 diabetes mellitus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Levothyroxine has similar dosing conditions to oral semaglutide. This trial  investigated if oral semaglutide co-administered with levothyroxine affects  thyroxine (T(4)) exposure and if multiple placebo tablets co-administered with  oral semaglutide affect semaglutide exposure. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In  this one-sequence crossover trial, 45 healthy subjects received levothyroxine  (600 μg single-dose) alone, or with concomitant SNAC 300 mg or concomitant oral  semaglutide 14 mg at steady-state. Subjects also received oral semaglutide 14 mg  at steady-state alone or with five placebo tablets once-daily for 5 weeks.  RESULTS: A 33% increase in total T(4) exposure was observed with  levothyroxine/oral semaglutide vs levothyroxine alone, but baseline-corrected  maximum concentration (C(max)) was unaffected. SNAC alone did not affect total  T(4) exposure, whereas C(max) was slightly decreased. A 34% decrease in  semaglutide exposure was observed when oral semaglutide was co-administered with  placebo tablets, and C(max) also decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Levothyroxine  pharmacokinetics were influenced by co-administration with oral semaglutide.

The American Diabetes  Association continues to recommend metformin as the first-line initial treatment  of T2DM, in combination with lifestyle modifications; yet, many require multiple  therapies to achieve adequate glycemic control. In patients with atherosclerotic  cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, adding a  glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist is a preferred treatment option;  however, many patients are apprehensive about injecting medications. Semaglutide  is the first oral option in this life-saving medication class. The purpose of  this article was to review the pharmacology, clinical trials, safety profile,  along with recommended dosing and costs, of oral semaglutide used for managing  patients with T2DM. METHODS: A search through the PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane  libraries was conducted for literature published from January 2017 through  December 2020, using the key word semaglutide. Articles were selected if they  were related to the approval of oral semaglutide or provided novel clinical  information regarding this drug entity in its oral dosage formulation. FINDINGS:  Three Phase II studies of the pharmacokinetic properties and Phase III trials  from the PIONEER series were ultimately selected, as these trials were thought to  provide pivotal information to the US Food and Drug Administration for the  approval of oral semaglutide.

The use of this  medication has been associated with glycosylated hemoglobin lowering similar to  that with the injectable medication in its same class.

The key trials from the clinical development  process are reviewed and important end-points highlighted. Expert opinion:  Once-weekly semaglutide has shown superiority in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin  and body weight in comparison with placebo and active comparators when used as  monotherapy or in combination treatment. In addition, semaglutide improved  markers of β-cell function and have shown cardiovascular risk reduction similar  to once daily liraglutide. Although, overall semaglutide safety was comparable to  other GLP-1 receptor agonists (low risk of hypoglycemia and high frequency of  gastrointestinal side effects), increase in retinopathy complications requires  further investigation.","2018-03","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","343-351","","3","18","","Expert Opin Biol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29431519","","","","anti-hyperglycemic; Blood Glucose/analysis; Body Weight; Clinical Trials as Topic; Diabetes; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy; GLP-1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/agonists/metabolism; Glucagon-Like Peptides/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; glucose; Glycated Hemoglobin/analysis; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Injections, Subcutaneous; semaglutide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many  therapies for the treatment of T2D but not all are suitable for patients with  comorbidities. Oral semaglutide is a tablet formulation of a glucagon-like  peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and was recently approved for the treatment  of T2D, representing an oral alternative to injectable GLP-1RAs. This article  reviews data from: PIONEER 6, a phase 3a cardiovascular outcomes trial in  patients at high cardiovascular risk; PIONEER 5, a phase 3a trial in patients  with moderate renal impairment; a post-hoc analysis of PIONEER data by age; and  pharmacokinetic trials investigating the effects of renal impairment,  gastrointestinal disease, and hepatic impairment on the exposure of oral  semaglutide. PIONEER 6 demonstrated the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide  compared with placebo (hazard ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57,  1.11; p < 0.001 for noninferiority), ruling out excess cardiovascular risk. In  PIONEER 5, oral semaglutide was superior to placebo in decreasing glycated  hemoglobin over 26 weeks (estimated treatment difference [ETD]: -0.8%; 95% CI:  -1.0, -0.6; p < 0.0001) and body weight (ETD: -2.5 kg; 95% CI: -3.2, -1.8; p  < 0.0001), and renal function was unchanged in both treatment groups. There was  no effect of age on glycemic efficacy of oral semaglutide and the presence of  upper gastrointestinal disease or hepatic impairment did not affect the  pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Across the trials, the safety profile of oral  semaglutide was as expected for a GLP-1RA, with gastrointestinal adverse events  most commonly reported. As such, oral semaglutide provides an effective oral  GLP-1RA treatment option in older patients and/or those with comorbidities, with  no requirements for dose adjustment.","2020-11","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","","","","132","","","","","","","","","England","eng","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1080/00325481.2020.1800286 ISSN: 1941-9260 0032-5481 Issue: sup2 Journal Abbreviation: Postgrad Med Pages: 37-47 Publication Title: Postgraduate medicine PMID: 32815439","","","","Age Factors; Aged; cardiovascular disease; Cardiovascular Diseases/complications; chronic kidney disease; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/agonists; Glucagon-Like Peptides/*administration & dosage; hepatic impairment; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage; Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications; older; Oral semaglutide; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; renal impairment; type 2 diabetes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data Sources: A MEDLINE/PubMed search was  conducted between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2019. Search terms included  semaglutide, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, GLP-1 receptor agonist,  and type 2 diabetes. Study Selection and Data Extraction Quantification: The  following study designs were included in the analysis: systematic review and/or  meta-analyses, clinical trial, or observational study design. Narrative reviews  were excluded. Articles were included only if they were published in the English  language or evaluated oral semaglutide with regard to pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in humans. Data Synthesis: Oral  semaglutide has been Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of  T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Oral semaglutide has been shown to  result in an absolute hemoglobin A(1C) reduction between -0.5% and -1.5% and  weight reductions between -1 and -4.7 kg. Oral semaglutide has been shown to be  noninferior to placebo for cardiovascular (CV) safety although additional CV  outcomes trials are ongoing. Adverse effects appear to be similar to those of  other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and are gastrointestinal in  nature. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Oral semaglutide may be  appropriate as second- or third-line add-on therapy for patients with T2DM who  are not meeting treatment goals on metformin and are overweight and reluctant to  use an injectable drug.

Recent studies  have shown that semaglutide also works on the brain, suggesting its potential  utility for various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's  disease. This study aimed to develop a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of semaglutide in both plasma and brain to  characterize the pharmacokinetics and brain distribution in rats. Semaglutide was  extracted by simple protein precipitation with methanol from plasma and by solid  phase extraction from brain tissue. Liraglutide was used as an internal standard.  Gradient elution profiles with mobile phases comprising 0.1 % formic acid in  water and acetonitrile were used for chromatographic separation. The lower limit  of quantification (LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay was 0.5 ng/mL for both rat plasma  and brain. Intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged 89.20-109.50 % in the plasma and  92.00-105.00 % in the brain. Precision was within 8.92 % in the plasma and 7.94 %  in the brain. Sprague-Dawley rats were given semaglutide by intravenous (IV,  0.02 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) injection. Plasma  concentrations of semaglutide showed a multi-exponential decline with an average  half-life of 7.22-9.26 hr in rats. The subcutaneous bioavailability of  semaglutide was 76.65-82.85 %. The brain tissue to plasma partition coefficient  (K(p)) value of semaglutide was estimated as <0.01. Among the different regions  of the brain, semaglutide concentrations were significantly higher in the  hypothalamus. The analytical method and pharmacokinetic information may be  helpful toward a better understanding of the effect of semaglutide in the brain  and further development of GLP-1 analogs for various brain diseases.","2023-04-15","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","123688","","","1221","","J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

These agents  potentially have the ability to stimulate proliferation or prevent apoptosis of  pancreatic β-cells, induce weight-loss and provide vascular benefits in patients  with T2DM. Newer GLP-1RA, semaglutide has shown a robust reduction in HbA1c up to  1.5 - 1.8%. However, individual differences exist between the different GLP-1RAs,  in terms of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and vascular protection.  The potential of vascular protection offered by newer anti-diabetic agents has  generated a lot of excitement in the field of diabetes, and to a large extent, is  now driving treatment decisions. So far, six cardiovascular outcome trials of  GLP-1 RAs have been published, analyzing lixisenatide (ELIXA), liraglutide  (LEADER), semaglutide (SUSTAIN-6), long-acting exenatide (EXSCEL), dulaglutide  (REWIND), and oral semaglutide (PIONEER 6) with a follow-up duration of 2-4  years. LEADER, REWIND and SUSTAIN-6 trials have demonstrated a reduction in rates  of major adverse cardiovascular events with active GLP-1 RA treatment, but ELIXA,  PIONEER 6 and EXSCEL, have been neutral. In this review, we discuss the available  evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) analyzing the cardiovascular  effects of various GLP-1 RAs with the aim of comparing individual drugs.

Only a few medicines have shown long-term effectiveness in  obesity, and new medicines are urgently needed. AREAS COVERED: A  multiple-ascending dose phase 1b clinical trial of a new drug retatrutide  (LY3437943), which in addition to stimulating Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and  Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, stimulates glucagon  receptors, in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Retatrutide was relatively safe and  pharmacokinetics support once-weekly dosing. EXPERT OPINION: The role of  stimulating glucagon receptors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity  is poorly defined and needs to be clarified. Although retatrutide may be superior  to the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide in reducing plasma glucose and body  weight, this is not a meaningful comparison, as another GLP-1 receptor agonist  (semaglutide) is more potent than dulaglutide at this and may have similar  efficacy to retatrutide. Retatrutide also needs to be compared to another Eli  Lilly and Company drug, the combined GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, tirzepatide.  The safety of retatrutide needs to be determined in larger and longer trials.","2023-05","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","355-359","","5","32","","Expert Opin Investig Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37086147","","","","*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy; *Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Diabetes; dulaglutide; GLP-1 receptors; Glucagon; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/agonists; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use; obesity; Obesity/drug therapy; Receptors, Glucagon; retatrutide; semaglutide; tirzepatide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Achieving and maintaining tight  glycemic control is key to preventing development or progression of CKD; however,  improving glycemic control may be limited by effects of renal impairment on the  efficacy and safety of T2DM treatments, necessitating dosing adjustments and  careful evaluation of contraindications. Understanding the treatment  considerations specific to each class of T2DM medication is important in  individualizing therapy and improving glycemic, renal, and cardiovascular  outcomes. Traditional glucose-lowering treatments include insulin, metformin,  sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones. Each of these agents  exhibits altered pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment except for  the thiazolidinediones, which are metabolized by the liver and do not accumulate  appreciably in patients with renal impairment. Newer glucose-lowering treatments  include GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Of  these, only the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin can be used across all stages of  renal impairment without dosing restrictions or concerns regarding dose  escalation, and all SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated when eGFR  <45 mL/min/1.73m(2). Several of the newer treatments have also been investigated  for effects on renal and cardiovascular outcomes, demonstrating potential  benefits of the GLP-1 agonists liraglutide and semaglutide, as well as the SGLT2  inhibitors canagliflozin and empagliflozin, in reducing risk for some adverse  renal and cardiovascular events. In addition, some DPP-4 inhibitors have been  shown to reduce albuminuria, an indicator of glomerular dysfunction.  Consideration of this information is useful in informing optimal management  strategies for patients with T2DM and concomitant CKD. More clinical data from  future and ongoing clinical trials, including data regarding potential renal and  cardiovascular benefits, will be important in clarifying the safety and efficacy  profiles of each of these agents in patients with CKD.","2018-05","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","381-393","","4","130","","Postgrad Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29667921","","","","*Primary Health Care; albuminuria; Benzamides/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Blood Glucose/metabolism; cardiovascular disease; contraindications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy; Diabetic Nephropathies/etiology/*metabolism; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/agonists; Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism; Humans; hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Insulin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Metformin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Patient Care Planning; pharmacokinetics; Physicians, Primary Care; renal insufficiency; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/etiology/*metabolism; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Sulfonylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Thiazolidinediones/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Pharmacokinetic modelling and simulations of semaglutide  subcutaneous injections were performed using the Transdermal Compartmental  Absorption & Transit model implemented in GastroPlus v.9.5 modules. A PBPK model  of semaglutide was developed and verified in the adult population, by comparing  the simulated plasma exposure with the observed data, and further scaled to the  paediatric populations with normal and obese body weight. RESULTS: The  semaglutide PBPK model was successfully developed in adults and scaled to the  paediatric population. Our paediatric PBPK simulations indicated a significant  increase in maximum plasma concentrations for the 10-14 years' paediatric  population with healthy body weights, which was higher than the observed values  in adults at the reference dose. Since gastrointestinal adverse events are  related to increased semaglutide concentrations, peak concentrations outside the  target range may represent a safety risk for this paediatric age group. Besides,  paediatric PBPK models indicated that body weight was inversely related to  semaglutide maximum plasma concentration, corroborating the consensus on the  influence of body weight on semaglutide PK in adults. CONCLUSION: Paediatric PBPK  was successfully achieved using a top-down approach and drug-related parameters.  The development of unprecedented PBPK models will support paediatric clinical  therapy for applying aid-safe dosing regimens for the paediatric population in  diabetes treatment.","2023-06-09","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","","","","","","Br J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 British Pharmacological Society.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37293836","","","","children; diabetes; PBPK; pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As most lipidated therapeutic peptides are administered by  subcutaneous injection, we have also assessed in vitro their catabolism in the SC  tissue using the LC-HRMS-based SCiMetPep assay. We observed that oligomerization  had a shielding effect against catabolism. At the same time, binding to albumin  may provide only limited protection from proteolysis due to the higher unbound  peptide fraction present in the subcutaneous compartment with respect to the  plasma. Finally, identification of catabolites in rat plasma after SC dosing of  semaglutide showed a good correlation with the in vitro data, with  Tyr(19)-Leu(20) being the major cleavage site. Early characterization of the  complex interplay between oligomerization, albumin binding, and catabolism at the  injection site is essential for the synthesis of lipidated peptides with good  pharmacokinetic profiles.","2022-02-20","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","114566","","","210","","J Pharm Biomed Anal","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluates the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of GZR18, and its potential for  the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In vitro pharmacology and  activity of GZR18 were characterized by a binding assay of GZR18 using human  serum albumin (HSA), an activation assay in human GLP-1 receptor-expressing cell  lines, and its effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in primary  mice islets. Pharmacokinetic profiling was performed in Sprague Dawley rats and  cynomolgus monkeys, and efficacy evaluated using GZR18 single or repeated doses  in db/db mice. GZR18 showed similar binding affinity for HSA and GLP-1 receptor  compared with semaglutide and liraglutide. GZR18 increased GSIS, which was  confirmed by dynamic islet perifusion and fluorescence imaging using PKZnR-5 for  real-time detection. In cynomolgus monkeys, the average GZR18 maximal  concentration was 527 nmol L(-1), the terminal half-life (T(1/2)) was 61.3 h, and  the time to maximum concentration was 14 h. Single-dose GZR18 lowered blood  glucose levels and reduced body weight over 72 h in db/db mice. GZR18 successive  administration (every three days for 33 days, i.e. 11 doses) lowered nonfasting  and fasting blood glucose levels (p < 0.05 versus control) and glycated  hemoglobin, following the 11th dose. Food and water consumption in db/db mice was  lowered following repeated doses of GZR18 (p < 0.05 versus control), without a  reduction in body weight. These results demonstrate the potential of GZR18 as a  long-acting GLP-1 analog for the treatment of T2DM.","2022-08-05","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","175107","","","928","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This suite of activities  makes GLP-1 and its analogs an attractive choice for treating type 2 diabetes  mellitus in the context of overweight or obesity. This study used different types  and lengths of fatty acids to design dual fatty acid side chains for GLP-1  receptor agonists including decanoic, dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic,  dodecanedioic, tetradecanedioic, hexadecanedioic, and octadecanedioic acids.  Sixteen GLP-1 receptor agonists (conjugates 13-28) with dual fatty acid side  chains were obtained by liquid-phase synthesis. After structural confirmation  using high-resolution mass spectrometry, peptide mapping, and circular dichroism,  the biological activities of the conjugates were screened. First, the conjugates  were screened for albumin binding and activity in GLP-1R-CRE-bla CHO-K1 cells.  Albumin binding results suggested a synergistic effect between the two fatty  acids in the conjugates. Next, conjugates 18, 19, and 21 selected after primary  screening were assessed for receptor affinity, activity in INS-1 cells, plasma  stability across different species, and efficacy and pharmacokinetics in normal  and db/db mice. One candidate (conjugate 19) was found to have albumin binding of  >99 %, good receptor affinity, activities of INS-1 cells, and plasma stability.

However, the effect of C10 on  the intestinal absorption of peptides with different physicochemical properties  and its permeation-enhancing effect in vivo remains to be understood. Here, we  evaluated the effects of C10 on intestinal absorption in rats with a  glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1  (GIP-GLP1) dual agonist peptide (LY) and semaglutide with different enzymatic  stabilities and self-association behaviors as well as the oral exposure of the LY  peptide in minipigs. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism of action (MoA)  of C10 for improving the intestinal absorption of the LY peptide in vivo via live  imaging of the rat intestinal epithelium and tissue distribution of the LY  peptide in minipigs. The LY peptide showed higher proteolytic stability in  pancreatin and was a monomer in solution compared to that in semaglutide. C10  increased in vitro permeability in the minipig intestinal organoid monolayer to a  greater extent for the LY peptide than for semaglutide. In the rat jejunal  closed-loop model, C10 increased the absorption of LY peptide better than that of  semaglutide, which might be attributed to higher in vitro proteolytic stability  and permeability of the LY peptide. Using confocal live imaging, we observed that  C10 enabled the rapid oral absorption of a model macromolecule (FD4) in the rat  intestine. In the duodenum tissues of minipigs, C10 was found to qualitatively  reduce the tight junction protein level and allow peptide uptake to the  intestinal cells. C10 decreased the transition temperature of the artificial  lipid membrane, indicating an increase in membrane fluidity, which is consistent  with the above in vivo imaging results. These data indicated that the LY's  favorable physicochemical properties combined with the effects of C10 on the  intestinal mucosa resulted in an ∼2% relative bioavailability in minipigs.","2023-02-06","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","929-941","","2","20","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36592951","","","","*Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide/metabolism/pharmacology; *Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/metabolism; Animals; Decanoic Acids/pharmacology; intestinal absorption; Intestinal Absorption; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; intestinal tissue distribution; oral peptide delivery; Peptides/metabolism; physicochemical properties; Rats; sodium caprate; Swine; Swine, Miniature/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Catabolism at the injection site can be a specific and major  degradation pathway for many SC administered peptides. In some cases, it can  significantly affect pharmacokinetics, particularly bioavailability, and have  detrimental effects on the efficacy of the drug. This work describes a liquid  chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry based in vitro assay to assess  peptide metabolism in the SC tissue (SCiMetPep assay). The SCiMetPep assay was  developed using human, Sprague-Dawley rat and Göttingen minipig SC tissue  homogenate supernatant, and allows for both determination of degradation rate  (half-life) of the parent peptide and identification of metabolites generated  from enzymatic proteolysis. The assay was developed and validated using known  peptides including human insulin and four GLP-1 analogues (lixisenatide,  exenatide, liraglutide and semaglutide). Different experimental parameters were  evaluated in order to optimize the homogenization process of the SC tissue and  the peptide incubation conditions. In vitro metabolism of these peptides was in  good agreement with in vivo data reported in the literature. Finally, when  SCiMetPep assay was applied on a series of structurally related peptides, a  fairly good correlation was found between SC metabolic stability and  bioavailability, suggesting that catabolism at the injection site can have a  major role in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of  peptide therapeutics. The SCiMetPep showed the ability to identify analogs with  improved SC metabolic stability and hence higher bioavailability. The assay can  be used in the early phases of drug discovery to identify peptide metabolic soft  spots at the injection site and guide the peptide drug discovery process.","2018-09-10","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","449-458","","","159","","J Pharm Biomed Anal","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The studies also revealed that the  absorption-enhancing ability of D-octaarginine-linked PNVA-co-AA for exendin-4  was statistically equivalent to that of sodium salcaprozate (SNAC), which is an  absorption enhancer formulated in tablets of semaglutide approved recently as an  orally available GLP-1 analogue. From a perspective of clinical application of  our technology, we have separately developed hyaluronic acid modified with  L-octaarginine via a tetraglycine spacer which would be degraded in biological  conditions. The present study revealed that tetraglycine-L-octaarginine-linked  hyaluronic acid enhanced nasal absorption of exendin-4 in mice, as did  D-octaarginine-linked PNVA-co-AA. There was no significant difference in  absorption-enhancing abilities between the hyaluronic acid derivative and SNAC  when octreotide (Mw: ca. 1.0 kDa, pI: 8.3) and lixisenatide (Mw: ca. 4.9 kDa, pI:  9.5) were used as a model protein drug. On the other hand, SNAC did not  significantly enhance nasal absorption of somatropin (Mw: ca. 22.1 kDa, pI: 5.3)  when compared with absorption enhancer-free conditions. Substitution of SNAC with  tetraglycine-L-octaarginine-linked hyaluronic acid resulted in a 5-fold increase  in absolute bioavailability of somatropin with statistical significance. It  appeared that pI hardly ever influenced absorption-enhancing abilities of both  enhancers. Results indicated that our polysaccharide derivative would be a  promising absorption enhancer which delivers biologics applied on the nasal  mucosa into systemic circulation and was of greater advantage than SNAC for  enhancing nasal absorption of protein drugs with a larger Mw.","2020-09","2023-07-17 11:18:56","2023-07-17 11:18:56","","186-194","","","154","","Eur J Pharm Biopharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.
