METHODS: Healthy subjects (N = 42) were randomized to receive  saxagliptin 5 mg alone, dapagliflozin 10 mg alone, or saxagliptin 5 mg plus  dapagliflozin 10 mg coadministered; there was a washout period of ≥6 days between  treatments. Serial blood samples for determining saxagliptin, 5-hydroxy  saxagliptin (5-OH saxagliptin; major active metabolite) and dapagliflozin plasma  concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters were collected before and up to 60  hours after the dose. No interaction was to be concluded if the 90% CIs for the  geometric mean ratios of the combination compared with each drug given alone for  Cmax and AUCinf were within 0.80 to 1.25. FINDINGS: The results indicated that  dapagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of saxagliptin,  5-OH saxagliptin, or saxagliptin total active moiety and vice versa. The 90% CIs  for Cmax and AUCinf for all comparisons were contained entirely within the 0.80  to 1.25 equivalence intervals. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (apparent oral  clearance or half-life) of saxagliptin or dapagliflozin were similar when each  medicine was administered alone or when coadministered. No safety profile or  tolerability findings of concern were observed during the study. All adverse  events were mild, and no serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS:  These data indicate that coadministration of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin  exhibits no pharmacokinetic interaction and is well tolerated.

METHODS: Patients were randomized to a single oral dose  of dapagliflozin 2.5, 5 or 10 mg. The PK characteristics for individual patients  were derived by non-compartmental methods. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE),  fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and ease of swallowing were also evaluated. RESULTS:  A total of 24 patients with a mean (range) body weight of 99.7 (61.5-169.5) kg  received dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed after oral  administration (median time to maximum plasma concentration ∼1.5 h) and systemic  exposures to dapagliflozin and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite appeared  dose-proportional. The mean 24-h UGE increased in a dose-related manner (52.8,  62.4 and 89.0 g for the 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively). Mean FPG  concentrations were lower for all dose groups on day 2 (6.9, 6.2 and 6.8 mmol/l  for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively) than they were predose on day 1 (9.5,  8.5 and 8.2 mmol/l for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively). Six patients (25%)  experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), however, there was no dose-related pattern.  All AEs occurred only once and most were mild in intensity. Nearly all patients  (n = 23; 95.8%) reported easy swallowing of the dapagliflozin tablets.  CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was well tolerated in this paediatric population, with  no significant safety findings. PK/PD characteristics were similar to those  observed in adults with T2DM, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the same  dapagliflozin dosage as that used in adults can be evaluated in future phase III  paediatric studies.","2016-07","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:47:47","","678-684","","7","18","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27291448","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; pharmacokinetics; Area Under Curve; Treatment Outcome; Drug Administration Schedule; Child; Benzhydryl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Blood Glucose/metabolism; type 2 diabetes mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy; Patient Satisfaction; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics; paediatric; Glucosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; dapagliflozin; Sodium-Glucose Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dapagliflozin elimination is primarily via glucuronidation to an  inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. Pharmacokinetic studies are  recommended in subjects with impaired hepatic function if hepatic metabolism  accounts for a substantial portion of the absorbed drug. OBJECTIVE: The purpose  of our study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in patients  with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (HI) with healthy subjects.  METHODS: This was an open-label, parallel-group study in male or female patients  with mild, moderate, or severe HI (6 per group according to Child-Pugh  classification) and in 6 healthy control subjects. The control subjects were  matched to the combined HI group for age (±10 years), weight (±20%), sex, and  smoking status, with no deviations from normal in medical history, physical  examination, ECG, or laboratory determinations. All participants received a  single 10-mg oral dose of dapagliflozin, and the pharmacokinetics of  dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide were characterized. Dapagliflozin  tolerability was also assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Demographic  characteristics and baseline physical measurements (weight, height, and body mass  index) were similar among the 18 patients in the HI groups (58-126 kg;  151.2-190.0 cm, and 31.5-37.7 kg/m(2), respectively) and the healthy subject  group (65.0-102.6 kg; 166.0-184.0 cm, and 23.3-34.3 kg/m(2), respectively). In  those with mild, moderate, or severe HI, dapagliflozin mean C(max) values were  12% lower and 12% and 40% higher than healthy subjects, respectively. Mean  dapagliflozin AUC(0-∞) values were 3%, 36%, and 67% higher compared with healthy  subjects, respectively. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide mean C(max) values were 4%  and 58% higher and 14% lower in those with mild, moderate, or severe HI compared  with healthy subjects, respectively, and mean dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide  AUC(0-∞) values were 6%, 100%, and 30% higher compared with healthy subjects,  respectively. These values were highly dependent on the calculated creatinine  clearance of each group. All adverse events were mild or moderate, with no  imbalance in frequency between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy  subjects, systemic exposure to dapagliflozin in subjects with HI was correlated  with the degree of HI. Single 10-mg doses of dapagliflozin were generally well  tolerated by participants in this study. Due to the higher dapagliflozin  exposures in patients with severe HI, the benefit:risk ratio should be  individually assessed because the long-term safety profile and efficacy of  dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied in this population.","2011-11","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:44:47","","1798-1808","","11","33","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

The preclinical characterization of dapagliflozin,  to allow compound selection and prediction of pharmacological and dispositional  behavior in the clinic, involved Caco-2 cell permeability studies, cytochrome  P450 (P450) inhibition and induction studies, P450 reaction phenotyping,  metabolite identification in hepatocytes, and pharmacokinetics in rats, dogs, and  monkeys. Dapagliflozin was found to have good permeability across Caco-2 cell  membranes. It was found to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not a  significant P-gp inhibitor. Dapagliflozin was not found to be an inhibitor or an  inducer of human P450 enzymes. The in vitro metabolic profiles of dapagliflozin  after incubation with hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans were  qualitatively similar. Rat hepatocyte incubations showed the highest turnover,  and dapagliflozin was most stable in human hepatocytes. Prominent in vitro  metabolic pathways observed were glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and  O-deethylation.

Dapagliflozin reduces hyperglycemia by  inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption and dose-dependently increasing urinary  glucose excretion, independent of insulin secretion or action. OBJECTIVES: These  studies assessed the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic and pharmaco  dynamic properties of dapagliflozin and its major inactive metabolite,  dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), in healthy subjects residing in China.  METHODS: In 2 identically designed, open-label, single- and multiple-dose studies  (n = 14 for both studies), healthy Chinese subjects were administered oral  dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg. In both studies, subjects received a single dose on day  1 (single-dose administration period) followed by 6 once-daily doses on days 5 to  10 (multiple-dose administration period). Pharmacokinetic parameters (plasma and  urinary dapagliflozin and D3OG), pharmacodynamic response (urinary glucose  excretion), and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed  the dapagliflozin 5-mg study, and 13 completed the dapagliflozin 10-mg study.  Baseline characteristics were balanced across the two studies: 9 versus 10 men;  mean age, 27.1 versus 28.9 years; mean weight, 62.8 versus 62.2 kg; and mean body  mass index, 23.0 versus 22.2 kg/m(2) in the dapagliflozin 5- and 10-mg studies,  respectively. In both doses, dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed (T(max), ≤1.5 h),  accumulation (defined as the geometric mean ratio of AUC(τ) at day 10 to AUC(τ)  at day 1) after multiple dosing was minimal (<1.13 fold), and elimination  half-life was 10 to 12 h. D3OG showed a slightly longer median Tmax (≤2 h) but a  similar plasma concentration-time profile and half-life compared with  dapagliflozin. The majority of D3OG (up to 69.7% of the dapagliflozin dose) was  excreted in urine, while ≤1.9% of dapagliflozin was excreted unchanged in urine.  Over a 24-hour period and at steady state (day 10), urinary glucose excretion  values were 28.1 and 41.1 g with dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively.  Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated; one dapagliflozin 10 mg-treated  subject discontinued the study because of a serious adverse event (bronchitis)  considered by the investigator as unrelated to dapagliflozin dosing. CONCLUSIONS:  Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics following single- and  multiple-dose dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg oral administration in healthy Chinese  subjects were as predicted from previous studies and were similar to findings  observed in non-Chinese healthy subjects. Dapagliflozin dosing was well  tolerated. The clinically recommended dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg once daily is  expected to be appropriate in patients of Chinese ethnicity; results from an  efficacy and tolerability study in Chinese patients with T2DM are awaited.","2013-08","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:48:16","","1211-1222.e2","","8","35","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

METHODS: Steady-state pharmacokinetics and  pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin (1-100 mg) were evaluated in a meta-analysis of  patients with T1DM or T2DM. A model was constructed of the relationship between  dapagliflozin systemic exposure and urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients  with T1DM versus those with T2DM. RESULTS: Data were analysed from 160 patients  (T1DM, n = 70; T2DM, n = 90). Dapagliflozin systemic exposure (maximum  concentration and area under the curve) increased similarly in a dose-related  manner in both patient populations. Dose-dependent increases in 24-h UGE were  observed with dapagliflozin in both populations. Unadjusted results showed that  with regard to UGE response, dapagliflozin was more potent in patients with T1DM  {mean half-maximum effective concentration [EC50 ] = 2.72 ng/ml [95% confidence  interval (CI) 1.14, 5.08]} than in patients with T2DM [EC50  = 12.2 ng/ml (95% CI  4.91, 21.1)].

DAPA reduced  mean insulin dose by 13.6% ( P  < .0001 by ANOVA) and increased urinary glucose  excretion by 610% (143.4 vs 22.4 g/24 h; P  < .0001), both irrespective of  baseline HbA1c. Six independent episodes in 6 patients with plasma  ß-hydroxybutyrate levels between ≥0.6 and <1.0 mmol/L were observed after liquid  meal challenges, 5 episodes in the DAPA group and 1 in the placebo group. This  study provides a proof-of-concept, irrespective of preexisting HbA1c levels, for  adjunct SGLT2-inhibitor therapy in the paediatric age group by lowering insulin  dose and increasing glucose excretion.","2017-11","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:44:04","","1635-1639","","11","19","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28417527","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Double-Blind Method; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Cross-Over Studies; Young Adult; Child; Pilot Projects; Drug Therapy, Combination; HbA1c; type 1 diabetes; hypoglycemia; Insulin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; dapagliflozin; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid/*blood; Benzhydryl Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood/complications/*drug therapy/urine; diabetic ketoacidosis; Glucosides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Glycated Hemoglobin/drug effects/*metabolism; Glycosuria/*chemically induced/epidemiology; insulin requirement; SGLT-2 inhibitor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  study aimed to evaluate the effect of the coadministration of lobeglitazone and  dapagliflozin on their individual pharmacokinetic properties at steady state in  healthy male volunteers in the fasted state. METHODS: This study consisted of 2  parts, each of which was a randomized, open-labeled, multiple-dose, 2-way  crossover study in 20 healthy male volunteers in each part. Blood samples were  taken periodically over a 48-h period after dosing to derive total plasma  lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin pharmacokinetic properties; safety profile was  evaluated throughout the study. FINDINGS: When the pharmacokinetic properties of  dapagliflozin were evaluated following its administration alone and in  combination with lobeglitazone, point estimate and 90% CI of the geometric mean  ratio of dapagliflozin AUC(τ) were entirely within the conventional  bioequivalence range of 80%-125%. However, although it was not clinically  meaningful, its C(ss,max) was ~8% lower in subjects receiving multiple doses of  dapagliflozin and lobeglitazone than that in those administered dapagliflozin  alone. The pharmacokinetic properties of lobeglitazone were evaluated following  its administration alone and in combination with dapagliflozin. The geometric  mean ratios and 90% CIs of the lobeglitazone C(ss,max) and AUC(τ) were within the  conventional bioequivalence range of 80%-125%. IMPLICATIONS: Coadministration of  lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin had no apparent clinically relevant effects on  the pharmacokinetic properties of either drug.

Dapagliflozin is primarily  metabolized via the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 pathway  to its major inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. The aim of this  study was to evaluate the potential for drug-drug interaction between  dapagliflozin and two potential UGT1A9 modulators. METHODS: The results of two  open-label, non-randomized, single-sequence studies are reported in which the  effects of rifampin (a pleiotropic drug-metabolizing enzyme inducer; study 1) and  mefenamic acid (a strong UGT1A9 inhibitor; study 2) were evaluated on the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (assessed by urinary glucose excretion  [UGE]) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects. In study 1, 14 subjects received  single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg alone and in the presence of rifampin 600 mg  QD (6 days). In study 2, 16 subjects received single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg  alone and in the presence of mefenamic acid 250 mg q6h (5 days). RESULTS:  Rifampin reduced total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from  time 0 to infinity [AUC0-inf]) to dapagliflozin by 22% and mefenamic acid  increased dapagliflozin AUC0-inf by 51%. No clinically meaningful effect of  rifampin or mefenamic acid on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin or on  dapagliflozin-mediated urinary glucose excretion was observed.

Dapagliflozin/metformin extended-release (XR) fixed-dose combination (FDC)  tablets offer the convenience of once-daily dosing. Two pharmacokinetic (PK)  studies were conducted to establish bioequivalence for 2 doses of  dapagliflozin/metformin XR FDC versus the same dosage of the individual component  (IC) tablets in healthy adults. METHODS: Two open-label, randomized, 4-period,  4-arm crossover studies were conducted to assess the bioequivalence and PK  properties of dapagliflozin and metformin FDCs in healthy subjects under fed and  fasting conditions. Participants received single oral doses or once-daily dosing  of dapagliflozin/metformin XR (5 mg/500 mg [study 1] or 10 mg/1000 mg [study 2])  for 4 days in an FDC formulation or corresponding strengths of IC tablets.  FINDINGS: For both of the studies, dapagliflozin and metformin 5 mg/500 mg or 10  mg/1000 mg FDC tablets were bioequivalent to the respective IC tablets. The 90%  CIs of the ratio of the adjusted geometric means for all key PK parameters (Cmax,  AUC0-T, and AUC0-∞) were contained within the predefined 0.80 to 1.25 range to  conclude bioequivalence for both dapagliflozin and metformin. Once-daily dosing  to steady state of each FDC tablet had no effect on the PK properties of  dapagliflozin or metformin. When the FDCs were administered with a light-fat  meal, there was no effect on metformin PK values and only a modest, nonclinically  meaningful effect on dapagliflozin PK values. There were no safety or  tolerability concerns. IMPLICATIONS: Bioequivalence of the FDCs of  dapagliflozin/metformin XR and the ICs was established, and no safety issues of  clinical concern were raised.","2015-07-01","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:44:10","","1517-1528","","7","37","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

METHODS: Animal PK/PD properties of janagliflozin were obtained from  preclinical in vivo and in vitro study. Pharmacologically effective level of same  class SGLT2 inhibitors were assessed through preclinical and clinical efficacy  data of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. Human PK parameters and  profiles of janagliflozin were predicted by various methods such as allometric  scaling (AS), dedrick and PK/PD modeling analysis. Mechanistic PK/PD model was  developed to describe janagliflozin-mediated impact on urinary glucose excretion  (UGE). Human IC(50) was scaled from rat model-estimated IC(50) by correcting  interspecies difference of in vitro IC(50) and plasma f(u) of rat and human. The  quantitative PK/PD prediction of janagliflozin was evaluated via observed PK/PD  profiles of healthy subjects. Predicted PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin  were applied in FIH dose design. Optimal starting dose was suggested by  considering preclinical PD and toxicity data of janagliflozin. Effective dose was  suggested by considering pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs.  RESULTS: PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin in preclinical species were  summarized.

In  the present study, the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacologic  properties of all six SGLT2 inhibitors commercially available in Japan were  investigated and compared. Based on findings in normal and diabetic mice, the six  drugs were classified into two categories, long-acting: ipragliflozin and  dapagliflozin, and intermediate-acting: tofogliflozin, canagliflozin,  empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin. Long-acting SGLT2 inhibitors exerted an  antihyperglycemic effect with lower variability of blood glucose level via a  long-lasting increase in urinary glucose excretion. In addition, ipragliflozin  and luseogliflozin exhibited superiority over the others with respect to fast  onset of pharmacological effect. Duration and onset of the pharmacologic effects  seemed to be closely correlated with the pharmacokinetic properties of each SGLT2  inhibitor, particularly with respect to high distribution and long retention in  the target organ, the kidney. While all six SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly  effective in increasing urinary glucose excretion and reducing hyperglycemia, our  findings suggest that variation in the quality of daily blood glucose control  associated with duration and onset of pharmacologic effects of each SGLT2  inhibitor might cause slight differences in rates of improvement in type 2  diabetes.","2016-03","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:47:09","","159-169","","3","130","","J Pharmacol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Japanese Pharmacological Society.

Dapagliflozin promotes glucosuria by inhibiting the renal  sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 transporter. The initial OEL for dapagliflozin  (0.002mg/m(3)) was calculated when low dose clinical data was not available to  identify a NOEL resulting in the need to use excessive UFs. To reduce the UFs  from the OEL, a clinical pharmacodynamic [glucosuria and urinary glucose dipstick  (UGD)] and pharmacokinetic study was conducted with single oral doses of 0.001,  0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 2.5mg administered to 36 healthy subjects. Dose-related  dapagliflozin systemic exposures were observed at doses ⩾0.1mg and glucosuria was  observed at doses ⩾0.3mg and corroborated by UGD. The NOEL was therefore 0.1mg  for glucosuria. For setting the new OEL, no UFs were required. Dividing the POD  by 10m(3) (the volume of air an adult inhales in a workday), the resulting OEL  was 0.01mg/m(3). In conclusion, low-dose clinical pharmacodynamic and  pharmacokinetic data can allow the OEL to be adjusted to the highest safe level.","2013-10","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:44:27","","89-97","","1","67","","Regul Toxicol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The present work describes concurrent  estimation of metformin (MET) and three sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2)  inhibitors namely canagliflozin (CANA), dapagliflozin (DAPA) and empagliflozin  (EMPA) in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS). Sample clean-up was optimized using ion-pair solid-phase extraction  with sodium lauryl sulphate on Strata-X extraction cartridges. Consistent  recoveries were obtained by critically optimizing parameters such as washing and  elution solvents during extraction. The extraction recovery ranged from 79 to 88%  for all the analytes. Chromatographic separation were accomplished on a Cyano  (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column within 5.0 min using acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium  formate buffer (75:25, v/v) as the mobile phase. The resolution factors between  MET-EMPA, MET-DAPA, MET-CANA, DAPA-EMPA and CANA-DAPA were 4.92, 5.85, 7.13, 1.01  and 1.44, respectively.

This study evaluated the  bioequivalence and safety of 2 dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin  extended-release (XR) FCDPs relative to their ICs: saxagliptin and  dapagliflozin/metformin XR. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, single-dose,  single-center crossover study was conducted in 84 healthy subjects aged 18-55  years. The primary objective was to evaluate the fed-state bioequivalence of a  dapagliflozin 5-mg/saxagliptin 2.5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP and a  dapagliflozin 10-mg/saxagliptin 5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP relative to the  ICs. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the effect of food on the  pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of saxagliptin, dapagliflozin, and metformin in  both FCDPs and characterization of the PK parameters of the active metabolite of  saxagliptin, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, in healthy subjects. PK parameters (AUC(0-∞),  AUC(0-t), and C(max)) were used to assess the bioequivalence of the 2 FCDPs with  their ICs. The C(max) and AUC(0-t) of the study drugs were compared between  female and male subjects to assess sex differences in exposure. Safety and  tolerability of both FCDPs and ICs were also assessed with adverse events, vital  signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate), 12-lead ECG,  physical examinations, and laboratory assessments. FINDINGS: Both  dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin XR FCDPs were bioequivalent to their ICs. For  the dapagliflozin 5-mg/saxagliptin 2.5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP, the 90% CI  for the geometric mean ratio of dapagliflozin C(max) was slightly above the  80%-125% bioequivalence limit, which is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Food  delayed the absorption of the study drugs in both FCDPs, which is unlikely to  have a clinically relevant impact on efficacy. In both cohorts, exposure was  higher in female subjects compared with male subjects, potentially due to the  lower body weight of the female subjects. The safety profile and tolerability of  the FCDPs were similar to those of their ICs, and no deaths or serious adverse  events were reported.

METHODS: Patients (glycated hemoglobin, 8 to 12%; 64 to 108 mmol/mol) were  randomized to 24-week, double-blind treatment with saxagliptin 5 mg/day plus  dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (n = 179), saxagliptin 5 mg/day plus placebo (n = 176),  or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus placebo (n = 179) added to metformin. C-peptide  to insulin ratio was used as an index of insulin clearance during a meal  tolerance test, and β-cell function was evaluated by Homeostasis Model Assessment  2. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, compared with baseline, saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and  saxagliptin + placebo increased mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) C-peptide  area under the curve (AUC(0-180 min)) (40.2 [9.2 to 71.3] ng/mL and 95.4 [63.4 to  127.4] ng/mL, respectively); no change was noted with dapagliflozin + placebo  (14.5 [-17.6 to 46.8] ng/mL). Insulin AUC was reduced from baseline with  saxagliptin + dapagliflozin (-1,120.4 [-1,633.9 to -606.9] μU/mL) and  dapagliflozin + placebo (-1,018.6 [-1550.5 to -486.8] μU/mL) but increased with  saxagliptin + placebo (661.2 [131.1 to 1,191.3] μU/mL). C-peptide to insulin  ratio did not change versus baseline with saxagliptin + placebo but increased  after saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo, largely due to  decreased insulin AUC with dapagliflozin. All treatments improved β-cell function  (mean change [95% CI] from baseline, saxagliptin+dapagliflozin: 20.6% [16.5% to  24.8%]; dapagliflozin + placebo: 17.0% [12.7% to 21.4%]; saxagliptin + placebo:  11.0% [6.6% to 15.5%]). CONCLUSION: Increased C-peptide to insulin ratio with  saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo add-on to metformin  compared with saxagliptin + placebo add-on to metformin suggests that  dapagliflozin increases insulin clearance and may contribute to lower circulating  insulin.

The sodium-glucose  cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), present in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule, is  responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce  glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion. In animal models and  humans with type 2 diabetes, this effect is associated with reduced fasting and  postprandial blood glucose levels, and reduced hemoglobin A1c. Animal studies  suggest that reduction of hyperglycemia with SGLT2 inhibitors may also improve  insulin sensitivity and preserve β-cell function. Urinary excretion of excess  calories with SGLT2 inhibitors is also associated with reduction in body weight.  Modest reductions in blood pressure have been noted with SGLT2 inhibitors,  consistent with a mild diuretic action. Some C-glucoside SGLT2 inhibitors, such  as dapagliflozin, have pharmacokinetic properties that make them amenable to  once-daily dosing.","2011-03","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:46:08","","S20-27","","120","","","Kidney Int Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21358698","","","","Humans; Animals; Insulin Resistance; Glucose/*metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy; Insulin-Secreting Cells/drug effects; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/metabolism; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AREAS  COVERED: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze the  pharmacokinetic characteristics, toxicological issues and safety concerns of  SGLT2 inhibitors in humans. This review focuses on three compounds  (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) with results obtained in healthy  volunteers (including drug-drug interactions), patients with T2DM (single dose  and multiple doses) and special populations (those with renal or hepatic  impairment). EXPERT OPINION: The three pharmacological agents share an excellent  oral bioavailability, long half-life allowing once-daily administration, low  accumulation index and renal clearance, the absence of active metabolites and a  limited propensity to drug-drug interactions. No clinically relevant changes in  pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in T2DM patients or in patients with  mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Adverse events are a slightly  increased incidence of mycotic genital and rare benign urinary infections. SGLT2  inhibitors have the potential to reduce several cardiovascular risk factors, and  cardiovascular outcome trials are currently ongoing. The best positioning of  SGLT2 inhibitors in the armamentarium for treating T2DM is still a matter of  debate.","2014-05","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:46:20","","647-663","","5","10","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24387329","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Renal Insufficiency/complications; Diabetic Nephropathies/complications; Canagliflozin; Hepatic Insufficiency/complications; Benzhydryl Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Glucosides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Membrane Transport Modulators/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Thiophenes/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to  assess the bioequivalence and tolerability of 2 FDCs of dapagliflozin and  metformin extended-release (XR) versus their individual component (IC) tablets.  METHODS: An open-label, balanced, randomized, 2-way crossover, 4-arm study was  conducted in 129 healthy Brazilian subjects (aged 18-55 years). Two oral doses of  the FDCs (5 mg dapagliflozin and 500 mg metformin XR, and 10 mg dapagliflozin and  1000 mg metformin XR) were evaluated in fed and fasted states. FINDINGS: Under  fed and fasted conditions the 5 mg dapagliflozin and 500 mg metformin XR FDC  showed bioequivalence to its ICs. The 10 mg dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin  XR FDC was bioequivalent to its ICs in fed subjects. Although AUC for the 10 mg  dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin XR FDC was bioequivalent in fasted subjects,  the Cmax for metformin was not bioequivalent to its ICs in fasted subjects (upper  90% CI was 127.5%, and thus outside the 80%-125% bioequivalence interval). The  small increase in the fasted state is not considered clinically meaningful due to  the small magnitude of the difference (9.2%), the lack of metformin Cmax being  associated with efficacy or tolerability concerns, and the fasted state not being  the recommended state for dosing of metformin XR. The safety profile and  tolerability of the FDCs were similar to those of their ICs and no deaths or  serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: Both FDCs of dapagliflozin  and metformin XR were bioequivalent to their ICs in fed and fasted subjects,  except for the metformin Cmax from the 10 mg dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin  XR FDC in fasted subjects.

An early toxicological assessment indicated that 10b (also codified as  ACH-000143) was devoid of hERG binding, genotoxicity, and behavioral alterations  at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o., supporting further investigation of this compound  as a drug candidate.","2021-02-25","2024-04-23 08:32:30","2024-04-23 08:44:24","","1904-1929","","4","64","","J Med Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 33626870","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Mice; Rats, Wistar; Structure-Activity Relationship; Molecular Structure; Drug Design; Triglycerides/metabolism; Liver/pathology; Diet, High-Fat; Fatty Liver/*drug therapy/pathology; Obesity/drug therapy; Acetamides/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Anti-Obesity Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Benzhydryl Compounds/pharmacology; Benzimidazoles/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Glucosides/pharmacology; Receptor, Melatonin, MT1/*agonists; Receptor, Melatonin, MT2/*agonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As this condition inexorably progresses to demanding KRT, drug withdrawal is  supported by the current lack of evidence of safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in  dialysis. METHODS: This study was a prospective, single-center, open-label trial  ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05343078 ) aimed at assessing the  pharmacokinetic properties and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with kidney  failure on regular dialysis regimens compared with those with type 2 diabetes and  age- and sex-matched controls with normal kidney function. Peripheral blood  samples were collected from both groups every 30 minutes for 4 hours and again  after 48 hours after ingestion of dapagliflozin 10 mg, which occurred immediately  before dialysis session initiation in the kidney failure group. This protocol  occurred in drug-naïve patients and again after six daily doses of dapagliflozin  to assess whether the drug had accumulated. The plasma and dialysate levels of  dapagliflozin at each time point were determined by liquid chromatography and  used to calculate pharmacokinetics parameters (peak concentration [C max ] and  area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve) for each participant.  RESULTS: Dapagliflozin C max was 117 and 97.6 ng/ml in the kidney failure and  control groups, respectively, whereas the corresponding accumulation ratios were  26.7% and 9.5%. No serious adverse events were reported for either group.  Dapagliflozin recovered from dialysate corresponded to 0.10% of the administered  dose. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with kidney failure on dialysis, dapagliflozin was  well tolerated, was slightly dialyzable, and had nonaccumulating pharmacokinetic  properties.

Some of the therapeutic strategies are  contraindicated in patients with concomitant heart disease. However, the newest  antidiabetic medications, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have  shown to significantly reduce CV mortality and heart failure (HF)  hospitalizations. The mechanism behind these surprising cardiac benefits remains  unclear. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacokinetic,  pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety data for the different SGLT2 inhibitors.  Specific attention is devoted to the postulated mechanisms of action for their  benefit. The therapeutic efficacy and potential use in different indications  outside T2DM such as HF, T1DM, and renal disease are also discussed. Expert  opinion: SGLT2 inhibitors have an excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  profile. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are a safe and efficacious treatment  option for T2DM. Given their cardiac benefits (reduction in HF and death) and the  low incidence of adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors are being currently studied as  a treatment for HF also in nondiabetic individuals. These agents seem to  represent a shift in the treatment of HF patients regardless their glycemic  profile.","2018-12","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","1287-1302","","12","14","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30463454","","","","Humans; Animals; pharmacokinetics; type 2 diabetes mellitus; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; pharmacodynamics; heart failure; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Heart Failure/drug therapy/physiopathology; Canagliflozin; empagliflozin; dapagliflozin; SGLT2 inhibitors; Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/mortality/prevention & control; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2/*drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Expert  commentary: Conclusions drawn from clinical trials investigating combination with  the separate drugs are considered to apply to the fixed-dose combination (FDC)  that demonstrates bioequivalence. Dual saxagliptin/dapagliflozin therapy is more  potent than either monotherapy and can be used as an initial combination or a  stepwise sequential approach. Dual therapy is generally well tolerated and may be  used in special populations, with some limitations because of the presence of  dapagliflozin.

However, these two cocrystals exhibited different melting points and  crystalline structures, indicating their different cocrystal forms. Moreover,  DPF-LPC exhibited less hygroscopicity and lower water content than DPF-PDHC.

Moreover, it provided lower impurities than the commercial tablet,  indicating its better stability. In the two animals, there were no significant  differences in the plasma concentrations, AUC, C(max), and T(max) values,  suggesting that they were bioequivalent.

Satisfactory management of  glycemic control in patients afflicted with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  remains a major clinical challenge. Identification of potential pharmacological  target sites is therefore continuing as an integral part of the diabetic  research. The sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) expressed in the renal  proximal tubule plays an essential role in glucose reabsorption. Pharmacological  blockade of SGLT2 prevents glucose reabsorption and subsequently induces the  elimination of filtered glucose via urine, the process is known as 'glucuresis'.  Dapagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of SGLT2. The US FDA approved  dapagliflozin in January 2014 to improve glycemic control along with diet and  exercise in adult patients afflicted with T2DM. It has a potential to decrease  glycated hemoglobin and to promote weight loss. Although the mechanism of action  of dapagliflozin is not directly linked with insulin or insulin sensitivity,  reduction of plasma glucose by dapagliflozin via induction of glucosuria could  improve muscle insulin sensitivity. Moreover, dapagliflozin could cause diuresis  and subsequently fall in blood pressure. In addition to general discussion on the  pharmacology of dapagliflozin, we propose in this review the possibilities of  dual antidiabetic effect of dapagliflozin and its possible additional beneficial  actions in hypertensive-obese-T2DM patients through its indirect blood  pressure-lowering action and reduction of body calories and weight. Long-term  clinical studies are however needed to clarify this contention.","2014-04","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","34-39","","","82","","Pharmacol Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Dapagliflozin (DAPA) and canagliflozin (CANA) are  sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors used for T2DM, which is  frequently comorbid with HCC. Three drugs are substrates of UGT1A9 isoenzyme.  This study aimed to evaluate donafenib-dapagliflozin and donafenib-canagliflozin  pharmacokinetic interactions and explore the potential mechanisms. Rats were  divided into seven groups (n = 6) that received donafenib (1), dapagliflozin (2),  canagliflozin (3), dapagliflozin and donafenib (4), canagliflozin and donafenib  (5), donafenib and dapagliflozin (6), donafenib and canagliflozin (7). The  concentrations of drugs were determined by an ultra-performance liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. The messenger RNA  (mRNA) expressions were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Multiple doses of  dapagliflozin caused donafenib maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) to increase  37.01%. Canagliflozin increased donafenib C(max) 1.77-fold and the area under the  plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(0-t) and AUC(inf)) 1.39- and 1.41-fold,  respectively, while reducing the apparent clearance (CL(z)) 28.38%. Multiple  doses of donafenib increased dapagliflozin AUC(0-t) 1.61-fold, AUC(inf)  1.77-fold, whereas its CL(z) reduced 40.50%. Furthermore, donafenib caused  similar changes in canagliflozin pharmacokinetics. The PCR results demonstrated  that dapagliflozin inhibited the mRNA expression of Ugt1a7 in liver and donafenib  decreased the expression of Ugt1a7 mRNA in liver and intestine. Increased  exposure to these drugs may be due to their metabolism inhibition mediated by  Ugt1a7. These pharmacokinetic interactions observed in this study may be of  clinical significance, which may help adjust dose properly and avoid toxicity  effects in patients with HCC and T2DM.","2023-06","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","114663","","","162","","Biomed Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1946 to  July 1, 2017) were conducted using the keywords QTERN, saxagliptin, and  dapagliflozin. Additional data were obtained from the prescribing information,  the product dossier, and Clinicaltrials.gov . STUDY SELECTION AND DATA  EXTRACTION: All English language articles related to pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of the combination therapy in human  subjects were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and  dapagliflozin were not affected significantly when administered as an FDC  product. Saxagliptin may suppress the increased secretion of glucagon associated  with dapagliflozin. The combination dapagliflozin/saxagliptin has been studied as  add-on therapy to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes  mellitus (T2DM). The difference in hemoglobin A(1C) (A1C) between saxagliptin +  dapagliflozin + metformin (triple therapy) and saxagliptin + metformin was -0.59  (95% CI = -0.81 to -0.37, P < 0.0001), and the difference between triple therapy  and dapagliflozin + metformin was -0.27 (95% CI = -0.48 to -0.05, P = 0.0166).  The combination was well tolerated when added to metformin. CONCLUSION: QTERN  (dapagliflozin/saxagliptin) tablets are a reasonable option for patients with  T2DM not controlled on metformin, but cost, insurance coverage, and a lackluster  reduction in A1C will likely limit its use until more data regarding its effects  on complications of diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes become available.","2018-01","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","78-85","","1","52","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28884600","","","","Humans; Drug Combinations; Drug Therapy, Combination; Tablets; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy; type 2 diabetes; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Glucosides/*administration & dosage; saxagliptin; Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism; Metformin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; dapagliflozin; sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; Adamantane/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives; Benzhydryl Compounds/*administration & dosage; Dipeptides/*administration & dosage; dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor; QTERN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to  improving blood glucose control, treatment with dapagliflozin results in  glucose-induced osmotic diuresis, weight loss, and blood pressure lowering.  Previous trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors showed reductions in cardiovascular (CV)  events, including CV death and hospitalization for heart failure, and ischemic  events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). RESEARCH  DESIGN AND METHODS: DECLARE-TIMI 58 (NCT01730534) is a phase 3b randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the CV safety and  efficacy of dapagliflozin that has completed randomization of 17,160 patients  with T2DM and a history of either established ASCVD (n=6,971) or multiple risk  factors for ASCVD (n=10,189). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to  dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo. The primary safety outcome is the time  to the first event of the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or  ischemic stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events; MACEs). The co-primary  efficacy outcomes are the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or  ischemic stroke and the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart  failure. This event-driven trial will continue until at least 1,390 subjects have  a MACE outcome, thereby providing >99% power to test for the primary outcome of  safety of dapagliflozin measured by rejecting the hypothesis that the upper bound  of the CI >1.3 for the primary outcome of MACE, as well as 85% power to detect a  15% relative risk reduction in MACE and an estimated 87% power to detect a 20%  reduction in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure at a  1-sided α level of .0231. CONCLUSION: The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial is testing the  hypotheses that dapagliflozin is safe (does not increase) and may reduce the  occurrence of major CV events. DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the largest study to address  this question with an SGLT-2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and with established  CV disease and without CV disease but with multiple risk factors.","2018-06","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","83-89","","","200","","Am Heart J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

DATA SOURCES: A  MEDLINE (1995-November 2011) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using  the terms dapagliflozin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and SGLT2  inhibitor. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed.  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language studies, including  abstracts, evaluating dapagliflozin use in humans were included in this review.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Dapagliflozin is the first-in-class oral sodium-glucose  cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that represents a new potential therapeutic  option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its mechanism of action is  insulin- and insulin-sensitivity independent. Preliminary data suggest that  dapagliflozin decreases hemoglobin A(1c), fasting plasma glucose, and  postprandial plasma glucose, while also promoting weight loss. In Phase 1, 2, and  3 clinical trials, dapagliflozin has exhibited a safety and tolerability profile  similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin is a novel oral  antihyperglycemic agent that has demonstrated promise as monotherapy and as  synergistic combination therapy with currently available agents in Phase 3  clinical trials. On January 19, 2012, the FDA issued a complete response letter  to AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the new drug application for  dapagliflozin. The FDA is requesting additional clinical data-from ongoing  studies and potentially new clinical trials-to better describe the risk-benefit  profile of the drug. Both manufacturers remain committed to the development of  dapagliflozin, and there are currently 8 Phase 3 trials ongoing. Dapagliflozin  has the potential to be the next new oral agent in the diabetes drug  armamentarium.","2012-04","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","590-598","","4","46","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22433611","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Administration, Oral; Drug Therapy, Combination; Blood Glucose/drug effects; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Benzhydryl Compounds; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Glucosides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dapagliflozin carries a great potential of becoming an alternate-day  therapy because of its favorable pharmacological properties.

We have discussed the properties  by virtue of which it carries a potential to become an alternate-day therapy. We  have also explained the potential benefits and concerns of using this approach.  EXPERT OPINION: Alternate-day add-on therapy with dapagliflozin could be a  promising approach in reducing the cost, improving the treatment satisfaction and  reducing the adverse effects. However, this propsed indication demands an  in-depth investigation among T2DM subjects who are not able to achieve glycemic  control with standard monotherapy or combination therapy. Pilot studies or some  small-scale investigator-initiated trials or academic clinical trials may be  carried out to explore this concept. At the same time, large industry sponsored  multicenter clinical trials including pharmacoeconomic analyses may be planned to  have a more detailed investigation.","2022-02","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","197-203","","2","15","","Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35274589","","","","Humans; Blood Glucose; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Drug Therapy, Combination; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy; Adverse effects; pharmacokinetic; Benzhydryl Compounds/adverse effects; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects; SGLT2i; Glucosides/adverse effects; CHF; compliance; half-life","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Glycaemic control during dapagliflozin  treatment was mechanistically characterized by integrating components  representing dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics (PK), glucose-insulin homeostasis,  renal glucose reabsorption, and HbA1c formation. The model was developed using PK  variables, glucose, plasma insulin, and urinary glucose excretion (UGE) from a  phase IIa dapagliflozin trial in patients with T2DM (NCT00162305). The model was  used to predict dapagliflozin-induced HbA1c reduction; model predictions were  compared to actual data from phase III trials (NCT00528879, NCT00683878,  NCT00680745 and NCT00673231). RESULTS: The integrated  glucose-insulin-dapagliflozin model successfully described plasma glucose and  insulin levels, as well as UGE in response to oral glucose tolerance tests and  meal intake. HbA1c reduction was also well predicted. The results show that  dapagliflozin-mediated glycaemic control is anticorrelated to steady-state  insulin concentration and insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model  framework is the first to integrate SGLT2 inhibitor mechanism of action with both  short-term glucose-insulin dynamics and long-term glucose control (HbA1c). The  results suggest that dapagliflozin treatment is beneficial in patients with  inadequate glycaemic control from insulin alone and this benefit increases as  insulin control diminishes.","2021-04","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","991-1000","","4","23","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33368935","","","","Humans; Blood Glucose; Insulin; Glucose; Treatment Outcome; Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use; type 2 diabetes; Glucosides; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy; Benzhydryl Compounds; pharmacodynamics; mechanism; dapagliflozin; SGLT2 inhibitor; drug","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dapagliflozin, a  sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, has recently been indicated in chronic  kidney disease. Sparsentan may be considered for concomitant use with  dapagliflozin. The purpose of this open-label, 1-sequence crossover study was to  determine whether drug-drug interactions between sparsentan and dapagliflozin  affect dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics (PK). In addition, exposure to the inactive  metabolite of dapagliflozin, dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide, was used to evaluate  the effect of sparsentan on the primary metabolizing enzyme of dapagliflozin,  uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9. The study included 22 healthy  adults treated with 10 mg of dapagliflozin on day 1, and 800 mg/day of sparsentan  on days 5-14, with a 10-mg dose of dapagliflozin coadministered on day 11. PK  samples were taken for dapagliflozin, dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide, and  sparsentan before and after treatment throughout the study. Steady-state  concentrations of sparsentan following daily dosing did not affect the PK of  single-dose dapagliflozin in healthy adults. Dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide PK  suggests a minimal effect of sparsentan on metabolism of dapagliflozin by uridine  5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9.

The morbidity of T2D keeps  growing, and it is estimated that the population with T2D will rise to 552  million throughout the world by 2030. Effective glycemic control in patients is  crucial for the treatment of T2D. However, with progressive deterioration of  disease, most patients are usually unable to achieve glycemic targets receiving  antidiabetic agent monotherapy. In such cases, combination therapy with different  mechanisms of antidiabetic agents is highly desired. In addition, combination  therapy can provide advantages beyond better glycemic improvement such as reduced  incidence of hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed  all the published data regarding the fixed-dose combination therapy of  dapagliflozin combined with metformin, including complementary mechanism of  action, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety. EXPERT  OPINION: The fixed-dose combination of dapagliflozin and metformin exerts  synergistic effects based on two antidiabetic agents with complementary  mechanisms of action.

EXPERT OPINION: No clinically relevant changes  are expected concerning SGLT2i pharmacokinetics in patients with HF while  pharmacodynamic studies reported improvements in myocardium/vascular parameters,  biomarkers, and functional status. All SGLT2is showed a remarkable reduction in  hospitalization for HF in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk.  Furthermore, both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin improved the prognosis of  patients with HFrEF, independently of the presence of T2D. Similar results were  reported with empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF, to be confirmed with  dapagliflozin in an ongoing trial (DELIVER).

Although there are numerous glucose-lowering agents  in clinical use, only approximately half of T2DM patients achieve glycaemic  control, while undesirable side-effects, such as hypoglycaemia and body weight  gain, often impede treatment in those taking these medications. Thus, there is a  need for novel agents and treatment options. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2  inhibitors (SGLT-2-i) have recently been developed for the treatment of T2DM. The  available data suggest a good tolerability profile for the three available drugs  - canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin - approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for the American market as well as in other countries.  The most frequently reported adverse events with SGLT-2-i are female genital  mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and increased urination. The  pharmacodynamic response to SGLT-2-i declines with increasing severity of renal  impairment, requiring dosage adjustments or restrictions with moderate-to-severe  renal dysfunction. Most patients treated with SGLT-2-i also have a modest  reduction in blood pressure and modest effects on serum lipid profiles, some of  which are beneficial (increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and  decreased triglycerides) and others which are not (increased low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C). A number of large-scale and longer-term  cardiovascular trials are now ongoing. In patients treated with dapagliflozin, a  non-significant excess number of breast and bladder cancers has been reported;  considered as due to a bias, this is nevertheless being followed in the ongoing  trials. No other significant safety issues have been reported so far. Although  there is some benefit for several cardiovascular risk factors such as HbA1c, high  blood pressure, obesity and increases in LDL-C, adequately powered trials are  still required to determine the effects of SGLT-2-i on macrovascular outcomes.","2014-12","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","S28-34","","6 Suppl 1","40","","Diabetes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS: Data  from three clinical studies of single-dose (2.5, 5 and 10 mg), orally  administered dapagliflozin in adult (NCT00162305, NCT00538174) and paediatric  (NCT01525238) patients with T2DM were analysed to examine the relationship  between dapagliflozin exposure (area under concentration-time curve) and response  [24-h urinary glucose excretion (UGE)] using a sigmoidal maximum effect model.  Baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR), baseline 24-h UGE, sex and race were evaluated as covariates. RESULTS:  Data from 63 predominantly white or Asian (92.4%) adult and 20 paediatric (45.8%  white; 45.8% black) patients were included. The model appeared robust, with  predictions fitting well with observed data. Baseline eGFR, FPG and sex were  significant covariates in both populations; race was a significant covariate in  the paediatric population only. Model-predicted UGE response was higher in  paediatric (47.4, 67.5 and 85.9 g/24 h for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg) than in adult (31.2,  43.5 and 54.3 g/24 h for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg) patients, which may be associated with  the higher eGFR values in paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: After a single oral  dose of dapagliflozin, adult and paediatric patients with T2DM had similar  exposure-response relationships after accounting for significant covariates.  These results support the planned dosage strategy for a phase III dapagliflozin  safety and efficacy study in paediatric patients with T2DM, for whom treatment  options are currently limited.","2016-07","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","685-692","","7","18","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27299483","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Administration, Oral; Area Under Curve; Treatment Outcome; Child; Blood Glucose/metabolism; type 2 diabetes mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy; paediatric; Hypoglycemic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; dapagliflozin; covariates; Benzhydryl Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; exposure–response; Glucosides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SGLT1  enables the small intestine to absorb glucose and contributes to the reabsorption  of glucose filtered by the kidney. SGLT2 is responsible for reabsorption of most  of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors with varying specificities for  these transporters (eg, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) can slow  the rate of intestinal glucose absorption and increase the renal elimination of  glucose into the urine. Results of randomised clinical trials have shown the  blood glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT inhibitors in type 2 diabetes when  administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies  including insulin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss  and could help to reduce blood pressure. Effective SGLT2 inhibition needs  adequate glomerular filtration and might increase risk of urinary tract and  genital infection, and excessive inhibition of SGLT1 can cause gastro-intestinal  symptoms. However, the insulin-independent mechanism of action of SGLT inhibitors  seems to offer durable glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of clinically  significant hypoglycaemia at any stage in the natural history of type 2 diabetes.  SGLT inhibition might also be considered in conjunction with insulin therapy in  type 1 diabetes.","2013-10","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","140-151","","2","1","","Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

DATA SOURCES: A search of the National  Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and  PubMed database was performed from inception through June 1, 2023. STUDY  SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION QUANTIFICATION: The following study designs were  included: meta-analyses, systematic review, clinical trial, or observational  study design. Abstracts and drug monographs were also reviewed. Narrative or  scoping reviews were excluded. Only articles in the English language and those  evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, or efficacy of  bexaglifozin in humans were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bexagliflozin reduces  hemoglobin A1c ~0.5% with similar reductions in systolic blood pressure and body  weight to other SGLT2 inhibitors. No cardiovascular outcomes trial is published,  nor ongoing at this time. Adverse effects are similar to other SGLT2 inhibitors  (genital mycotic and urinary tract infections, increased urination) including a  warning for lower extremity amputation similar to canagliflozin. RELEVANCE TO  PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE IN COMPARISON TO EXISTING DRUGS: Although no  cost-effectiveness data are available, statements from the manufacturer suggest a  competitive price point. Given limited trial data, lower cost, if chosen, may  create a temporary niche for bexagliflozin pending generic availability of other  SGLT2 inhibitors. However, given lack of cardiovascular and renal outcome data,  empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or canagliflozin may be preferred.

While blood pressure (BP) control has  improved over the past two decades, the control rate is still well below 50% in  the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A new  class of oral glucose-lowering agents has recently been approved; the  sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which act by eliminating  large amounts of glucose in the urine. Two agents, dapagliflozin and  canagliflozin, are currently approved in the United States and Europe, and  empagliflozin and ipragliflozin have reported Phase 3 trials. In addition to  glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with weight loss and act as  osmotic diuretics, resulting in a lowering of BP. While not approved for  BP-lowering, they may potentially aid BP goal achievement in people within 7-10  mm Hg of goal. It should be noted that the currently approved agents have side  effects that include an increased incidence of genital infections, predominantly  in women. The approved SGLT2 inhibitors have limited use based on kidney function  and should be used only in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin and ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for  canagliflozin. Cardiovascular outcome trials are ongoing with these agents and  will be completed within the next 4-5 years.","2014-05","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","330-339","","5","8","","J Am Soc Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 American Society of Hypertension.

Around 1.6 million deaths are attributed to this  disease each year. Persistent hyperglycemic conditions in diabetic patients  affect various organs of the body leading to diabetic complications and worsen  the disease condition. Current treatment strategies for diabetes include  biguanides, sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones,  insulin and its analogs, DPP-4(dipeptidyl peptidase-4) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like  peptide) analogs. However, many side effects contributing to the devastation of  the disease are associated with them. Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)  inhibition has been reported to be new insulin-independent approach to diabetes  therapy. It blocks glucose uptake in the kidneys by inhibiting SGLT2  transporters, thereby promoting glycosuria. Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and  canagliflozin are the most widely used SGLT2 inhibitors. They are effective in  controlling blood glucose and HbA1c levels with few side effects including  hypoglycemia or weight gain which makes them preferable to other anti-diabetic  drugs. However, treatment is found to be associated with inter-individual drug  response to SGLT2 inhibitors and adverse drug reactions which are also affected  by genetic variations. There have been very few pharmacogenetics trials of these  drugs. This review discusses the various SGLT2 inhibitors, their  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and genetic variation influencing the  inter-individual drug response.","2021-08-05","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","174169","","","904","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Dapagliflozin (DAP), a sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, is an  oral medication that improves blood glucose control in diabetic patients.  However, the effects and mechanisms of DAP on DN remain unclear. Materials and  Methods: The effect of DAP was based on a retrospective cohort study of patients  who underwent 2-year surveillance, and the concentration of urine  albumin-to-creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine  were collected after treatment with DAP. To investigate the underlying mechanisms  through which DAP reduces urinary albumin excretion, we used RNA-sequencing  (RNA-seq) to analyze gene expression in human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells treated with  DAP. Results: The retrospective cohort analysis indicated that DAP could reduce  the excretion rate of urinary albumin in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal  impairment. The results of the RNA-seq experiments showed 349 differentially  expressed genes between DAP-treated HK-2 cells and control cells. Gene ontology  annotation enrichment analysis showed that DAP mainly affected the expression of  integral component of membrane- and cell junction-related genes, while the Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that DAP  primarily downregulated the expression of gene clusters associated with cyclic  adenosine monophosphate, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and cyclic guanosine  monophosphate-protein kinase G signaling pathways, which play critical roles in  the progression of DN. Conclusion: Our results shed light on the mechanism by  which DAP controls DN progression and provide a theoretical basis for the  clinical treatment of DN.","2021-10","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","627-637","","10","25","","Genet Test Mol Biomarkers","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34672772","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Follow-Up Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; Cell Line; Retrospective Studies; type 2 diabetes; MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects; RNA-Seq; Down-Regulation/drug effects; Cyclic AMP/metabolism; Renal Elimination/drug effects; diabetic nephropathy; RNA-sequencing; Epithelial Cells; Serum Albumin, Human/metabolism; dapagliflozin; Albuminuria/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/urine; Benzhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapy/urine; Diabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy/etiology/urine; Glucosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New agents that lower blood glucose levels  are therefore needed to help slow disease progression and reduce disease  complications. The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) reabsorbs glucose in  the kidney. Inhibition of SGLT2 by new agents, such as dapagliflozin, has the  potential to reduce hyperglycemia by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the  kidney. Preclinical trials demonstrated that dapagliflozin is a potent and  selective inhibitor of SGLT2. It has shown linear pharmacokinetics over the dose  range of 2.5 - 500 mg/day, is not significantly influenced when taken with food  and is primarily eliminated via urinary excretion. Clinical trials have shown  that dapagliflozin treatment induces glucosuria and improves glycemic parameters  in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Owing to its mechanism of action,  dapagliflozin could potentially affect the renal tubular transportation of bone  minerals. Therefore, markers of bone formation and resorption and bone mineral  density (BMD) were evaluated in patients with T2DM after 50 weeks of  dapagliflozin treatment. METHODS: This international, multi-centre, randomized,  parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov  NCT00855166) enrolled patients with T2DM (women 55-75 years and men 30-75 years;  HbA1c 6.5-8.5%; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) ; body weight ≤ 120 kg) whose T2DM was  inadequately controlled on metformin.

As β-cell function deteriorates, combination therapy is  usually needed to effectively control glycemia. Moreover, some antihyperglycemic  agents are associated with adverse effects, such as weight gain and hypoglycemia.  A novel approach for treating T2DM is to inhibit renal glucose reabsorption  through inhibition of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), which is  responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal  tubule. By reducing the renal capacity to reabsorb filtered glucose, SGLT2  inhibitors increase excretion of excess glucose in urine, thereby decreasing  plasma glucose concentration. Thus, although glucosuria is often viewed as an  indicator of systemic hyperglycemia, this perception needs to be modified in  patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors where glucosuria is an indicator of the  desired treatment effect. Currently, 2 SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin and  dapagliflozin, are approved in the United States for the treatment of patients  with T2DM; other SGLT2 inhibitors are in various stages of clinical development.  Clinical studies in patients with T2DM on a variety of background diabetes  treatments have demonstrated the efficacy of canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in  improving glycemic control and reducing body weight and blood pressure.  Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are generally well tolerated, with a low risk of  hypoglycemia when not used in combination with insulin and/or sulfonylurea.  Higher incidences of genital mycotic infections and adverse events related to  osmotic diuresis and volume depletion were observed with both agents; they were  generally mild or moderate and infrequently led to study discontinuation. Based  on current evidence, SGLT2 inhibitors provide an important new treatment option  for patients with T2DM.","2014-10","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","33-48","","6","126","","Postgrad Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25414933","","","","Humans; Homeostasis; Blood Glucose/*drug effects/metabolism; Kidney/physiology; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Renal Reabsorption/*drug effects; Canagliflozin; Glycosuria/chemically induced; Benzhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Glucosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*drug therapy/urine; Thiophenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with placebo, no meaningful changes  from baseline in markers of bone turnover or BMD were identified over 102 weeks.  One fracture occurred in each treatment group. The frequency of urinary tract  infection (UTI) and genital infection was similar in both treatment groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Over 102 weeks, dapagliflozin improved glycaemic control, and  reduced weight and fat mass, without affecting markers of bone turnover or BMD in  patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin.","2014-02","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","159-169","","2","16","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23906445","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Double-Blind Method; Treatment Outcome; Body Mass Index; Blood Glucose/drug effects/*metabolism; Absorptiometry, Photon; type 2 diabetes; metformin; fat; adipose tissue; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/complications/*drug therapy; *Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Bone Density/drug effects; Weight Loss/*drug effects; SGLT2 inhibitor; Glycated Hemoglobin/drug effects/*metabolism; Benzhydryl Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Glucosides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; bone mineral density; Metformin/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; randomized trial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Type 2  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) contributes significantly to end-organ damage and  HF-related complications and is associated with worse clinical status and  increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HF with reduced  (HFrEF) or with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), compared to HF patients  without T2DM. Recently, a novel class of antidiabetic drugs has been introduced:  sodium glucose co-trasport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Initially designed for patients  with T2DM to reduce kidney blood glucose resorption, SGLT2i rapidly gained  attention among HF specialists since they were able to show a beneficial  prognostic impact in patients affected by HF and T2DM, even independently from  the glycemic control as suggested by the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials.  Areas covered: The present review focuses on the mechanisms and the current  clinical evidence supporting the use of SGLT2i in HF patients with T2DM.  Moreover, the SGLT2i pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties will be  presented in order to better understand the rationale and the design of the  ongoing clinical trials investigating directly the effect of this new class of  drugs in patients with HF, even independently from T2DM. Expert opinion: SGLT2i  are emerging as an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of T2DM and  current evidence has unexpectedly demonstrated a robust cardiovascular protection  in HF patients with T2DM. Therefore, ongoing clinical trials are investigating  directly the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF, even  independently from T2DM. However, it is methodologically disappointing that the  mechanisms underlying the encouraging results in cardiovascular protection of  this drug class are still not fully understood. A better understanding of the  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of SGLT2i is necessary in order to  better determine the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF.","2018-12","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","1273-1285","","12","14","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30472914","","","","Humans; Animals; Research Design; Drug Design; diabetes; Blood Glucose/drug effects; Clinical Trials as Topic/methods; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology; dapagliflozin; Empagliflozin; diabetes treatment; heart failure treatment; Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; renal glucose transporters; sodium glucose co-transport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To quantitatively evaluate the contribution of  proposed SGLT2i mechanisms of action on changes in renal hemodynamics and volume  status, we coupled a mathematical model of renal function and volume homeostasis  with clinical data in healthy subjects administered 10 mg of dapagliflozin once  daily. The minimum set of mechanisms necessary to reproduce observed clinical  responses (urinary sodium and water excretion, serum creatinine and sodium) was  determined, and important unobserved physiological variables (glomerular  pressure, blood and interstitial fluid volume) were then simulated. We further  simulated the response to SGLT2i in diabetic virtual patients with and without  renal impairment. Multiple mechanisms were required to explain the observed  response: 1) direct inhibition of sodium and glucose reabsorption through SGLT2,  2) SGLT2-driven inhibition of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 sodium reabsorption, and 3)  osmotic diuresis coupled with peripheral sodium storage. The model also showed  that the consequences of these mechanisms include lowering of glomerular  pressure, reduction of blood and interstitial fluid volume, and mild blood  pressure reduction, in agreement with clinical observations. The simulations  suggest that these effects are more significant in diabetic patients than healthy  subjects and that while glucose excretion may diminish with renal impairment,  improvements in glomerular pressure and blood volume are not diminished at lower  glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2i may be  sustained in renally impaired patients.","2018-11-01","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","F1295-F1306","","5","315","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30019930  PMCID: PMC6293294","","","","Humans; Treatment Outcome; Computer Simulation; computational modeling; chronic kidney disease; Hemodynamics/drug effects; *Models, Cardiovascular; heart failure; renal function; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Diuresis/drug effects; Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology; Renal Reabsorption/drug effects; Benzhydryl Compounds/*therapeutic use; Glucosides/*therapeutic use; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; SGLT2 inhibition; Cardiovascular System/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 1/metabolism; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this simple renal mechanism that results in  sustained glucose urinary loss leads to more complex indirect metabolic effects.  First, by reduction of chronic hyperglycaemia and attenuation of glucose  toxicity, SGLT-2 inhibitors can improve both insulin secretion by beta cells and  peripheraltissue insulin sensitivity. In the case of canagliflozin, because of  low-potency SGLT1 inhibition, a non-renal (intestinal) effect may also be  considered, which may contribute to better control of postprandial  hyperglycaemia, although this contribution remains to be better analyzed in  humans. Second, chronic glucose loss most probably leads to compensatory  mechanisms. One of them, although not well evidenced in humans, might involve an  increase in energy intake, an effect that may limit weight loss in the long run.  Another could be an increase in endogenous glucose production, most probably  driven by increased glucagon secretion, which may somewhat attenuate the  glucoselowering effect. Nevertheless, despite these compensatory mechanisms and  most probably because of the positive effects of the reduction in glucotoxicity,  SGLT-2 inhibitors exert clinically relevant glucose-lowering activity while  promoting weight loss, a unique dual effect among oral antidiabetic agents.  Furthermore, the combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that either  have anorectic effects (such as incretin-based therapies) or reduce hepatic  glucose output (like metformin) and, thus, may dampen these two compensatory  mechanisms appears appealing for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.","2014-12","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","S4-S11","","6 Suppl 1","40","","Diabetes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

INTRODUCTION: The SGLT2  inhibitors by inhibiting the SGLT2 in the proximal nephron, helps in reducing the  reabsorption of approximately 90% of the filtered glucose and increased urinary  glucose excretion (UGE). METHODS: The literature related to SGLT2 inhibitors has  been thoroughly explored from various available public domains and reviewed  extensively for this article. Detailed and updated information related to SGLT2  inhibitors with a major focus on the recently approved Ertuglifolzin is  structured in this review. RESULT: The present review is an effort to understand  the management of diabetes mellitus over the past few decades with a special  focus on the role of SGLT2 receptor in the causes of therapeutic and preventive  strategies for diabetes mellitus. Pragmatic placement of the currently available  Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, and Empagliflozin as oral antidiabetic agents has  been done. Well accommodated stereochemistry and a high docking score of  Ertugliflozin in ligand-receptor simulation studies attribute to its high  potency. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the unique mechanism of SGLT2  Inhibitors coupled with pleiotropic benefits on weight and blood pressure, which  make it an attractive choice of therapy to diabetic patients, not controlled by  other medications.","2020","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","716-732","","7","16","","Curr Diabetes Rev","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 31951170","","","","Humans; Glucose/metabolism; Diabetes; Diabetes Mellitus/*drug therapy/metabolism; Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2/metabolism; canagliflozin; empagliflozin; Nephrons/*drug effects/metabolism; dapagliflozin; SGLT2; Renal Reabsorption/drug effects/physiology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/metabolism; ertugliflozin; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renal physiology","","1522-1466","10.1152/ajprenal.00628.2016","","The cotransporter SGLT2 is responsible for 90% of renal glucose reabsorption, and we recently showed that MAP17 appears to work as a required β-subunit. We report  in the present study a detailed functional characterization of human SGLT2 in  coexpression with human MAP17 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Addition of external  glucose generates a large inward current in the presence of Na, confirming an  electrogenic transport mechanism. At a membrane potential of -50 mV, SGLT2  affinity constants for glucose and Na are 3.4 ± 0.4 and 18 ± 6 mM, respectively.  The change in the reversal potential of the cotransport current as a function of  external glucose concentration clearly confirms a 1:1 Na-to-glucose transport  stoichiometry. SGLT2 is selective for glucose and α-methylglucose but also  transports, to a lesser extent, galactose and 3-O-methylglucose. SGLT2 can be  inhibited in a competitive manner by phlorizin (K(i) = 31 ± 4 nM) and by  dapagliflozin (K(i) = 0.75 ± 0.3 nM). Similarly to SGLT1, SGLT2 can be activated  by Na, Li, and protons. Pre-steady-state currents for SGLT2 do exist but are  small in amplitude and relatively fast (a time constant of ~2 ms). The leak  current defined as the phlorizin-sensitive current in the absence of substrate  was extremely small in the case of SGLT2. In summary, in comparison with SGLT1,  SGLT2 has a lower affinity for glucose, a transport stoichiometry of 1:1, very  small pre-steady-state and leak currents, a 10-fold higher affinity for  phlorizin, and an affinity for dapagliflozin in the subnanomolar range.","2017-08-01","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","F467-F474","","2","313","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28592437","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Biological Transport; Xenopus laevis; Glucose/*metabolism; Galactose; Sodium/*metabolism; kinetics; Phlorhizin/pharmacology; Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Membrane Potentials; Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism; electrophysiology; Methylglucosides/metabolism; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; dapagliflozin; Benzhydryl Compounds/pharmacology; Glucosides/pharmacology; *Renal Reabsorption/drug effects; 3-O-Methylglucose/metabolism; glucose transport; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2/genetics/*metabolism; transport properties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In tilapia,  a high-affinity, high-capacity kinetic system accounted for the transport  throughout the proximal intestine, midintestine, and hindgut segments. Similar  dapagliflozin and phloridzin dihydrate inhibition across all segments support  this homogenous high-affinity, high-capacity system throughout the tilapia  intestine. Genomic and gene expression analysis supported findings by identifying  10 of the known 12 SLC5A family members, with homogeneous expression throughout  the segments with dominant expression of sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1;  SLC5A1) and sodium-myoinositol cotransporter 2 (SMIT2; SLC5A11). In contrast,  trout's electrogenic sodium-dependent glucose absorption was 20-35 times lower  and segregated into three significantly different kinetic systems found in  different anatomical segments: a high-affinity, low-capacity system in the  pyloric ceca; a super-high-affinity, low-capacity system in the midgut; and a  low-affinity, low-capacity system in the hindgut. Genomic and gene expression  analysis found 5 of the known 12 SLC5A family members with dominant expression of  SGLT1 ( SLC5A1), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2; SLC5A2), and SMIT2 (  SLC5A11) in the pyloric ceca, and only SGLT1 ( SLC5A1) in the midgut, accounting  for differences in kinetics between the two. The hindgut presented a  low-affinity, low-capacity system partially attributed to a decrease in SGLT1 (  SLC5A1). Overall, the omnivorous tilapia had a higher electrogenic glucose  absorption than the carnivorous trout, represented with different kinetic systems  and a greater expression and number of SLC5A orthologs. Fish differ from mammals,  having hindgut electrogenic glucose absorption and segment specific transport  kinetics.","2019-03-01","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","R222-R234","","3","316","","Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30601703  PMCID: PMC6459381","","","","Kinetics; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Species Specificity; Gene Expression; Glucose/*metabolism; gastrointestinal tract; Phlorhizin/pharmacology; Cecum/metabolism; Benzhydryl Compounds/pharmacology; Glucosides/pharmacology; *Intestinal Absorption/genetics; glucose absorption; Oncorhynchus mykiss/*physiology; sodium-dependent glucose transporters; Sodium-Glucose Transport Proteins/metabolism; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism; tilapia; Tilapia/*physiology; trout","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  classified the SGLT2 inhibitors with respect to duration of action as either  long-acting (ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin) or intermediate-acting  (tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin). In the present  study, antidiabetic effects of repeated administration of these SGLT2 inhibitors  in type 2 diabetic mice were investigated. When repeatedly administered for 4  weeks, all SGLT2 inhibitors significantly exhibited antihyperglycemic,  antihyperinsulinemic, and pancreas-protective effects, as well as insulin  resistance-improving effects. When compared at doses producing comparable  reduction in hyperglycemia across all drugs, the antidiabetic effects of  ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin were more potent than those of the other four  drugs, but these differences among the six drugs were not statistically  significant. Further, an oral glucose tolerance test performed after repeated  administration demonstrated significant improvement in glucose tolerance only  with ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin, implying improved insulin resistance and  secretion. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, although all SGLT2  inhibitors exert antidiabetic effects in type 2 diabetic mice, these  pharmacologic effects might be slightly superior with the long-acting drugs,  which are able to provide favorable blood glucose control throughout the day.","2016-07","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","198-208","","3","131","","J Pharmacol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Current treatment plans require  patients to take several drugs concomitantly leading to low therapy adherence.  This study describes the development and characterisation of a stable parenteral  co-formulation of a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) and  a therapeutic lipidated peptide, using hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as an  enabling excipient. Using NMR, calorimetry, computational modelling and  spectroscopic methods, we show that besides increasing the solubility of  dapagliflozin, cyclodextrin prevents self-association of the peptide through  interaction with the lipid chain and amino acids prone to aggregation including  aromatic groups and ionisable residues. While those interactions cause a dramatic  secondary structure change, no impact on potency was seen in vitro. A  subcutaneous administration of the co-formulation in rat showed that both drugs  reach exposure levels previously shown to be efficacious in clinical mono-therapy  studies. Interestingly, a faster absorption rate was observed for the peptide  formulated within the cyclodextrin vehicle with respect to the buffer vehicle,  which could trigger an earlier onset of action. The cyclodextrin based  co-formulation is therefore a promising approach to develop a fixed dose  combination of a therapeutic peptide and a small molecule drug for increased  patient adherence and better blood glucose control.","2020-02-25","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","119019","","","576","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that  the primary route of metabolism for vericiguat is glucuronidation, mainly  catalyzed by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 and to a lesser  extent UGT1A1. Whereas a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of the UGT1A9  inhibitor mefenamic acid showed a 20% exposure increase, the effect of UGT1A1  inhibitors has not been assessed clinically. This modeling study describes a  physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approach to complement the clinical  DDI liability assessment and support prescription labeling. A PBPK model of  vericiguat was developed based on in vitro and clinical data, verified against  data from the mefenamic acid DDI study, and applied to assess the UGT1A1 DDI  liability by running an in silico DDI study with the UGT1A1 inhibitor atazanavir.  A minor effect with an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio  of 1.12 and a peak plasma concentration ratio of 1.04 was predicted, which  indicates that there is no clinically relevant DDI interaction anticipated.  Additionally, the effect of potential genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9  was evaluated, which showed that an average modest increase of up to 1.7-fold in  AUC may be expected in the case of concomitantly reduced UGT1A1 and UGT1A9  activity for subpopulations expressing non-wild-type variants for both isoforms.  This study is a first cornerstone to qualify the PK-Sim platform for use of  UGT-mediated DDI predictions, including PBPK models of perpetrators, such as  mefenamic acid and atazanavir, and sensitive UGT substrates, such as  dapagliflozin and raltegravir.","2024-01","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","79-92","","1","13","","CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Although once thought that the kidney  was the structural cause of diabetes, which in recent years has been ignored as a  regulator of glucose homeostasis, is now recognized as a major player in the  field of metabolic regulation carbohydrate. During fasting, 55% of the glucose  comes from gluconeogenesis. Only 2 organs have this capability: the liver and  kidney. The latter is responsible for 20% of total glucose production and 40% of  that produced by gluconeogenesis. Today we have a better understanding of the  physiology of renal glucose transport via specific transporters, such as type 2  sodium-glucose cotransporter&nbsp; (SGLT2). A natural compound, phlorizin, was  isolated in early 1800 and for decades played an important role in diabetes and  renal physiology research. Finally, at the nexus of these findings mentioned  above, recognized the effect of phlorizin-like compounds in the renal glucose  transporter, which has offered a new mechanism to treat hyperglycemia.

This study evaluated the extent of these opposite  effects in a direct comparative head-to-head study. METHODS: In a single-centre,  randomized study with a cross-over design, 28 metformin-treated patients with  type 2 diabetes (T2D) (mean age, 63 years; baseline HbA1c, 6.8%) were treated  with vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) for 2  weeks, with a 4-week wash-out period between the two separate treatments. After  each treatment period, a meal test was undertaken, with measurements of islet and  incretin hormones and 4-hour area under the curve (AUC) levels were estimated.  RESULTS: Fasting glucagon (35.6 ± 2.5 vs 39.4 ± 3.4 pmoL/L; P = .032) and  postprandial glucagon (4-hour AUC(glucagon) , 32.1 ± 2.3 vs 37.5 ± 2.7 nmoL/L  min; P = .001) were ~15% lower after vildagliptin compared to dapagliflozin  treatment. This was associated with stronger early (15 minute) C-peptide response  and higher 4-hour AUC(C-peptide) (P < .010), higher 4-hour AUC of the intact form  of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1  (GLP-1) (P < .001) and lower 4-hour AUC of total GIP and GLP-1 (P < .001).  CONCLUSION: Treatment with DPP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin results in 15%  lower fasting and postprandial glucagon levels compared to SGLT-2 inhibition with  dapagliflozin. DPP-4 inhibition also induces more rapid insulin secretion and  higher levels of intact incretin hormones, resulting in stronger feedback  inhibition of incretin hormone secretion than SGLT-2 inhibition.","2018-07","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","1652-1658","","7","20","","Diabetes Obes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29498469","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Hypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic use; Metformin/*therapeutic use; Glucagon/*metabolism; type 2 diabetes; Benzhydryl Compounds/therapeutic use; glucagon; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy/metabolism; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/metabolism; Incretins/metabolism; Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism; dapagliflozin; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Glucosides/therapeutic use; DPP-4 inhibition; Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide/metabolism; SGLT-2 inhibition; vildagliptin; Vildagliptin/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, reducing inner exposure to these arsenicals is a  rational objective. Because As(V) mimics phosphate, phosphate binder drugs may  decrease the intestinal As(V) absorption. Indeed, lanthanum and aluminium salts  and sevelamer removed As(V) from solution in vitro, especially at acidic pH. In  mice gavaged with As(V), lanthanum chloride, lanthanum carbonate and aluminium  hydroxide given orally also lowered the urinary excretion and tissue levels of  As(V) and its metabolites, indicating that they decreased the gastrointestinal  As(V) absorption. As some glucose transporters may carry As(III), the effect of  the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin was investigated in As(III)-injected mice.  While producing extreme glucosuria, dapagliflozin barely affected the urinary  excretion and tissue concentrations of As(III) and its metabolites.

Because of its complex condition and poor prognosis, HF has become an important public health  problem in the world. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) is a member of the  glucose transporter family. Recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have been applied to treat  HF. In this study, the main aim was to discover natural SGLT2 inhibitor from  Chinese herbs through docking-based virtual screening. Totally 113 natural  compounds of potential SGLT2 inhibitor were identified, which displayed docking  affinity higher than six approved inhibitors (dapagliflozin (IC50 = 4.9 nM),  canagliflozin (IC50 = 4.4 nM 6.7), ipragliflozin (IC50 = 7.4 nM), empagliflozin  (IC50 = 3.1 nM), tofogliflozin (IC50 = 4 nM) and luseogliflozin (IC50 = 2.3 nM))  through docking-based virtual screening. Then, the top three hits (ZINC70455591,  ZINC85594065 and ZINC14588133) and six known inhibitors were selected for  molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculation using  molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area to demonstrate the stability  and affinity of docked complexes. These results pointed out that the three docked  complexes were stabilized and the chosen compounds were tightly adhering to the  binding site of SGLT2. Besides, pharmacokinetic properties of the selected  compounds showed those natural compounds may be potential drug candidates. This  study may be contributed to further in vitro and in vivo validation and the  development of novel SGLT2 inhibitor for treating HF.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Lowering blood glucose levels by increasing glucosuria].","Medizinische Monatsschrift fur Pharmazeuten","","0342-9601","","","The antidiabetic drug dapagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by a novel mechanism: It increases the excretion of glucose via the kidneys. In clinical  trials, HbA1c decreased by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points if dapagliflozin was  administered either in monotherapy or combined with other antidiabetic drugs.  Common side effects are infections of the urogenital system. It is still unclear  why patients in clinical trials suffered more often from cancer. Especially  bladder cancer could be observed. However, the increase of cancer cases was not  statistically significant. In contrast to the European Medicines Agency, the FDA  has not yet approved dapagliflozin for safety reasons.","2013-04","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","128-132","","4","36","","Med Monatsschr Pharm","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 23654152","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Benzhydryl Compounds; Diabetes Mellitus/drug therapy/metabolism; Glucosides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Glycosuria/*metabolism; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SGLT2  inhibitors are a class of oral antidiabetic drugs that lower elevated plasma  glucose levels by promoting the urinary excretion of excess glucose through the  inhibition of renal glucose reuptake. The inhibition selectivity for SGLT2 over  SGLT1 (SGLT2/1 selectivity) of marketed SGLT2 inhibitors is diverse, while  SGLT2/1 selectivity of canagliflozin is relatively low. Although canagliflozin  suppresses postprandial glucose levels, the degree of contribution for SGLT1  inhibition to this effect remains unproven. To analyze the effect of SGLT2  inhibitors on postprandial glucose level, we constructed a novel quantitative  systems pharmacology (QSP) model, called human systemic glucose dynamics (HSGD)  model, integrating intestinal absorption, metabolism, and renal reabsorption of  glucose. This HSGD model reproduced the postprandial plasma glucose  concentration-time profiles during a meal tolerance test under different clinical  trial conditions. Simulations after canagliflozin administration showed a  dose-dependent delay of time (T(max,glc) ) to reach maximum concentration of  glucose (C(max,glc) ), and the delay of T(max,glc) disappeared when inhibition of  SGLT1 was negated. In addition, contribution ratio of intestinal SGLT1 inhibition  to the decrease in C(max,glc) was estimated to be 23%-28%, when 100 and 300 mg of  canagliflozin are administered. This HSGD model enabled us to provide the partial  contribution of intestinal SGLT1 inhibition to the improvement of postprandial  hyperglycemia as well as to quantitatively describe the plasma glucose dynamics  following SGLT2 inhibitors.","2020-11","2024-04-23 08:34:30","2024-04-23 08:34:30","","352-366","","8-9","41","","Biopharm Drug Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33085977","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Intestinal Absorption; Young Adult; Kidney/metabolism; *Models, Biological; Postprandial Period; Glucose/*metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolism; Blood Glucose/*drug effects; diabetes mellitus; Glucosides/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Benzhydryl Compounds/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Canagliflozin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Pyrazoles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; quantitative systems pharmacology; SGLT2/1 selectivity; Sitagliptin Phosphate/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; sodium-dependent glucose transporter; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; systemic glucose dynamics; Thiazolidines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Thiophenes/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
