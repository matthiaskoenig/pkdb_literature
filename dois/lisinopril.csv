Inhibitors were presented to the livers at  a dose of 100 micrograms. The hepatic clearance of lisinopril was very low (0.072  ml/min) and was hardly excreted into the bile. The clearances of enalapril,  perindopril and ramipril were higher at 0.63, 0.87 and 9.9 ml/min, respectively,  and were excreted into bile. The amounts of ester prodrugs excreted in bile were  4.0, 6.1 and 14%, respectively, whereas the diacid forms were excreted to the  extent of 46, 27 and 71% of the administered dose, respectively, over 4 hr.  Glucuronide metabolites were only detected in bile in significant concentrations  for perindopril and ramipril. Base hydrolysis of the perfusate samples showed  that lisinopril was not significantly metabolized to conjugates and that little  metabolism of enalapril occurred other than rapid conversion to the diacid form.  However, both perindopril and ramipril were extensively metabolized beyond the  diacid form. These differences in hepatic handling can in part be explained by  their octanol-buffer partition coefficients but may also be related to the  introduction of a bicyclic ring in perindopril and ramipril which increases their  ability to be metabolized and excreted into bile. These differences in hepatic  handling of angiotensin-converting enzyme are likely to influence their clinical  usefulness, particularly in renal and hepatic disease.","1990-03","2022-11-17 10:55:28","2022-11-17 16:32:09","","1202-1206","","3","252","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2319468","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Liver/*metabolism; Chromatography; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/analysis/*pharmacokinetics; Bile/analysis/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P.; Follath, F.","[Comparative evaluation of ACE inhibitors: which differences are relevant?].","Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift","","0036-7672","","","ACE inhibitors are well established in the treatment of arterial hypertension, heart failure and diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy with albuminuria. The  important trials for the various indications are briefly discussed. In  Switzerland 11 ACE inhibitors are available for clinical use, differing mainly in  their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The characteristics of  practical relevance regarding oral bioavailability, elimination mechanisms and  half-life, as well as the necessary dosage modifications in patients with renal,  hepatic and cardiac failure, are presented. All ACE inhibitors except captopril  and lisinopril are administered as prodrugs. The bioavailability among ACE  inhibitors varies widely with a range from 11% (trandolapril) to more than 60%  (captopril). The great majority of ACE inhibitors are eliminated predominantly  through the kidneys. However, benazepril, fosinopril, ramipril, spirapril and  trandolapril also have a hepatic (metabolic) route of elimination. Since  half-life varies from 1 h (captopril) to 30 h (spirapril) we drew up, for  simplicity, a table of 3 groups with short, medium and long t1/2. In renal  insufficiency dose adjustment is required only below a creatinine-clearance level  of 30 ml/min. These dosage reductions are not required in liver diseases, but  renally excreted drugs such as lisinopril should be preferred. Treatment with ACE  inhibitors in severe heart failure should be initiated carefully, with low doses  and concomitant diuretic treatment added or maintained. Most common adverse  effects of ACE inhibitors are hypotension, cough, hyperkalaemia and renal  failure. Less frequent adverse effects are angioedema, bone marrow suppression  and also foetal damage. Thus, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy.","1999-07-27","2022-11-17 10:55:28","2022-11-17 16:32:24","","1053-1060","","29-30","129","","Schweiz Med Wochenschr","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 10464907","","","","Humans; Female; Clinical Trials as Topic; Pregnancy; Contraindications; Diabetic Angiopathies/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/drug therapy; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Diabetic Nephropathies/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","The pharmacokinetics of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with renal impairment.","Journal of hypertension. Supplement : official journal of the International Society of Hypertension","","0952-1178","","","The clearance of drugs excreted entirely unchanged by the kidneys is assumed to relate directly to renal function. The clearance of drugs which are entirely  metabolized is usually not altered in patients with renal impairment, although  there are examples of both increased and decreased metabolic clearance rates. The  clearance of metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the kidneys is also  directly related to renal function. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril and quinapril are prodrugs that are  rapidly converted to active metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the  kidneys. Studies have consistently demonstrated reduction in the apparent oral  clearance of the active metabolites, in proportion to the degree of impairment of  renal function. In addition, for quinapril at least, the metabolic clearance of  the parent drug is slightly reduced in renal impairment. The activity of  captopril and lisinopril lies in the parent molecule itself. Lisinopril is  excreted renally unchanged, while captopril is both metabolized and excreted  renally unchanged. The duration of ACE inhibition after administration of any of  the ACE inhibitors is prolonged in proportion to the degree of renal impairment.  From these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, it follows that the  dose rate of the ACE inhibitors should be reduced in direct proportion to the  degree of reduction in renal function. Reducing the dose, rather than prolonging  the dose interval, is more logical for compliance and for maintaining a  consistent degree of ACE inhibition over 24 h.","1989-09","2022-11-17 10:52:32","2022-11-17 16:34:11","","S29-32","","5","7","","J Hypertens Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2681603","","","","Humans; Time Factors; Osmolar Concentration; Creatinine/metabolism; *Tetrahydroisoquinolines; Quinapril; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, after administration of multiple fixed oral  doses the accumulation of the active moieties of fosinopril, enalapril and  lisinopril was compared in patients with renal insufficiency. 29 patients with  creatinine clearances (CLCR) less than 30 ml/min received either fosinopril 10mg  (n = 9), enalapril 2.5mg (n = 10) or lisinopril 5mg (n = 10) once daily for 10  days in a nonblind (open-label) parallel study.

The C-domain cleaves the  vasoactive angiotensin II precursor, angiotensin I, more efficiently than the  N-domain. Thus, C-domain-selective ACE inhibitors have been designed to  investigate the pharmacological effects of blocking the C-terminal catalytic site  of the enzyme and improve the side effect profile of current ACE inhibitors.  Lisinopril-tryptophan (LisW-S), an analogue of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, is  highly selective for the C-domain. In this study, we have analysed the ex vivo  domain selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile of LisW-S. The IC50 value of  LisW-S was 38.5 nM in rat plasma using the fluorogenic substrate  Abz-FRKP(Dnp)P-OH. For the pharmacokinetics analysis of LisW-S, a sensitive and  selective LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to determine the  concentration of LisW-S in rat plasma. LisW-S was administered to Wistar rats at  a dose of 1 mg/kg bodyweight intravenously, 5 mg/kg bodyweight orally. The Cmax  obtained following oral administration of the drug was 0.082 μM and LisW-S had an  apparent terminal elimination half-life of around 3.1 h. The pharmacokinetic data  indicate that the oral bioavailability of LisW-S was approximately 5.4%. These  data provide a basis for better understanding the absorption mechanism of LisW-S  and evaluating its clinical application.","2014-06-02","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:33:24","","113-119","","","56","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Lisinopril was administered orally (10-mg dose once daily for 5 or 8 days).  Measurement of blood pressure (BP) and sampling of blood specimens were made on  the first and last days of treatment. During consecutive dosing of lisinopril,  its antihypertensive effects were sustained for greater than or equal to 12 h  with less diurnal variation of BP. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed for  24 h.

A significant inverse correlation was found  between the creatinine clearance and the AUC for lisinopril. These results  suggest that lisinopril has a long-lasting action and that it is a useful  antihypertensive agent for controlling BP in patients with either NRF or mild  IRF.

Serum  concentration and haemodynamic measurements were made at intervals up to 48 hours  after the first and last doses. The serum profiles of both drugs were comparable  with observations from previous studies, showing higher concentrations in the  elderly and in the renally impaired patients. Similar differences have been  reported for such patient groups when the drugs were administered separately,  indicating an absence of pharmacokinetic interaction. Both drugs accumulated by  about 30% on multiple daily dosing. There were no differences between the patient  groups in the extent of accumulation. The combination of lisinopril and  hydrochlorothiazide produced the expected hypotensive response, minimum BP values  being recorded 4 and 6 hours after treatment. The higher concentrations in the  elderly and renally impaired patients were not associated with a greater  reduction in BP. The pharmacokinetic behaviour of lisinopril and  hydrochlorothiazide given together to elderly and renally impaired hypertensive  patients suggests that a fixed dose combination is appropriate and that no  changes to the dosage regimen additional to those used for the individual agents  are necessary.","1991-12","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:34:04","","77-84","","","5 Suppl 2","","J Hum Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1665183","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Drug Combinations; Aging/*metabolism; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Lisinopril; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Kidney Diseases/complications/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: 22 patients with mild-to-moderate primary  hypertension participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,  2-period, 2-sequence crossover study. Patients on stable lisinopril therapy were  randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous exenatide (10 microg b.i.d.) and  placebo b.i.d. separated by at least 2 days washout period. The primary  pharmacodynamic parameters were baseline-adjusted 24-hour mean systolic and  diastolic blood pressure. Steady state plasma lisinopril concentration-time  profiles were also assessed. RESULTS: Mean blood pressure changes were not  significantly different between exenatide and placebo coadministered with  lisinopril. The least squares mean differences (95% CI) between treatments were  +1.38 mmHg (-1.41, 4.17) for diastolic and +1.38 mmHg (-1.95, 4.71) for systolic  blood pressure. Exenatide delayed the time to attain maximum lisinopril  concentration (tmax,ss) by 2 hours but did not significantly alter maximum  lisinopril concentration (Cmax,ss) or area under the concentration-time profile  (AUCtau,ss) over the 24-hour steady-state dosing interval.

However, it is unknown whether or not  plasma levels or area under the curve (AUC) of ACE-I are associated with  responsiveness to ESA therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the association  between lisinopril AUC, lisinopril plasma levels and ESA requirements that was  assessed using an ESA index [(ESA IU/week/body weight kg)/(haemoglobin g/dL)].  After screening 184 haemodialysis patients, 14 fulfilled the inclusion criteria,  mainly long-term use of oral lisinopril in the upper end of dosage range for this  population with stable haemoglobin levels and intravenous ESA therapy. Lisinopril  plasma levels were measured at eight different time points (predialysis,  immediate post-dialysis and hourly for 6h thereafter; AUC1), and the seven  post-dialysis lisinopril plasma levels were used for calculation of AUC2.  RESULTS: The mean ESA index of all patients was 27·90±25·84 (IU/week/kg)/(g/dL).  Average lisinopril AUC1 was 1212·48±1209·75 [mg*h/L], whereas AUC2 averaged  947·67±977·07 [mg*h/L]. Two patients (14%) had no detectable lisinopril plasma  levels, indicating their noncompliance. There was no association between ESA  index and AUC or plasma levels of lisinopril at any time point for all 14 or for  the 12 compliant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that long-term, high-dose  lisinopril therapy has no effect on ESA responsiveness. Thus, avoidance or a dose  reduction of ACE-I in dialysis patients will not necessarily lead to reduced ESA  requirements and costs.","2012-10","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:33:10","","1087-1093","","10","42","","Eur J Clin Invest","","","","","","","","eng","© 2012 The Authors.

The purpose of  the present study was to investigate the relation between lisinopril plasma  concentrations (C, ng/ml), and lisinopril-induced effects on plasma converting  enzyme activity (PCEA, nmol/ml/min), brachial artery flow (BAF, ml/min), and  brachial vascular resistance (BVR, mm Hg . s/ml). PCEA and BVR were expressed in  percent changes from initial values and BAF was expressed in absolute values.  Effects (E) were related to C by the Hill model: E = Emax . C gamma/CE50 gamma +  C gamma). For PCEA, the model was fitted to the data of both doses  simultaneously. Emax was fixed at -100%, and we obtained (mean +/- SD) CE50 = 1.4  +/- 0.6 ng/ml and gamma = 0.6 +/- 0.1. For BAF and BVR, the model was fitted to  the data of the 20-mg dose for 5 subjects and to those of the 5-mg dose for 1  subject. We obtained Emax = 45 +/- 20 ml/min, CE50 = 24.0 +/- 12.4 ng/ml, and  gamma = 3.2 +/- 1.3 for BAF, and Emax = -45 +/- 15%, CE50 = 22.0 +/- 10.2 ng/ml,  and gamma = 3.1 +/- 1.1 for BVR. Therefore, the concentration-effect relations  for BVR (or BAF) and PCEA display quite different shapes (CE50, gamma), which  emphasizes the necessity of performing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD)  modeling on hemodynamic parameters to determine the optimal dosages of ACEIs.","1996-09","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:33:27","","470-478","","3","28","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8877596","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Vascular Resistance; Brachial Artery/drug effects; Hemodynamics/*drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*blood; Lisinopril/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animals of all 3 strains were provided with tap water or tap water  containing losartan, lisinopril, or a combination of lisinopril and losartan for  2 weeks. On the day of the experiment, Ang-(1-7) was infused for a period of 15  minutes at a rate of 278 nmol . kg-1 . min-1. After this time, samples of  arterial blood were collected rapidly at regular intervals for the assay of  plasma Ang-(1-7) levels by radioimmunoassay. Infusion of Ang-(1-7) had a minimal  effect on vehicle-treated SD rats but elicited a biphasic pressor/depressor  response in vehicle-treated SHR and TG+ rats. In lisinopril-treated rats,  Ang-(1-7) infusion increased blood pressure, whereas losartan treatment abolished  the pressor component of the response without altering the secondary fall in  arterial pressure. Combined treatment with lisinopril and losartan abolished the  cardiovascular response to Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. In vehicle-treated SD, SHR  and TG+ the half-life (t1/2) of Ang-(1-7) averaged 10+/-1, 10+/-1, and 9+/-1  seconds, respectively. Lisinopril alone or in combination with losartan produced  a statistically significant rise in the half-life of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains  of rats. Plasma clearance of Ang-(1-7) was significantly greater in the untreated  SD rats compared with either the SHR or TG+ rat. Lisinopril treatment was  associated with reduced clearance of Ang-(1-7) in all 3 strains. Concurrent  experiments in pulmonary membranes from SD and SHR showed a statistically  significant inhibition of 125I-Ang-(1-7) metabolism in the presence of  lisinopril. These studies showed for the first time that the very short half-life  of Ang-(1-7) in the circulation is primarily accounted for peptide metabolism by  ACE. These findings suggest a novel role of ACE in the regulation of the  production and metabolism of the two primary active hormones of the renin  angiotensin system.","1998-09","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:32:37","","496-502","","3","32","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9740616","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Administration, Oral; Species Specificity; Half-Life; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Combinations; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Radioimmunoassay; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Animals, Genetically Modified; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Rats, Inbred SHR; Losartan/pharmacology; Angiotensin I; Angiotensin II/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology; Lisinopril/metabolism/pharmacology; Peptide Fragments/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Underlying mechanisms  may involve altered angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor pharmacokinetics. We  hypothesized that the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide causes increased steady-state  levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors lisinopril and zofenopril  in rats with myocardial infarction. Rats were subjected to coronary ligation to  induce myocardial infarction. After 1 week, rats were randomized to 50 mg/kg/day  hydrochlorothiazide or control treatment for 3 weeks. The last week, rats  received lisinopril or zofenopril in equipotentent dosages (3.3 and 10 mg/kg/day,  respectively). Rats were sacrificed at Tmax after the last dose of  angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, and tissues were collected for analysis  of drug concentrations. Lisinopril concentrations in plasma were significantly  increased by hydrochlorothiazide, at unchanged tissue concentrations. This  increase could be fully explained by decreased renal function, as evidenced by  increased plasma creatinine levels (lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide 82+/-5  microM versus lisinopril 61+/-5 microM, P < 0.001). In contrast, zofenoprilat  levels in kidney and non-infarcted left ventricle were markedly increased by  hydrochlorothiazide, whereas plasma concentrations were unchanged. Although  hydrochlorothiazide tended to increase plasma creatinine in zofenopril-treated  rats as well, this increase was less pronounced (zofenopril + hydrochlorothiazide  61+/-3 microM versus zofenopril 54+/-2 microM, P = 0.15). Hydrochlorothiazide  increases steady-state angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor drug levels, most  likely by affecting their renal clearance. Notably, the lipophilic  angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor zofenopril accumulated in tissue, whereas  the hydrophilic lisinopril increased in plasma. Whether combining different  angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors with hydrochlorothiazide translates into  distinct clinical profiles requires further study.","2005-12-19","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:32:57","","141-149","","1-3","527","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 16310764","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drug Therapy, Combination; Creatinine/blood; Kidney Function Tests; Ventricular Function; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood; Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Captopril/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Heart Ventricles/drug effects; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacology; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/blood/drug therapy; Kidney/drug effects/physiology; Lisinopril/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Myocardial Infarction/*blood/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antihypertensive treatment of arterial hypertension with angiotensin converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to be effective with a low incidence of  adverse effects compared with other drug classes. Furthermore, treatment with ACE  inhibitors may slow the progression of renal function impairment in certain  groups of patients, such as those with diabetes. Most ACE inhibitors are prodrugs  which are converted by hepatic esterolysis to an active diacid metabolite. Only  captopril and lisinopril have sufficient oral bioavailability and are given as  active drugs. ACE inhibitors can be subdivided into 3 classes with regard to the  active group: the majority of ACE inhibitors are carboxyl-containing drugs, a new  class of ACE inhibitors possess a phosphoryl-group and captopril and related  compounds are sulfhydryl-containing drugs. The predominant elimination pathway of  ACE inhibitors is excretion via the kidneys. Therefore, renal insufficiency is  associated with reduced elimination of most ACE inhibitors and, thus, altered  pharmacokinetic properties. This is most evident in chronic renal failure when  glomerular filtration rates (GFR) are < 30 to 40 ml/min (1.8 to 2.4 L/h). As  renal clearance decreases, the peak plasma concentration and area under the  plasma concentration-time curve of the active drugs or diacids are increased and  time to peak concentrations and half-life are prolonged. However, there are large  between-drug differences in the changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, resulting  in different degrees of drug accumulation after consecutive administration. This  leads, for example, to high accumulation rates for drugs such as lisinopril, or  cilazaprilat. In contrast, fosinopril, which is also excreted to a large extent  by the hepatobiliary pathway, does not seem to accumulate in renal failure. In  general, pharmacokinetics and conversion of prodrugs seem to be slightly affected  in chronic renal failure; however, these changes do not appear to be clinically  relevant. Efficiency of clearance for prodrugs or active drugs and their  respective metabolites by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis varies  considerably. For some ACE inhibitors, such as captopril or enalapril, the high  elimination fraction by haemodialysis necessitates a supplemental dose after  dialysis. Other ACE inhibitors, such as quinapril or cilazapril, are only poorly  eliminated by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Dosage recommendations for  treatment with ACE inhibitors in chronic renal failure depend on the specific  pharmacokinetic properties of the various agents.

Thirty  hypertensive diabetic nephropathy patients with moderate hypertension were  studied. After a 2-week washout period, they were allocated into two groups  matched at baseline for age, sex, weight, blood pressure, and urinary albumin  excretion rate as well as creatinine clearance. There were 8 males and 7 females  in each group. One group received lisinopril (with furosemide if needed to  control BP) and the other group received lacidipine. Staged increases in doses of  antihypertensives were used until BP was controlled or maximum dose of 40 mg/day  lisinopril or 8 mg/day lacidipine was reached. Furosemide was added to lisinopril  if BP was not controlled at 40 mg/day. These medications were given for 12 weeks  at the end of which measurements done at baseline were repeated. Comparison of  baseline and end of study values of these parameters within the groups and  between the two groups were made. Lisinopril group and lacidipine group achieved  similar and highly significant reduction in blood pressure levels P < 0.001.  There was reduction in urinary albumin excretion rate in both groups but this  only reached statistical significance in the lisinopril group [480] [269] mg/day  vs. 315 [202] mg/day P < 0.05] while for the lacidipine group it was not  significant [491] [257] mg/day vs. 335 [182] mg/day P > 0.05]. However,  comparison of albumin excretion rate between both groups at baseline and at end  of the study did not show any significant difference, P > 0.1. With both drugs  there is a tendency for creatinine clearance to increase and plasma creatinine to  drop while plasma potassium tended to rise more with lisinopril than lacidipine  but differences within and between both groups, did not reach statistical  significance P > 0.05. In conclusion, blood pressure reduction was comparable in  both drugs; both drugs reduced albuminuria but lisinopril appeared superior.  Treatment with both drugs tended to increase creatinine clearance but both had no  significant effects on blood sugar.","2002-03","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:32:21","","53-57","","1","31","","Afr J Med Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Nigeria PMID: 12518931","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Disease Progression; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Creatinine/blood; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications; Potassium/blood; Blood Glucose/analysis/drug effects; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Albuminuria/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism; Diabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism; Dihydropyridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology; Lisinopril/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Urea/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Those agents such as temocapril (CS 622) and  fosinopril, excreted both in urine and bile, may not require such adjustment.  Renal clearance of ACE inhibitors may be reduced and some accumulation may occur  in elderly patients with mild renal dysfunction or congestive heart failure. The  bioavailability of ACE inhibitors is reduced by concomitant food or antacids  which may slow gastric emptying and raise gastric pH. Pharmacokinetic  interactions with ACE inhibitors are unlikely in patients receiving thiazide or  loop diuretics. When ACE inhibitors are given hyperkalaemia may occur in patients  with renal insufficiency, those taking potassium supplements or potassium-sparing  diuretics, and in diabetic patients with mild renal impairment. While no  pharmacokinetic interaction precludes use of this combination, the  pharmacokinetics of some ACE inhibitors are subject to greater variability when  patients also receive beta-blockers. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors have  additive anti-hypertensive effects and pharmacokinetic interactions between these  agents are unlikely. One report exists of a significant effect of coadministered  hydralazine on the pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of lisinopril. Data on  interactions between ACE inhibitors and digitalis are contradictory. There is no  evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and digoxin is associated  with an increased risk of digitalis toxicity. ACE inhibitors are mainly excreted  by glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion. Possible interactions  between ACE inhibitors and probenecid have been noted, with renal and total body  clearance of ACE inhibitors being potentially reduced in the presence of  probenecid. Probenecid pretreatment may enhance the pharmacodynamic response of  ACE inhibitors. Few but contradictory data exist on the effects of H2-blockers on  ACE inhibitor pharmacokinetics and little information is available on  interactions between ACE inhibitors and hypoglycaemic drugs. Some case reports  link ACE inhibitors with the induction of lithium toxicity. Coadministration of  lithium should be undertaken with caution, and frequent monitoring of lithium  concentrations is recommended with all ACE inhibitors. Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may attenuate the haemodynamic actions of ACE  inhibitors. NSAIDs reduce renal excretion of ACE inhibitors, with a corresponding  increase in circulating drug concentrations.

This report compares the renal excretory mechanisms for these  structurally related compounds in the rat. After an iv, 1-mg/kg dose, ratios of  renal clearance (CLR) of unbound drug to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for  enalaprilat and lisinopril were 2.72 +/- 0.70 and 1.01 +/- 0.18, respectively,  suggesting that enalaprilat, but not lisinopril, was actively secreted by the  kidneys. Treatment with probenecid and p-aminohippuric acid, potent competitive  inhibitors for the renal anionic transport system, caused a profound decrease in  the renal clearance of enalaprilat to the level of GFR. The CLR/fu.GFR, where fu  is the unbound fraction, became 1.10 +/- 0.09 and 1.25 +/- 0.25, respectively.  These results and the fact that quinine, a potent inhibitor for the cationic  transport system, had little effect on the renal clearance of enalaprilat  indicated that enalaprilat is secreted by the organic anion transport system.

It shows complex pharmacokinetics (PK), and its PK behaviour in  paediatric populations is not well characterized. The aim of this study was to  develop a physiologically based PK (PBPK) model for lisinopril to describe the  drug's PK in children. METHODS: The PBPK model development was performed in a  step-wise manner. An adult model was initially developed to characterize  lisinopril's disposition and absorption and verified using literature data.  Subsequently, the adult PBPK model was extrapolated to the paediatric population  (0.5-18 years old) by accounting for age-dependent physiological and anatomical  changes. Model performance was evaluated by comparing the PK profiles and drug  exposures of observed vs predicted data. RESULTS: The disposition of lisinopril  was well described by a minimal PBPK model-an effective strategy to capture the  biphasic elimination of the drug. The absorption of lisinopril was described by  the intestinal peptide transporter-mediated uptake. The adult model adequately  described the literature data with predictions within a twofold range of clinical  observations. Good model predictivity was also observed in children older than 6  years of age. The model overpredicted the drug exposure in children under 6  years, probably due to not incorporating the actual, unknown ontogeny of the  intestinal peptide transporter. CONCLUSIONS: The PBPK model predicted the PK of  lisinopril in adults and children above 6 years of age well. Model refinement in  children under 6 years warrants future informative ontogeny data of the  intestinal peptide transporter.","2021-03","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:33:46","","1203-1214","","3","87","","Br J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 The British Pharmacological Society.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32693432","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Models, Biological; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; PBPK; Forecasting; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; children; *Lisinopril; angiotensin converting enzyme; lisinopril; paediatric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparison between the  observed and predicted steady-state urinary recoveries of enalaprilat yields an  effective accumulation half-life of approximately 11 h. In normotensive subjects,  enalapril increases renal blood flow whilst leaving glomerular filtration  unchanged irrespective of the state of sodium balance. Similarly under conditions  of salt loading and salt depletion, a biphasic saluretic response is seen which  parallels the excretory maxima for unchanged enalapril (1-2 h) and enalaprilat  (4-8 h) suggesting direct interference by the drug moieties with tubular NaCl  reabsorption. During the period of maximal enalapril action, uricosuria and  phosphaturia are seen, supporting a direct action of enalaprilat on proximal  tubular handling of these anions. Detailed documentation of the chronic metabolic  effects of enalapril remains incomplete.

A review.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199019030-00003","","The orally active angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) such as captopril and enalapril represent a significant therapeutic advance in the  treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Enalapril differs from  captopril in several respects. It is a prodrug converted by hepatic esterolysis  to the active (but more poorly absorbed) diacid, enalaprilat. Enalaprilat is more  potent than captopril, more slowly eliminated and does not possess a sulfhydryl  (SH) group. Enalapril was rapidly followed by a number of newer ACE inhibitors,  the majority of which are similar to enalapril in that they are prodrugs,  converted by hepatic esterolysis to a major active but poorly absorbed diacid  metabolite. In one case (delapril) there are 2 active metabolites; in another  (alacepril) the prodrug is converted in vivo to captopril. Lisinopril is an  exception in that it is an enalaprilat-like diacid but with acceptable oral  bioavailability, so that the prodrug route is not employed. The newer ACE  inhibitors are at widely different stages of development, and it is not yet clear  how many will reach regular clinical use. Of these newer drugs, lisinopril is the  longest established and is the subject of the widest published literature. For a  number there is as yet little published pharmacokinetic information. A variety of  assay methods have been employed to characterise the pharmacokinetics of the ACE  inhibitors, including enzymatic techniques, radioimmunoassay and chromatography.  The peak plasma concentrations of the prodrugs are generally observed at around 1  hour and those of the diacid metabolites at about 2 to 4 hours. However, there is  considerable variation within and between drugs, with benazepril and benazeprilat  reaching peak concentrations early and enalapril and enalaprilat typical of later  times to peak. Absorption of the active diacids is generally poor, and moderate  (typically 30 to 70%) for the prodrugs. The bioavailability of lisinopril is  about 25%. It is difficult to talk meaningfully about half-lives of the active  drugs. The declines in their plasma concentrations are polyphasic and, if  analytical sensitivity allows, active drug may be found at 48 hours or more  following administration. This may reflect binding to ACE in plasma. Half-lives  of accumulation are of the order of 12 hours; protein binding varies from little  (lisinopril) to 90% (benazeprilat). Elimination is mostly renal but there may be  biliary elimination for some, such as benazeprilat and fosinopril. The half-lives  of the prodrugs are short. Impaired renal function decreases the elimination rate  of the diacids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-09","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:32:18","","177-196","","3","19","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2203579","","","","Humans; Animals; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/analysis/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to changes in blood pressure, the aging process also causes numerous  changes in other physiological parameters, resulting in altered pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic responses to the drugs. The dosage regimens for thiazide  diuretics and amiloride must be individually titrated in the elderly patient,  since the elimination of these agents decreases concurrently with decreased renal  function, as indicated by compromised creatinine clearance. The initial doses of  the calcium antagonists should be decreased in elderly patients, since  representative compounds from all 3 chemically heterogeneous classes have been  shown to have decreased clearance in these patients which appears to be primarily  due to the status of hepatic function in the patient. However, with verapamil,  the dosage should be further decreased in association with compromised renal  function. The dosage of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should  be adjusted according to renal function rather than age. Lisinopril, which is  primarily eliminated unchanged, is usually given in lower doses in the elderly,  and doses of both captopril and enalapril may need to be reduced, depending on  renal function. While there is no need to adjust the dosage regimen for the  alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (prazosin, terazosin), caution should be used  with the beta-adrenergic blockers, particularly the hydrophilic agents, since  they are renally eliminated. Labetalol may be a suitable alternative beta-blocker  for the elderly patient, since its pharmacodynamic properties of decreased  systemic vascular resistance without changes in heart rate or stroke volume are  preferential for the elderly patient, and its pharmacokinetics are relatively  unchanged in this population. Drugs that act primarily through the central  nervous system, such as clonidine, methyldopa and guanfacine, require smaller  doses in the presence of renal dysfunction. In contrast, guanabenz is metabolised  primarily by the liver, so it would appear to be useful in elderly patients with  renal dysfunction despite the lack of studies in this population. Guanadrel, an  adrenergic neuron blocking drug, also requires a dosage reduction in patients  with impaired renal function. In addition to the pharmacokinetic changes that  occur in the elderly patient, pharmacodynamic changes may also be anticipated due  to receptor modifications. Older patients have a decrease in beta-receptor  sensitivity, while alpha-receptor sensitivity does not change. When designing the  dosage regimen for a senior patient with hypertension, the combination of all  these variables must be considered.","1991-05","2022-11-17 16:26:36","2022-11-17 16:32:05","","194-211","","3","1","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1686570","","","","Humans; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/*drug therapy/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Diuretics/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with no  lisinopril treatment, reductions of 11% in risk of mortality and 7.7% in a  combined end-point (death plus severe left ventricular dysfunction) were evident  at 6 weeks. Advantages were apparent in all types of patients. Thus, those at  high risk-women, the elderly, patients with diabetes mellitus and those with  anterior infarct and/or Killip class > 1 -also benefited. These gains in combined  end-point events persisted in the longer term, despite treatment withdrawal after  6 weeks in most patients. At 6 months, the incidence rate for the combined  end-point remained lower than with control (a 6.2% reduction). The GISSI-3  results concur with those from recent large investigations (ISIS-4, CCS-1, SMILE)  of other ACE inhibitors as early management in myocardial infarction. However,  the results of the CONSENSUS II trial (using intravenous enalaprilat then oral  enalapril) were unfavourable in some patients. These findings, together with the  development of persistent hypotension and, to a lesser extent, renal dysfunction  among patients in the GISSI-3 trial, have prompted considerable debate over  optimum treatment strategies. Present opinion generally holds that therapy with  lisinopril or other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial may be started within  24 hours in haemodynamically stable patients with no other contraindications;  current labelling in the US and other countries reflects this position. There is  virtually unanimous agreement that such therapy is indicated in high-risk  patients, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. The choice of ACE  inhibitor appears less important than the decision to treat; it seems likely that  these benefits are a class effect. Lisinopril has a tolerability profile  resembling that of other ACE inhibitors, can be given once daily and may be less  costly than other members of its class. However, present cost analyses are flawed  and this latter points remains to be proven in formal cost-effectiveness  analyses. In conclusion, early treatment with lisinopril (within 24 hours of  symptom onset) for 6 weeks improves survival and reduces cardiovascular morbidity  in patients with myocardial infarction, and confers ongoing benefit after drug  withdrawal. While patients with symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction are  prime candidates for treatment, all those who are haemodynamically stable with no  other contraindications are also eligible to receive therapy. Lisinopril and  other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial should therefore be considered an  integral part of the early management of myocardial infarction in suitable  patients.","1996-10","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","564-588","","4","52","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8891468","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Administration, Oral; Treatment Outcome; Tissue Distribution; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Absorption; Drug Tolerance; Kidney Function Tests; Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects; Capillary Permeability/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Cardiotonic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Lisinopril/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Myocardial Infarction/*drug therapy/mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is at least as effective as  usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol and  nifedipine while direct comparisons with other ACE inhibitors have not been  reported. Many patients achieve an adequate blood pressure reduction with  lisinopril alone, and in those who do not, most will with the addition of  hydrochlorothiazide; lisinopril also attenuates hypokalaemia induced by thiazide  diuretics. In patients with congestive heart failure resistant to conventional  therapy, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg once daily improved indices of cardiac function  and appeared to produce greater benefit than captopril in one controlled study.  Lisinopril is well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported.  Thus, lisinopril is a suitable treatment for essential hypertension and shows  promise in the treatment of congestive heart failure. If additional studies  confirm these preliminary findings, then lisinopril will have a similar profile  of indications to other ACE inhibitors, and like some other drugs in this class  it offers the convenience of once daily administration.","1988-06","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","646-669","","6","35","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2844497","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Lisinopril; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES: PubMed was  searched (to December 5, 2011) using the terms exenatide, liraglutide,  albiglutide, and lixisenatide. The search was limited to studies published in  English and conducted in adults. Abstracts from the American Diabetes Association  Scientific Sessions from 2004 through 2011 were also searched. STUDY SELECTION  AND DATA EXTRACTION: All abstracts were screened for eligibility, which consisted  of studies reporting the effects of GLP-1RA administration on the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of concurrent oral medications. Data  extracted from eligible trials included study and population characteristics;  pharmacokinetic parameters including maximum concentration (C(max)), time to  maximum concentration (t(max)), and area under the concentration-time curve  (AUC); and pharmacodynamic properties. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our search identified 254  potentially relevant articles; of those, 11 articles evaluating 15 drug  interactions were reviewed. Only 1 study was conducted in patients with type 2  diabetes. Equivalence in AUC was demonstrated in the majority of drug  interactions studied (11 of 15). The AUCs of acetaminophen and lovastatin were  decreased after exenatide administration and those of lisinopril and digoxin were  decreased after liraglutide administration. In 10 studies, GLP-1RAs decreased the  C(max) and, in 14 studies, prolonged the t(max) of study drug. Pharmacokinetic  properties of drugs and differences in study design can explain differences in  interaction potential. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RAs may produce clinically significant  interactions with drugs that require achievement of target peak concentrations or  a rapid onset of action.

Lisinopril, a new nonsulfhydryl  angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is absorbed in its active form.  Like the other ACE inhibitors, it lowers peripheral vascular resistance, with a  resultant decrease in blood pressure. Approximately 29% of lisinopril is absorbed  after oral administration. No measurable metabolism occurs, and excretion is  primarily renal. Accumulation of lisinopril occurs in patients with renal  dysfunction; however, dosage adjustment is necessary only when the creatinine  clearance is less than 30 mL/min. Lisinopril has been shown to be an effective  antihypertensive agent at doses of 10 to 80 mg given once daily in patients with  essential and secondary hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis. The  effectiveness of lisinopril is comparable to that with diuretics, beta blockers,  and calcium-channel antagonists. In patients who are unresponsive to maximal  doses of lisinopril alone, addition of another antihypertensive agent may be  beneficial. Limited information suggests that lisinopril may be comparable to  captopril for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Adverse effects  associated with lisinopril are relatively minor and are comparable to those  associated with enalapril. Hematological abnormalities have not been reported  with lisinopril. Class-related adverse effects include cough, azotemia,  angioedema, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Lisinopril appears to be comparable to  other ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and may be as effective as  its predecessors for the treatment of congestive heart failure.

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews  the clinical pharmacology of nebivolol and its efficacy and safety profile in  clinical studies of hypertension (the US Food and Drug Administration-approved  indication) and heart failure (off-label use). METHODS: Pertinent articles were  identified through searches of MEDLINE and Current Contents from 1966 through  December 15, 2008, using the terms nebivolol, drug interaction, pharmacokinetics,  and pharmacology. The reference lists of the identified publications were  reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at meetings of the  American Heart Association and the American Society of Hypertension from 2006  through 2008 were also reviewed. All human clinical trials were included,  regardless of design. RESULTS: Twelve published clinical trials were identified  that evaluated the use of nebivolol in the management of hypertension; 1 was  placebo controlled, 1 was placebo and active controlled, and 10 involved direct  comparisons with other antihypertensive agents. Nebivolol was reported to be as  effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) as other beta-blockers (atenolol and  bisoprolol), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril and enalapril),  the angiotensin-receptor blocker telmisartan, and calcium channel blockers  (nifedipine and amlodipine). No published studies were identified that evaluated  the effect of nebivolol on long-term cardiovascular outcomes. In data from a  study in heart failure, nebivolol was associated with a 14% reduction in  all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization at 12 months (P < 0.05).  In comparative clinical studies, nebivolol appeared to be well tolerated relative  to the other antihypertensive agents studied. The most commonly reported adverse  events with nebivolol were fatigue (4%-79%), headache (2%-24%), paresthesia  (7%-13%), bradycardia (6%-11%), rhinitis (1%-7%), and dizziness (2%-5%). Because  of differences in its pharmacologic properties, nebivolol may have potential  advantages in patients who are unable to tolerate traditional beta-blockers (eg,  patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or men who  experience erectile dysfunction while taking antihypertensive therapy).  CONCLUSIONS: Nebivolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker that has been reported  to be efficacious and well tolerated for achieving BP control in patients with  hypertension. Preliminary evidence suggests a potential for reduced mortality in  patients with heart failure.","2009-03","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","447-462","","3","31","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19393838","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Treatment Outcome; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Cost-Benefit Analysis; *Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists; Drug Costs; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Nebivolol; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Benzopyrans/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Ethanolamines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

R.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a comparative review.","DICP : the annals of pharmacotherapy","","1042-9611","10.1177/106002809002400512","","The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and dosages of the three currently available angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are  reviewed. This class of agents effectively inhibits the conversion of angiotensin  I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, a hormone that also promotes, via  aldosterone stimulation, increased sodium and water retention. The ACE  inhibitors, therefore, are capable of lowering blood pressure primarily by  promoting vasodilatation and reducing intravascular fluid volume. Captopril, the  first orally active, commercially available ACE inhibitor, is a  sulfhydryl-containing compound. Captopril was followed by the introduction of  enalapril and lisinopril, two non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitors. The pharmacokinetic  profiles of these three ACE inhibitors differ. Captopril has rapid onset with  relatively short duration of action, whereas enalapril and lisinopril have slower  onset and relatively long duration of action. Captopril is an active ACE  inhibitor in its orally absorbable parent form. In contrast, enalapril must be  deesterified in the liver to the metabolite enalaprilat in order to inhibit the  converting enzyme; this accounts for its delayed onset of action. Lisinopril does  not require metabolic activation to be effective; however, a slow and incomplete  absorption pattern explains the delay in onset of activity. Captopril and its  disulfide metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine with minor elimination  in the feces. Approximately two-thirds of an administered enalapril dose is  excreted in the urine as both the parent drug and the metabolite enalaprilat; the  remainder of these two substances are excreted in the feces. Lisinopril does not  undergo measurable metabolism and approximately one-third is excreted unchanged  in the urine with the remaining parent drug being excreted in the feces. The ACE  inhibitors lower systemic vascular resistance with a resultant decrease in blood  pressure. Their efficacy is comparable to diuretics and beta-blockers in treating  patients with mild, moderate, or severe essential and renovascular hypertension.  In those patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) the ACE inhibitors  produce a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary  capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure. These drugs may produce  improvement in cardiac output and stroke volume and, with chronic administration,  may promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The antihypertensive  effects of the ACE inhibitors are enhanced when these agents are combined with a  diuretic. Captopril and enalapril have been shown to be of particular benefits as  adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure, both in terms of  subjective improvement of patient symptoms, and in improving overall hemodynamic  status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-05","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","506-525","","5","24","","DICP","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2188439","","","","Humans; Animals; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The different actions on tubular transport mechanisms exerted by  lisinopril and nifedipine may contribute to the observed effect on albumin  excretion.","1991-02","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","163-170","","2","229","","J Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1847721","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Kidney/blood supply; Biological Transport/drug effects/physiology; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Nifedipine/*therapeutic use; Lisinopril; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Albuminuria/*drug therapy/metabolism; Diabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy/metabolism; Kidney Tubules/*drug effects/physiology; Sodium/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized,  open-label, crossover, comparative study of telmisartan 80 mg versus lisinopril  20 mg was conducted in 32 untreated hypertensive patients using clinic and  24-hour ambulatory BP measurements. Trough: peak ratio (TPR) and smoothness index  (SI) were calculated for each drug. RESULTS: Using both measurement techniques no  difference was detected between the 2 drugs in their effects either on BP (mean  difference in 24-hour systolic BP 1.2 +/- 7.1 mm Hg, 95% confidence intervals  -1.4, 3.8, and diastolic 0.7 +/- 5.1, -1.2, 2.5) or on PP (0.5 +/- 3.5, -0.7,  1.8). There was no difference between the TPR and the SI values of telmisartan  (TPR 0.85/0.61 for systolic/diastolic BP and SI 1.46/1.2) and lisinopril (TPR  0.74/0.64 and SI 1.3/1.17).

DATA SOURCES: A PubMed database search (1966-May  2006) was conducted, using exenatide as the search term. The manufacturer's  prescribing information was also used. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION:  English-language articles were selected and data were extracted with a focus on  clinical outcomes associated with the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Exenatide exerts a glucoregulatory effect by various mechanisms  including secretion of glucose-dependent insulin, suppression of inappropriately  high glucagon levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, delayed gastric emptying,  and reduction of food intake. In placebo-controlled clinical studies, plasma  exenatide concentrations appeared to exhibit dose-proportional kinetics, reaching  peak plasma levels between 2 and 3 hours after a single subcutaneous injection.  Exenatide's elimination half-life ranged from 3.3 to 4.0 hours, and the time to  reach maximum concentration was about 2 hours. Interactions between exenatide and  agents such as digoxin and lisinopril were not considered significant. In Phase  III trials, exenatide demonstrated significant reduction of hemoglobin A1c levels  from baseline and compared with placebo after 30 weeks of treatment in patients  unable to achieve optimal glycemic control with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or  oral combination therapy (0.4-0.9%). Patients' weight decreased with exenatide  (0.9-2.8 kg), but adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events were common. Exenatide  combined with thiazolidonediones, D-phenylalanine derivatives, meglitinides, or  alpha glucosidase inhibitors has not been studied. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials  have demonstrated that exenatide improves glycemic control when added to  sulfonylureas and metformin, and it may be an alternative to insulin glargine in  patients requiring additional therapy. Hypoglycemia has been encountered in  clinical trials of exenatide, especially upon initiation of therapy with  sulfonylureas (not with metformin); close patient monitoring is therefore  recommended. Further studies should assess the impact of exenatide on clinical  outcomes such as micro- and macrovascular disease.","2006-10","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","1777-1784","","10","40","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16985091","","","","Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*drug therapy; Exenatide; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/trends; Peptides/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Venoms/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In hemodialysis patients, their use is based on weak evidence  because of the lack of a sufficient number of randomized clinical trials. The  strongest evidence is based on two trials. The first showed better survival with  carvedilol in hemodialysis patients with four sessions per week and systolic  heart failure. The second found reduced cardiovascular morbidity with atenolol  compared to lisinopril in mostly black hypertensive hemodialysis patients. No  clinical trials exist regarding myocardial infarction. Large retrospective  studies have assessed the benefits of beta-blockers in hemodialysis. A large  cohort of hemodialysis patients with new-onset heart failure showed better  survival when treated with carvedilol, bisoprolol or metoprolol. Another recent  one of 20,064 patients found out that metoprolol compared to carvedilol was  associated with less all-cause mortality. There is still uncertainty also  regarding the impact of dialysability of beta-blockers on patient's survival. On  top of that, many observations suggested that beta-blockers were associated with  a reduced rate of sudden cardiac death in hemodialysis patients but recent data  show a link between bradycardia and sudden cardiac death questioning the benefit  of beta-blockade in this population. Finally, what we know for sure so far is  that beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with intradialytic hypotension  associated with bradycardia.","2019-04","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","71-76","","2","15","","Nephrol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Société francophone de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation.

Using an ambulatory blood  pressure monitoring technique, we compared, in a cross-over design study, the  effects of four weeks' treatment with enalapril, 10 mg once daily, to lisinopril,  10 mg once daily, on the blood pressure of 19 patients with mild to moderate  hypertension. A significant reduction in blood pressure was shown by both drugs.  However, lisinopril produced a greater fall in mean 24 hour systolic pressure  than did enalapril (difference; 5.94 (C.I. -0.77 to -11.1) mmHg, P = 0.027). The  difference of 3.3 mmHg (C.I. +0.54 to -7.10) in diastolic pressure between the  two agents, though in the same direction, was not significant. Plasma renin  activity did not predict the responses to either agent. Studying the prevailing  information for these two drugs one might expect there to be little difference  between them when administered once daily in terms of antihypertensive effect.  The explanation for the superiority of lisinopril may lie in the slightly longer  pharmacokinetic half-life and possibly in differences in tissue distribution or  persistence. The side effects of both drugs were mild and of similar frequency to  those recorded during placebo treatment, illustrating the generally well  tolerated nature of this class of antihypertensive therapy. The use of ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring provides a method that can detect small, but possibly  important differences between drugs.

For this aim 669  hypertensive patients have been randomized in a double blind, parallel study to  the monotherapy or to the association. The follow-up was of 12 weeks, after a  run-in wash-out period of 3-4 weeks. Seated blood pressure and heart rate were  measured in all 4 outpatients visit and blood was withdrawn for serum  electrolytes, glycemia, serum creatinine, uric acid and lipoprotein profile. 338  patients were randomized to the association and 331 to monotherapy with a slight  prevalence of women. Mean age (58 +/- 9 and 56 +/- 10 years), pretreatment seated  blood pressure (165 +/- 14/102 +/- 5 and 166 +/- 15/105 +/- 5 mmHg) and heart  rate (77 +/- 9 heart/min in both group) were similar in the two groups. Seated  blood pressure was significantly reduced in both groups (-22.8/-16.8 mmHg in the  association group and -18.8/-13.4 mmHg in the monotherapy group), however the  blood pressure reduction in patients treated with the association was slightly,  but significantly, greater. Lipid profile, blood glucose, serum potassium and  creatinine and uric acid were slightly worsened in the monotherapy group, while  there were no changes or a mild improvement in patients treated with the  combination of diuretic and the ACE-inhibitor. In conclusion the association  lisinopril 20 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/die causes a blood pressure  reduction slightly, but significantly, greater than with a higher dose of the  diuretic monotherapy, without any negative interference on lipid profile, blood  glucose and serum potassium.","1995-09","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","389-398","","9","43","","Minerva Cardioangiol","","","","","","","","ita","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 8552268","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug Tolerance; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/*drug therapy/metabolism; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Hydrochlorothiazide/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Lisinopril/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lisinopril induced a dose-dependent (significant after 20 mg) and long-lasting (<  or = 8 h) decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP, approximately 11% after 20 mg)  that was related to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR), because  simultaneously heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO) were unchanged.

They are of particular value in  treating hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and in  diabetics where they have been shown to delay the progression of diabetic  nephropathy. Differences in the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and  pharmacodynamics between the various ACE inhibitors generally do not translate  into significant clinical differences in the majority of patients. However,  fosinopril may be the preferred ACE inhibitor in patients with significant renal  dysfunction because of a reduced requirement for dosage reduction. The duration  of action of ACE inhibitors is determined by two properties, the plasma half-life  and the affinity of binding to tissue ACE. All of the ACE inhibitors (with the  possible exception of captopril) can provide satisfactory 24-hour blood pressure  control in the majority of patients with mild to moderate hypertension when given  once daily. Lisinopril provides consistently better 24-hour control of blood  pressure than either captopril or enalapril. Evidence for superior 24-hour blood  pressure control over enalapril has not been as well established for the other  ACE inhibitors. Captopril may be preferred for initiating therapy in patients  with severe heart failure who are at risk of first dose hypertension because of  its rapid onset of action and relatively short duration of action. There is  evidence, however, that perindopril may have a low risk of first dose  hypertension in heart failure because of its gradual onset of action.

Hibiscus sabdariffa is a plant known in many countries  and is consumed as hot and cold drinks In addition to its use in folk medicine;  it has been suggested as treatment for many conditions including hypertension.  OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review were to examine the evidence of  effectiveness and safety of hibiscus in the treatment of hypertension. METHODS:  We searched several medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials, and the specialized register of the Cochrane  Hypertension Group and the general engine Google) to January 2009. We included  randomized controlled trials that had examined Hibiscus's effectiveness and  safety in the treatment of primary hypertension in adults. Two authors  independently selected the trials for the review, extracted the data, and  critically appraised the included studies. RESULTS: Four trials, with a total of  390 patients, met our inclusion criteria. Two studies compared Hibiscus  sabdariffa to black tea; one study compared it to captopril and one to  lisinopril. The studies found that Hibiscus had greater blood pressure reduction  than tea but less than the ACE-inhibitors. However, all studies, except one, were  short term and of poor quality with a Jadad scoring of <3 and did not meet  international standards. CONCLUSION: The four randomized controlled studies  identified in this review do not provide reliable evidence to support  recommending Hibiscus sabdariffa for the treatment of primary hypertension in  adults.","2010-02","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","83-86","","2","17","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

R.","Omapatrilat: a unique new agent for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.","Heart disease (Hagerstown, Md.)","","1521-737X","","","Omapatrilat is the most clinically advanced of a new class of drugs, vasopeptidase inhibitors, which are being studied for the treatment of patients  with cardiovascular disease. Omapatrilat inhibits the enzymatic activities of  angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. The end result is  blockade of angiotensin-II formation and inhibition of the catabolism of  vasodilatory hormones, such as the natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and  adrenomedullin. Some of the ultimate pharmacologic effects include vasodilation,  natriuresis, and diuresis, which may be beneficial in the management of various  cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart failure. The  pharmacokinetics of omapatrilat are compatible with once-daily dosing and a  duration of antihypertensive efficacy of more than 24 hours. Omapatrilat  decreases blood pressure in both high-renin and low-renin states, which suggests  antihypertensive efficacy that is independent of the status of the  renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, the antihypertensive effect of omapatrilat  is indiscriminate of age or race. Omapatrilat has consistently shown efficacy in  decreasing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to a similar or greater  extent than either lisinopril or amlodipine; however, systolic pressure is more  responsive to omapatrilat treatment than diastolic pressure. Although the role of  omapatrilat in heart failure is still evolving, preliminary results are  promising: hemodynamic improvements and clinical benefits of omapatrilat are  similar or greater to those achieved with an angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitor. Future studies (specifically the OVERTURE Study) will be of pivotal  importance in establishing the role of omapatrilat in the treatment of patients  with heart failure. The side-effect and drug-interaction profiles of omapatrilat  are largely incomplete, but suggest excellent tolerability and a side-effect  profile that is similar to placebo. Omapatrilat could be a revolutionary addition  to the management of cardiovascular disease, and its clinical development will be  followed closely by many who are curious if larger clinical trials will echo the  impressive preliminary data that have been seen thus far.","2000-06","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","266-274","","3","2","","Heart Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11728268","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Dogs; Drug Approval; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Cricetinae; Cardiovascular Diseases/*drug therapy; Cardiovascular Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Pyridines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Thiazepines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some  antidiabetic properties of ARB and ACE-I might by exerted by activation of  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). However, it is not  clear whether this action is drug specific. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The binding  affinity of telmisartan, valsartan, lisinopril, rosiglitazone and angiotensin II  to PPARgamma was assessed in a cell-free assay system. PPARgamma signalling was  studied in isolated skeletal muscle cells using Western blot analysis of  phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) and phosphorylated insulin like growth  factor-1 receptor (pILGF-1R). Further, the ability of the drugs under study to  stimulate the release of the adipocytokine visfatin was investigated in isolated  human adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and umbilical vein endothelial cells  (HUVEC). RESULTS: The binding affinity to PPARgamma was highest for telmisartan  with a half-maximal effective concentration of 463 nM, followed by lisinopril  (2.9 microM) and valsartan (6.2 microM). In skeletal muscle cells phosphorylation  of ILGF-1R was 2-fold increased after incubation with telmisartan or valsartan  and 1.7-fold with lisinopril. pAKT expression was enhanced after incubation with  telmisartan, valsartan and with lisinopril. The release of visfatin from  adipocytes was 1.6-fold increased after treatment with lisinopril and about  2.0-fold increased with telmisartan and valsartan. Similar results were obtained  in skeletal muscle cells and HUVEC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm agonism of  telmisartan, valsartan and lisinopril on PPARgamma. Pharmacokinetic differences  may explain different potencies of PPARgamma stimulation by drugs acting on the  renin-angiotensin system in clinical settings.","2008-11","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","820-826","","11","38","","Eur J Clin Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19021699","","","","Humans; Valsartan; Blotting, Western; Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism; Rosiglitazone; Telmisartan; Tetrazoles/metabolism/pharmacology; Valine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology; Thiazolidinediones/metabolism/pharmacology; PPAR gamma/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; *Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Adipocytes/drug effects/*metabolism; Angiotensin II; Benzimidazoles/metabolism; Benzoates/metabolism; Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism; Intra-Abdominal Fat/drug effects/metabolism; Lisinopril/metabolism; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/drug effects/*metabolism; Receptor, IGF Type 1/drug effects/metabolism; Umbilical Veins/drug effects/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supplement","","1368-504X","10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02498.x","","AIMS: This article reviews practical issues that healthcare providers need to consider when implementing therapy with the once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1  (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide. KEY POINTS: Liraglutide is administered  once daily by subcutaneous injection, independent of meals and at any time of  day. To improve gastro-intestinal tolerability, the starting dose is 0.6 mg  liraglutide daily. After at least 1 week, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg.  Some patients may benefit from an additional increment to the maximum recommended  daily dose of 1.8 mg. Daily blood glucose monitoring is not required, although  may be necessary if liraglutide is used with a sulphonylurea (SU). Treatment is  contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to liraglutide or an  excipient. Liraglutide slows gastric emptying, but does not interact with  acetaminophen, oral contraceptives, atorvastatin, griseofulvin, lisinopril or  digoxin in a way that necessitates dose adjustments of these agents. The efficacy  and safety of liraglutide are not influenced by differences in gender, age or  ethnicity and race. Overall, liraglutide is generally well tolerated. Patients  can experience gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, which diminish over  time. As liraglutide increases insulin production in a glucose-dependent manner,  the incidence of hypoglycaemia largely depends on the hypoglycaemic risk profile  of the selected oral antidiabetic with which it is used. The use of an SU may  increase the risk of hypoglycaemia; this risk can be lowered by reducing the SU  dose. CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide is a once-daily treatment option that can be used  in adults with type 2 diabetes regardless of gender, age (although therapeutic  experience in patients over 75 years of age is limited) and ethnicity or race.","2010-10","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","35-43","","167","","","Int J Clin Pract Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20949699","","","","Adult; Humans; Drug Interactions; Treatment Outcome; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Nausea/chemically induced; Injections, Subcutaneous; Liraglutide; Drug Dosage Calculations; Contraindications; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/metabolism; *Sulfonylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Hypoglycemia/chemically induced; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Receptors, Glucagon/agonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation enrolled 50 patients (mean age 57.9  years) with essential hypertension. All the patients received the fixed-dose  antihypertensive combination. Stable Functional Class I or II exertional angina  was in 46% of the patients. The remaining 54% were found to have brachiocephalic  atherosclerosis. All the patients had dyslipidemia and were given rosuvastatin.  RESULTS: The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) initially reached 164.26 mm Hg.  During the whole follow-up, the reduction in mean SBP generally accounted for  22.6% (p = 0.000). At the study inclusion, the mean diastolic blood pressure  (DBP) reached 99.38 mm Hg. The total decline in mean DBP was 19.3% (p = 0.000).  The mean level of total cholesterol (TC) decreased significantly by 32.1% (p =  0.000); that of triglycerides (TG) also fell significantly by 31.8% (p = 0.04);  that of high-density lipoproteins increased insignificantly by 11.1% (p = 0.599);  that of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) dropped significantly by 47.5% (p =  0.000). CONCLUSION: Being safe, the fixed-dose lisinopril and amlodipine  combination is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertensive  disease (HD) concurrent with coronary heart disease (CHD) or atherosclerotic  changes in the carotid artery. The use of rosuvastatin in patients with HD  concurrent with CHD during 2 months causes positive changes in the blood lipid  composition as a significant reduction in the-levels of (TC), LDL, and TG.","2014","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","71-76","","9","86","","Ter Arkh","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 25518509","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Treatment Outcome; Drug Monitoring; Rosuvastatin Calcium; Drug Combinations; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Drug Therapy, Combination; Essential Hypertension; Lipid Metabolism/drug effects; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Dyslipidemias/blood/complications/drug therapy; *Amlodipine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Coronary Disease/blood/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy; *Fluorobenzenes/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Hypertension/blood/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy; *Lisinopril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Hypolipidemic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A reappraisal of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in cardiovascular disorders.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199142030-00007","","Atenolol is a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a duration of activity of at least 24 hours. The scope of therapeutic use of the drug has been  expanded and become better defined since it was first reviewed in the Journal in  1979. Atenolol is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with all  grades of hypertension. Data from comparative studies show that when administered  orally, atenolol reduces blood pressure to a similar extent, and in a similar  proportion of patients, as usual therapeutic doses of other beta-adrenoceptor  antagonists (such as acebutolol, celiprolol, betaxolol, indenolol, metoprolol,  nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, tertatolol), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril and lisinopril), calcium antagonists (e.g.  amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine,  verapamil), doxazosin, ketanserin and alpha-methyldopa. Atenolol effectively  lowers blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension and in women with  hypertension associated with pregnancy, and improves objective and subjective  indices in patients with stable angina pectoris. Oral atenolol is used for  preventing recurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias once control is achieved by  intravenous administration of atenolol. Early intervention with intravenous  atenolol followed by oral maintenance therapy reduces infarct recurrence and  cardiovascular mortality in patients with known or suspected myocardial  infarction. There is also encouraging evidence of reduced mortality from  cardiovascular disease during long term therapy with atenolol in patients with  hypertension. Atenolol is well tolerated in most patients. Increases in plasma  levels of both total triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)  triglycerides have accompanied atenolol therapy although the clinical relevance,  if any, of longer term metabolic effects has yet to be determined. Its low lipid  solubility and limited brain penetration results in a lower incidence of central  nervous system effects than that associated with propranolol. After many years of  clinical usage atenolol is a well established treatment option in several areas  of cardiovascular medicine such as mild to moderate hypertension and stable  angina pectoris. Furthermore, it has also shown potential in the treatment of  some cardiac arrhythmias and has been associated with reduced cardiovascular  mortality in patients with hypertension and in patients with myocardial  infarction.","1991-09","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","468-510","","3","42","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1720383","","","","Humans; Drug Evaluation; Coronary Disease/*drug therapy; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*drug therapy; Atenolol/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radioligand inhibitor binding methods using 125I-351A and either  tissue homogenates or in vitro autoradiography have allowed in vitro and ex vivo  quantitation of tissue ACE inhibition by a variety of ACE inhibitors. The rank  order of potency against plasma as well as lung, kidney, and cardiac homogenates  was quinaprilat = benazeprilat greater than perindoprilat greater than lisinopril  greater than enalaprilat greater than fosinoprilat. The highest concentration of  ACE in the heart was found in the cardiac valves followed by the right and left  atria, then the right and left ventricles. Ex vivo studies showed that after oral  administration of quinapril, ACE was inhibited dose-dependently in the lung,  kidney, aorta and heart for more than 24h. Tissue bioavailability of the  inhibitor is also an important determinant of tissue ACE inhibition. Perindopril  crossed the blood-brain barrier and inhibited brain ACE at high doses, but after  equivalent doses of quinapril no brain ACE inhibition could be demonstrated.

A guide to selection.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199549040-00003","","To find out if there are one or more criteria to guide selection among the ACE inhibitors for the treatment of arterial hypertension, we have reviewed the  principal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of the more frequently used  agents of this class of antihypertensive drugs. Among the pharmacokinetic aspects  that we have considered, terminal half-life, as related to the duration of the  antihypertensive effect, and the route of elimination may have an impact in the  clinical selection among the various ACE inhibitors. On the other hand, all the  other characteristics have no pragmatic clinical relevance or may be corrected by  dosage adjustment. Among the pharmacodynamic aspects, the antihypertensive  efficacy of the different ACE inhibitors seems to be very similar, and some of  the differences found in different studies are probably due to the population  investigated and to the protocol of the study (time of blood pressure  measurements, diet, drug dosage etc.). However, some differences can be found  among the various ACE inhibitors when the antihypertensive efficacy is evaluated  also as trough to peak ratio of blood pressure reduction. Indeed, in respect of  the administration schedule of each ACE inhibitor not all the agents of this  class have a trough to peak ratio above 50 to 60%, as suggested by the Food and  Drug Administration of the US. According to this criterion, especially when blood  pressure is measured with 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure  monitoring, some drugs such as lisinopril, enalapril and trandolapril should be  preferred for their higher trough to peak ratios. Left ventricular hypertrophy is  significantly reduced by antihypertensive agents, the ACE inhibitors being the  most effective. Indeed, the reduction of left ventricle mass for each 1 mm Hg  reduction in mean blood pressure is greater for ACE inhibitors than for other  classes of antihypertensive agents. However, this effect seems more class related  than characteristic of one or more among the various ACE inhibitors. Insulin  resistance is elevated in hypertensive patients and it has been thought  responsible for or associated with other metabolic abnormalities. ACE inhibitors  seem to correct the insulin resistance of hypertensive patients, but this effect  also appears to be class related more than limited to one ACE inhibitor or  another. Our knowledge of this field is still limited and more studies are  necessary, especially to understand the prognostic impact of insulin resistance  and/or insulin resistance improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1995-04","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","516-535","","4","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7789286","","","","Humans; Aged; Insulin Resistance; Ligands; Quality of Life; Proteinuria; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics; Arteriosclerosis/drug therapy; Zinc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Norfloxacin (NFX) is a fluoroquinolone that presents low solubility  and low permeability, and as a consequence, low bioavailability. In this context,  the aim of this study is evaluate for the first time the intestinal permeability  mechanisms of NFX by Ussing chamber model. The low permeation of NFX at low  temperature, where the efflux pumps are not active, reveals that NFX permeation  is transporter-dependent. The permeation study at different level of intestine  demonstrated that NFX passage is in the decrescent order:  ileum > jejunum > duodenum > colon, probably attributed to transporters that are  expressed differently along the intestinal tract. NFX intestinal flow was  evaluated in the presence of many inhibitors and substrates to identify the  uptake and efflux transporters implicate in NFX permeability mechanism. It could  be observed that BCRP and MRPs are involved in the NFX efflux and PEPT1, PMAT and  OCT in the NFX uptake transport. Furthermore, this work revealed that NFX has  itself an affinity for OCTN and OATP, demonstrating that NFX could inhibit these  transporters and influence the absorption of other drugs. The updated description  of NFX intestinal permeability factors could contribute to the development of  rational pharmaceutical formulations that could circumvent the efflux problems  and consequently improve NFX biopharmaceutical properties and avoid drug-drug  interactions.","2018-08-30","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","236-242","","","121","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018.

Substitution of nifedipine GITS for conventional  formulations of nifedipine, diltiazem or verapamil, maintained adequate control  of anginal symptoms in patients with stable angina pectoris. Nifedipine GITS  appears to maintain quality of life and is apparently better tolerated than those  formulations of nifedipine which require 2 or 3 times daily administration in  both elderly and younger patients. In addition, it has minimal effect on lipid  and glucose metabolism and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy, and is thus  suitable for treatment of the majority of patients with mild to moderate  hypertension or angina pectoris.","1995-09","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","495-512","","3","50","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8521771","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Pharmacokinetics; Angina Pectoris/*drug therapy; Drug Delivery Systems; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Nifedipine/*adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trandolaprilat  inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and displays similar  pharmacodynamic properties to other ACE inhibitors, improving haemodynamic and  cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension. Trandolapril 2 to 4mg  once daily effectively controls blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients  with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative  trials, trandolapril had similar antihypertensive efficacy to that of atenolol,  enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and sustained release nifedipine, but  was more effective than captopril. Combined therapy with trandolapril and  hydrochlorothiazide or sustained release nifedipine had a significantly greater  antihypertensive effect than either drug treatment alone. Further comparative  trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. The tolerability  profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, most adverse  events being generally mild and transient in nature, and trandolapril lacks  adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, trandolapril, with  its favourable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to  that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate  hypertension, is likely to provide a well tolerated option for the treatment of  this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine  its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients following myocardial  infarction.","1994-07","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","71-90","","1","48","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7525196","","","","Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Drug Tolerance; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Indoles/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part of the  explanation for this lies in differences in pharmacological properties. Depending  on the kinetics of elimination, the trough:peak ratio of short- and long-acting  ACE inhibitors has to be evaluated according to a dose regimen of twice or once a  day, respectively, and must take account of the dose used, since long-acting ACE  inhibitors appear to have a dose-dependent trough:peak effect. Further  explanations for the contradictory trough:peak ratios reported for ACE inhibitors  include measurement methods (clinic blood pressure versus ambulatory monitoring)  and study design. TROUGH:PEAK RATIO: Data from randomly allocated,  placebo-controlled studies indicate that both the short-acting ACE inhibitors  captopril and quinapril given twice a day and the long-acting ACE inhibitors  enalapril, lisinopril, benazepril and cilazapril given once a day have an  acceptable trough:peak ratio (> 50%).

Recent reference-based pricing measures have targeted several drug  classes, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The objective  of this study was to assess whether patients treated for hypertension with  various ACE inhibitors differed in their utilization of health care services and  hence, whether the various ACE inhibitors should be considered therapeutically  equivalent. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was formed from 4709 Saskatchewan  residents aged 40-79 years who initiated treatment for hypertension with 1 of the  3 most frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril or lisinopril)  between Jan. 1, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1993. Information obtained from universal  insurance databases included prescription drug use, the number of visits to a  general practitioner (GP) or specialist and the number of hospital admissions  during the year before treatment was initiated and during a follow-up period of  up to 4 years. Rates were statistically adjusted for potential confounding  variables and compared across treatment groups. RESULTS: Of the 4709 patients,  529 were prescribed captopril initially, 2939 enalapril and 1241 lisinopril.  After treatment was initiated patients prescribed captopril were dispensed more  medications on average, with an overall rate of 18.6 prescriptions per patient  per year (v. 16.4 and 14.7 for enalapril and lisinopril users respectively); they  were admitted to hospital more often, and they made more visits to GPs and  specialists. The adjusted rate ratio of the number of visits to a GP for patients  receiving enalapril, relative to captopril, was 0.84 (95% confidence interval  [CI] 0.80-0.88), and for those receiving lisinopril it was 0.79 (95% CI  0.74-0.83). The adjusted rate ratios for the number of visits to a specialist  were similar but lower, and for the number of hospital admissions they were 0.82  for patients prescribed enalapril initially (95% CI 0.73-0.93) and 0.65 (95% CI  0.56-0.75) for those prescribed lisinopril. INTERPRETATION: Patients with  hypertension who are initially prescribed captopril used health care services  more than those initially prescribed enalapril or lisinopril.

Intriguingly, case reports and clinical  trials have indicated that ACEIs, including captopril and lisinopril, may have a  rapid mood-elevating effect in certain patients, but few experimental studies  have investigated their value as fast-onset antidepressants. METHODS: The present  study consisted of a series of experiments using biochemical assays,  immunohistochemistry, and behavioral techniques to examine the effect and  mechanism of captopril on depressive-like behavior in 2 animal models, the  chronic unpredictable stress model and the chronic social defeat stress model.  RESULTS: Captopril (19.5 or 39 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) exerted rapid  antidepressant activity in mice treated under the chronic unpredictable stress  model and mice treated under the chronic social defeat stress model.  Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that captopril crossed the blood-brain barrier  and that lisinopril, another ACEI with better blood-brain barrier permeability,  exerted a faster and longer-lasting effect at a same molar equivalent dose. This  antidepressant effect seemed to be independent of the renin-angiotensin system,  but dependent on the bradykinin (BK) system, since the decreased BK detected in  the stressed mice could be reversed by captopril. The hypofunction of the  downstream effector of BK, Cdc42 (cell division control protein 42) homolog,  contributed to the stress-induced loss of dendritic spines, which was rapidly  reversed by captopril via activating the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin  complex 1) pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the BK-dependent  activation of mTORC1 may represent a promising mechanism underlying  antidepressant pharmacology. Considering their affordability and availability,  ACEIs may emerge as a novel fast-onset antidepressant, especially for patients  with comorbid depression and hypertension.","2020-09-01","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","415-425","","5","88","","Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of indocyanine  green (ICG) pulmonary disposition was applied to in vivo imaging data and PS was  estimated. In vivo results were validated by five accepted assays: ex vivo  perfused lung imaging, endothelial filtration coefficient (Kf) measurement,  pulmonary vascular resistance measurement, Evan's blue dye uptake, and  histopathology. A PBPK model-derived measure of lung vascular  permeability-surface area product increased from 2.60 ± 0.40 [CL: 2.42-2.78]  mL/min in the non-irradiated group to 6.94 ± 8.25 [CL: 3.56-10.31] mL/min in  13 Gy group after 42 days. Lisinopril treatment lowered PS in the 13 Gy group to  4.76 ± 6.17 [CL: 2.12-7.40] mL/min. A much higher up to 5× change in PS values  was observed in rats exhibiting severe radiation injury.

How does it differ from other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors?","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199300462-00027","","Among the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that differentiate trandolapril from other angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors, the most clinically relevant ones are those that contribute to the  long duration of action of the drug. The long elimination half-life of  trandolapril and its strong lipophilicity, high ACE inhibitor potency and high  affinity for the ACE cause the drug to have a long biological half-life. The long  duration of action of trandolapril may be demonstrated experimentally; near total  ACE inhibition is observed 24 hours after single dose administration and there is  significant ACE inhibition 72 hours following drug withdrawal after long term  therapy. We have analysed the duration of blood pressure lowering during long  term therapy with commercially available ACE inhibitors in published studies  using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. On the basis of results from 19  studies undertaken in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, it was  possible to reconstruct the curve of the magnitude of blood pressure changes  against time. Mean trough: peak ratio calculations showed that once-daily  administration produced ratios higher than 50% with enalapril (40 to 80%),  lisinopril (40 to 70%) and trandolapril (50 to 100%). Other ACE inhibitors had  trough: peak ratios lower than 50%. Despite many methodological limitations, this  literature analysis demonstrates that trandolapril has a blood pressure-lowering  effect for the full 24-hour period. Studies in which a dose is occasionally  omitted show that the blood pressure-lowering effect of trandolapril may last  beyond 24 hours.","1993","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","172-181; discussion 182","","","46 Suppl 2","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7512472","","","","Humans; Animals; Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Hypertension/drug therapy/physiopathology; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the tissue ACE were assessed by quantitative in vitro autoradiography after acute and  chronic administrations of the drugs. 2. Following acute administration of  lisinopril, perindopril or benazepril, ACE was markedly inhibited in the lung,  kidney and blood vessels but not in the testis. In the brain, ACE was inhibited  mainly in structures with a deficient blood brain barrier. 3. High doses of  perindopril progressively inhibited ACE in other brain structures. Tissue ACE  inhibition persisted after serum levels of the enzyme had returned to control  levels. In the case of perindopril, the time course of tissue ACE inhibition  correlated with the inhibition of the pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin  I. 4. After chronic administration of lisinopril or perindopril for 14 days, a  similar pattern of ACE inhibition was observed in the kidney, lung and blood  vessels. In the lung, however, lisinopril was found to increase total ACE by 30%,  while plasma ACE was increased two-threefold by both lisinopril and perindopril.  Testicular ACE remained unaltered by chronic lisinopril treatment. 5. Overall,  the changes in tissue ACE after the administration of inhibitors more closely  parallel the drugs' biological effects than changes in plasma ACE or drug levels.  ACE in the testis and brain is protected by permeability barriers that limit  access of the drugs.","1992","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","7-12","","","19","","Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 1327597","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Autoradiography; Kidney/enzymology; Indoles/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Lung/enzymology; Lisinopril; Perindopril; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Benzazepines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Blood Vessels/enzymology; Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects; Brain/enzymology; Dipeptides/administration & dosage/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The comparative effects  of ACEI and ARB on potassium handling have not been investigated. The objective  of this study was to determine whether there are differences in dynamic renal  potassium handling between ACEI and ARB in response to an oral potassium  challenge. This was a randomized crossover study of candesartan versus lisinopril  titrated to control BP followed by an inpatient study of renal potassium handling  in 24 hypertensive patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DMII) and preserved  renal function. Following an oral potassium challenge (0.75 mmol/kg), differences  in hourly serum K (mmol/L), rate of urinary potassium excretion (UkV,  micromol/min), and fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) were assessed by  repeated-measures ANOVA. Hourly UkV(p = .45) and FEK (p = .19) were similar for  candesartan and lisinopril, although FEK at 2 hours for candesartan tended to  exceed that for lisinopril (.34 [.04] vs. .26 [.03]) and approached significance  (p = .096). UkVfor candesartan at hour 2 was 177 (26) and 121 (21) for lisinopril  and also approached significance (p = .10). Serial serum potassium did not differ  (p = .70). No statistical differences were discovered in renal potassium handling  between candesartan and lisinopril in patients with DMII and preserved renal  function. Whether there are differences between the drug classes in renal  impairment remains to be determined.","2002-07","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","754-761","","7","42","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12092742","","","","Adult; Humans; Analysis of Variance; Administration, Oral; Cross-Over Studies; Kidney/*physiopathology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*metabolism; Biphenyl Compounds; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use; Lisinopril/therapeutic use; Potassium/blood/*urine; Tetrazoles/therapeutic use; Urodynamics/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, aspirin,  lisinopril dihydrate, and atorvastatin calcium trihydrate were used as exemplar  cardiovascular drugs and formulated into MN arrays using two biocompatible  polymers, poly(vinylpyrrollidone) and poly(methylvinylether/maleic acid).  Following fabrication, dissolution, mechanical testing, and determination of drug  recovery from the MN arrays, in vitro drug delivery studies were undertaken,  followed by HPLC analysis. All three drugs were successfully delivered in vitro  across neonatal porcine skin, with similar permeation profiles achieved from both  polymer formulations. An average of 126.3 ± 18.1 μg of atorvastatin calcium  trihydrate was delivered, notably lower than the 687.9 ± 101.3 μg of lisinopril  and 3924 ± 1011 μg of aspirin, because of the hydrophobic nature of the  atorvastatin molecule and hence poor dissolution from the array. Polymer  deposition into the skin may be an issue with repeat application of such a MN  array, hence future work will consider more appropriate MN systems for continuous  use, alongside tailoring delivery to less hydrophilic compounds.","2015-10","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","3490-3500","","10","104","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26149914","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Drug Combinations; Swine; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; dissolution; HPLC; Drug Delivery Systems; Atorvastatin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Microinjections; Animals, Newborn; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Lisinopril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Administration, Cutaneous; Aspirin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Cardiovascular Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; formulation; mechanical properties; permeability; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; polymeric drug delivery systems; skin; transdermal drug delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ang-(1-7), as a ligand of the Mas receptor, has inhibitory  effects on renal inflammation and fibrosis in experimental diabetes. However,  Ang-(1-7) has a short half-life in plasma, which may render it unsuitable for use  in clinics. Here, we investigated the effects of the lanthionine-stabilized  Ang-(1-7), cyclic (c)Ang-(1-7), a lanthipeptide that is more peptidase-resistant  than the linear peptide, in BTBR ob/ob mice with type 2 diabetic nephropathy.  BTBR ob/ob mice received vehicle, cAng-(1-7), or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril.  The treatment started at ten weeks of age, when the animals had already developed  albuminuria, and ended at 19-20 weeks of age. cAng-(1-7) limited albuminuria  progression, and limited podocyte dysfunction similarly to lisinopril.  cAng-(1-7), unlike lisinopril, reduced glomerular fibrosis and inflammation, and  counteracted glomerular capillary rarefaction. Furthermore, when cAng-(1-7) was  combined with lisinopril, a superior antiproteinuric effect than with lisinopril  alone was found, in association with better preservation of podocyte proteins and  amelioration of capillary density. Thus, adding cAng-(1-7) to ACE-inhibitor  therapy could benefit those diabetic patients who do not respond completely to  ACE-inhibitor therapy.","2019-10","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","906-917","","4","96","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Combination of amlodipine  (6.0±0.4 mg/day) and lisinopril (12.0±0.9 mg/day) was given to 30 patients (age  40-65 years) with stage I-II AH and DM type 2) for 24 weeks. All patients  underwent ambulatory BP monitoring. Parameter studied comprised glucose levels,  glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), basal insulin, lipid profile in the venous blood  and insulin resistance (IR). All patients received glucose-lowering drugs and  followed diet recommendations. RESULTS: All patients achieved target BP values  and concentrations of HbAlc. After 24 weeks of treatment the following parameters  were significantly different from baseline values: mean systolic BP (SBP)  (-15.6%), mean diastolic BP (DBP), (-16.2%), time index (pressure load--PL) SBP  day (-50.1%), PL DBP day (-51.3), PL DBP night (-59.2%), SBP variability  (-15.8%), values of morning SBP and DBP increase (both -41.8%), rates of morning  rise of SBP (-74.1%) and DBP (-65.8%), percentage of patients with increased  variability of SBP (-36.7%), of DBP (- 23.3%), of SBP day (-36.7%), of DBP day  (-30.0%). Significant decreases of fasting blood glucose level (-22.1%),  concentrations of total cholesterol (-8.8%), low density lipoprotein cholesterol  (-15%), triglycerides (-4.4%), and metabolic index (-32.7%) were also observed.  CONCLUSION: In patients with hypertension and type 2 DM 24 week antihypertensive  therapy with lisinopril and amlodipine significantly improved circadian blood  pressure profile, reduced severity of IR without negative effect on carbohydrate  and lipid metabolism.","2014","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","20-24","","11","54","","Kardiologiia","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 25902654","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Biological Availability; Drug Monitoring; Drug Combinations; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use; Circadian Rhythm/*drug effects; Lipid Metabolism/drug effects; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Russia; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; *Amlodipine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Hypertension/blood/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy; *Lisinopril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/complications/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 360 patients with AH  of the second degree, steatosis and alcoholic HC of class A according to  Child-Pue participated in the study. The control group consisted of 120 patients  with peptic ulcer in remission and normal function of the liver. The patients'  treatment with enalapril (pharmacologically inactive prodrug), lisinopril  (biologically active substance), atenolol (hydrophilic drug) and metoprolol  (lipophylic drug) was analysed. RESULTS: Lisinopril showed a better hypotensive  effect than enalapril in AH patients with HC. BAB decreased blood pressure in all  hypertensive patients. Atenolol and metoprolol effectively reduced blood pressure  in 88.89% patients with AH and HC. Bradycardia episodes in atenolol treatment  were observed in 14.4% patients while in metoprolol treatment--in 22.2% patients,  this evidencing for pronounced shifts in pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol  exposed to hepatic metabolism. CONCLUSION: Biological activity is an essential  criterion of choice of ACE inhibitor in patients with hepatic pathology.  Enalapril, for example, as a pharmacological inactive prodrug, is metabolized in  the liver to acquire activity, whereas lisinopril has a direct biological  activity and has, therefore, a stronger hypotensive action in AH patients with  HC. BAB should be selected by the ability to effectively control blood pressure  and heart rate without inducing bradycardia the appearance of which necessitates  correction of dose regimen with reduction of day dose.","2011","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","49-55","","12","83","","Ter Arkh","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 22416445","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Treatment Outcome; Liver/metabolism; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Chronic Disease; Fatty Liver/*complications/metabolism; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Liver Cirrhosis/*complications/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blockade of the rabbit  apical AT(1) receptor or knockout of the mouse AT(1A) receptor eliminates these  effects, demonstrating a requirement for luminal ANG II that the PT itself  synthesizes. In the present study, we examined the effects of the ACE inhibitor  lisinopril on J(HCO(3)) in isolated perfused rabbit PTs (S2 segment), using  out-of-equilibrium solutions to make isolated changes in [CO(2)](BL) at a fixed  baseline HCO(3)(-) concentration of 22 mM and fixed baseline pH of 7.4. Adding 60  or 240 nM lisinopril (in vitro K(i): 0.5 or 1.2 nM) to the lumen had no effect.  These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that the PT secretes either  angiotensinogen or ANG I. However, adding 60 nM basolateral lisinopril  significantly decreased J(HCO(3)) at a [CO(2)](BL) of 20%. Moreover, 240 nM  basolateral lisinopril decreased baseline (i.e., at 5% CO(2)) J(HCO(3)) by  one-half and completely eliminated the response to altering [CO(2)](BL) from 0 to  20%, but left intact the stimulatory effect of 10(-11) M basolateral ANG II. At  extremely high concentrations (i.e., 100 microM), luminal lisinopril replicated  the effects of 240 nM basolateral lisinopril. Our data are consistent with the  hypothesis that lisinopril readily crosses the basolateral (but not apical)  membrane to block ACE in a vesicular compartment. We conclude that the isolated  PT predominantly secretes preformed ANG II, rather than angiotensinogen or ANG I.","2008-01","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","F245-252","","1","294","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17913836","","","","Female; Animals; Rabbits; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Angiotensin II/*metabolism; Angiotensin I/metabolism; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/metabolism; Renin-Angiotensin System/physiology; Lisinopril/pharmacology; Absorption/drug effects/physiology; Angiotensinogen/metabolism; Bicarbonates/*metabolism; Carbon Dioxide/*metabolism/pharmacology; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower proteinuria and are  renoprotective. However, large inter-individual variation in antiproteinuric  response to ACE inhibitors exists. In this study, we explored the mechanism of  therapeutic resistance to an ACE inhibitor in the rat 5/6 nephrectomy model. At  week 6 after 5/6 nephrectomy, treatment with lisinopril was initiated for 6  weeks. Proteinuria and blood pressure were evaluated weekly. At the end of the  experiment, rats were divided into tertiles according to their antiproteinuric  response: (1) responders (n=9), (2) intermediate responders (n=8) and (3)  non-responders to ACE inhibitor therapy (n=9). At the start of treatment,  proteinuria had progressively increased to 154 (95% confidence interval [CI]:  123-185) mg/24 h in the entire cohort, with comparable proteinuria and blood  pressure in all groups. Following treatment with ACE inhibitor, proteinuria was  significantly lower in the responders (68, CI: 46-89 mg/24 h) compared to the  non-responders (251, CI: 83-420) mg/24 h). Similarly, blood pressure was reduced  in the responders, but unaffected in the non-responders. At autopsy, renal ACE  activity and renal ACE expression were significantly lower in the responders  compared to the non-responders. Although lisinopril intake was comparable in all  animals, urinary drug excretion was increased in the non-responders,  demonstrating increased drug clearance. Average urinary lisinopril excretion was  correlated with antiproteinuric response (R(2)=0.32, P=0.003). In conclusion,  both pharmacodynamic and -kinetic factors account for the non-response to  lisinopril. Whether these can be overcome simply by increasing drug dosage in  non-responders should be investigated.","2008-02-02","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","231-240","","1-2","580","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 18036585","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Disease Models, Animal; Rats, Wistar; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Nephrectomy; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; *Drug Resistance; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Lisinopril/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/drug effects/metabolism; Proteinuria/*drug therapy/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE) has been previously shown to cleave gastrin analogs in vitro. In the  present study, we have assessed the effects induced by single or dual  NEP/ACE-inhibition on the pharmacokinetic profile of three (99m)Tc-labeled  gastrins of varying peptide chain length: [(99m)Tc]SG6  ([(99m)Tc-N4-Gln(1)]gastrin(1-17)), [(99m)Tc]DG2  ([(99m)Tc-N4-Gly(4),DGlu(5)]gastrin(4-17)) and [(99m)Tc]DG4  ([(99m)Tc-N4-DGlu(10)]gastrin(10-17)). METHODS: Mouse blood samples were  collected 5min after injection of each of [(99m)Tc]SG6/DG2/DG4 together with: a)  vehicle, b) the NEP-inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA), c) the ACE-inhibitor  lisinopril (Lis), or d) PA plus Lis and were analyzed by RP-HPLC for  radiometabolite detection. Biodistribution was studied in SCID mice bearing  A431-CCK2R(+/-) xenografts at 4h postinjection (pi). [(99m)Tc]SG6 or [(99m)Tc]DG4  was coinjected with either vehicle or the above described NEP/ACE-inhibitor  regimens; for [(99m)Tc]DG2 control and PA animal groups were only included.  RESULTS: Treatment of mice with PA induced significant stabilization of  (99m)Tc-radiotracers in peripheral blood, while treatment with Lis or Lis+PA  affected the stability of des(Glu)5 [(99m)Tc]DG4 only. In line with these  findings, PA coinjection led to notable amplification of tumor uptake of  radiopeptides compared to controls (P<0.01). Only [(99m)Tc]DG4 profited by single  Lis (2.06±0.39%ID/g vs 0.99±0.13%ID/g in controls) or combined Lis+PA coinjection  (8.91±1.61%ID/g vs 4.89±1.33%ID/g in PA-group). Furthermore, kidney uptake  remained favourably low and unaffected by PA and/or Lis coinjection only in the  case of [(99m)Tc]DG4 (<1.9%ID/g) resulting in the most optimal tumor-to-kidney  ratios. CONCLUSIONS: In situ NEP/ACE-inhibition diversely affected the in vivo  profile of (99m)Tc-radioligands based on different-length gastrins. Truncated  [(99m)Tc]DG4 exhibited overall the most attractive profile during combined  NEP/ACE-inhibition in mouse models, providing new opportunities for  CCK2R-expressing tumor imaging in man with SPECT.","2016-06","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","347-354","","6","43","","Nucl Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The combination of different measures that serve  maximization of RAS blockade is thought to improve the antiproteinuric efficacy.  The feasibility and the efficacy of such a combination strategy were studied in  nondiabetic patients with residual proteinuria during previous RAS blockade by  individual antiproteinuric titration. Previous medication was replaced by  irbesartan 300 mg combined with a diuretic. Lisinopril was added in increasing  doses until a maximal dose of 40 mg/d. Titration stopped when target proteinuria  (< 1 g/d) was reached or further dose titration was not tolerated because of side  effects. Residual proteinuria (median, 3.2 g/d; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to  5.2 g/d) was significantly reduced with 55.6% (95% confidence interval, 16.0 to  73.2%; P < 0.02) on the maximal additional tolerated dose of lisinopril. The  maximal dose of lisinopril was 10 mg in two of eight, 20 mg in two of eight, 30  mg in one of eight, and 40 mg in three of eight patients. At this dose, target  proteinuria of < 1 g/d was reached in two of eight patients. The number of  patients with adverse events during dose titration was five of eight patients:  two had cough; two had hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mmol/L), one of whom had > 50%  increase of serum creatinine; and one had dizziness. In conclusion, individual  titration for maximal RAS blockade, entailing dose titration of  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on top of high-dose angiotensin II  antagonists with diuretic, induces further reduction of residual proteinuria.  However, this occurs at the expense of adverse events. To further improve  renoprotective treatment strategies, it is important to explore other modes of  antiproteinuric intervention in patients with residual proteinuria during RAS  blockade.","2005-03","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","S53-57","","","16 Suppl 1","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15938035","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Follow-Up Studies; Risk Assessment; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Treatment Outcome; Biological Availability; Drug Administration Schedule; Confidence Intervals; Probability; Patient Selection; Drug Therapy, Combination; Urinalysis; Severity of Illness Index; Kidney Function Tests; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects; Irbesartan; Lisinopril/*administration & dosage; Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage; Kidney Diseases/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Proteinuria/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy; Tetrazoles/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A  4,500-fold purification was achieved after affinity chromatography with  lisinopril-Sepharose and gel filtration. The final preparation was judged to be  homogenous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an  apparent molecular weight of 160,000. The purified protein is a glycoenzyme  containing 12% N-linked carbohydrate. Purified ACE had a specific activity of 65  U/mg protein with benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu as substrate. A kinetic analysis showed  that the enzyme had the maximal velocity with substrates containing proline at  the COOH-terminal end. Inhibitor studies indicated that the enzyme is a  metalloprotein. Along the proximal-distal axis of the small intestine, ACE  activity is most predominant in the proximal to middle portions, decreasing  toward the distal end. This pattern was also observed for ACE mRNA and protein,  suggesting that ACE expression is controlled at the level of mRNA. Perfusion of  benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu in vivo through a segment of intestinal jejunum demonstrated  that ACE is an important intestinal dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, participating in  the digestion and assimilation of dietary peptides.","1992-10","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","G466-473","","4 Pt 1","263","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1329552","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Perfusion; Molecular Sequence Data; Amino Acid Sequence; Tissue Distribution; Blotting, Western; Blotting, Northern; Chemistry; Chemical Phenomena; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/*enzymology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Oligopeptides/pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/isolation & purification/*metabolism/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although many properties of the DTS have been elucidated, including  isolation of the carrier protein, little is known about the distribution of this  transporter along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The objectives of the present  study were to (1) validate that SQ-29852 (a lysylproline ACE inhibitor) is a  stable and specific probe for evaluation of the DTS in rats and (2) provide  fundamental in vivo information on the distribution of the DTS along the GI tract  of rats. Most of the previous studies that explored the location of the DTS  typically involved either in vitro uptake or in situ disappearance of unstable or  nonspecific probes. SQ-29852, on the other hand, is an ideal probe for evaluation  of the DTS because it is chemically and metabolically stable and it is absorbed  almost exclusively by the DTS. SQ-29852 appears to be a specific probe for the  DTS because the dose-dependent reduction in absorption from about 60% to less  than 8% (3 and 3000 mg/kg, respectively) suggests that at least 85% of an orally  administered low dose of SQ-29852 is absorbed by a saturable process, which was  shown previously to be the DTS. [14C]SQ-29852 was administered by gavage to  intact rats and via an indwelling cannula in one of the following sections of the  intestine: duodenum, jejunum, ileum and proximal colon (n = 4 for each site). On  the basis of the recovery of [14C]SQ-29852 in urine, the DTS is apparently  distributed throughout the entire GI tract of rats, including the proximal colon.  The present results are consistent with previously reported results on the  absorption of natural dipeptides in humans and rats and immunohistochemical  evaluation in rats; however, they disagree with a recent report in humans with  amoxicillin. This difference is discussed in terms of the specificity and  stability of various drugs that have been used as probes of the DTS.","1996-03","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","282-286","","3","85","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8699329","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Digestive System/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism; Dipeptides/*metabolism; Organophosphorus Compounds/*metabolism; Proline/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The following variables were measured: blood flow rate,  peripheral vascular resistance indices at the extra- and intracranial levels,  metabolic indices of cerebrovascular responsiveness, and coefficient of  variability as an indicator of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity under  conditions of antihypertensive treatment. Three antihypertensive therapeutic  regimens were employed, viz. lisinopril plus indapamide, bisoprolol plus  indapamide, and amlodipine plus indapamide. It was shown that all the three  regimen resulted in positive changes in the parameters of blood flow and  peripheral vascular resistance. At the same time, the use of amlodipine plus  indapamide ensured a more gradual reduction of peripheral vascular resistance and  the most pronounced increase of cerebrovascular reserve capacity compared with  the two remaining regimens.

Both  rapid-release and coat-core formulations are available for clinical use, but only  the coat-core formulation extends antihypertensive, antiischemic, and antianginal  effects throughout the dosing interval when given once daily. The coat-core  formulation in daily doses of 10 to 40 mg does not cause the proischemic effects  reported with the rapid-release formulation. When given as monotherapy, the  coat-core formulation is highly effective in lowering blood pressure to a similar  extent as other long-acting calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers,  or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The antihypertensive effects  are potentiated when the coat-core formulation of nisoldipine is given in  combination with lisinopril. In patients with stable angina pectoris nisoldipine  coat-core increases exercise duration, reduces anginal frequency and myocardial  ischemia, and is effective as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-blockers.  In monotherapy the drug is as effective as other long-acting calcium channel  blockers or a beta-blocker. The effects of nisoldipine coat-core in patients with  heart failure are unclear at present.","1999-12","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","279-288","","5","1","","Heart Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11720635","","","","Humans; Angina Pectoris/*drug therapy; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Calcium Channel Blockers/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Nisoldipine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In  male MWF rats, which develop spontaneous proteinuria with age, ACE inhibitors  prevent proteinuria and increase glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. These  renoprotective effects are not associated with ultrastructural changes of  capillary wall components. This study was undertaken to investigate whether ACE  inhibitors modulate functional properties of glomerular basement membrane (GBM)  and/or of epithelial cells, both of which have been suggested to play a role in  the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. The hydraulic and  macromolecular permeability of the GBM were determined, by an in vitro filtration  system, in untreated or lisinopril-treated rats and in Wistar rats taken as  controls. By indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy,  glomerular distribution of the tight junction protein zonula occludens- (ZO-1), a  component of the slit diaphragm, was also studied. Results document that  spontaneous proteinuria in MWF rats develops without significant changes in the  permeability of the GBM to water and albumin, or in the ultrastructure of the  podocyte foot processes, but is associated with an important alteration in the  distribution of ZO-1 at the glomerular level. Lisinopril, which prevented  proteinuria, also prevented glomerular redistribution of the protein. Thus,  renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors are not associated with changes in  intrinsic functional properties of GBM, or ultrastructural changes of the  epithelial cells, but rather with preservation of glomerular ZO-1 distribution  and slit diaphragm function, which are essential for maintaining the filtration  barrier.","2000-03","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","477-489","","3","11","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10703671","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Tissue Distribution; Membrane Proteins/*metabolism; Permeability/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Lisinopril/*pharmacology; Basement Membrane/*metabolism; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Kidney Glomerulus/*metabolism/pathology; Microscopy, Immunoelectron; Phosphoproteins/*metabolism; Proteinuria/genetics/*metabolism/pathology; Rats, Mutant Strains/genetics; Zonula Occludens-1 Protein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the transport mechanisms for resveratrol  glucuronides are not fully established. Here, we aimed to characterize the efflux  transport of resveratrol glucuronides using UGT1A1-overexpressing HeLa cells  (HeLa1A1 cells), and to determine the contribution of multidrug  resistance-associated protein (MRP) 4 to cellular excretion of the glucuronides.  Two glucuronide isomers [i.e., resveratrol 3-O-glucuronide (R3G) and resveratrol  4'-O-glucuronide (R4'G)] were excreted into the extracellular compartment after  incubation of resveratrol (1-100 μM) with HeLa1A1 cells. The excretion rate was  linearly related to the level of intracellular glucuronide, indicating that  glucuronide efflux was a nonsaturable process. MK-571 (a dual inhibitor of UGT1A1  and MRPs) significantly decreased the excretion rates of R3G and R4'G while  increasing their intracellular levels. Likewise, short-hairpin RNA  (shRNA)-mediated silencing of MRP4 caused a significant reduction in glucuronide  excretion but an elevation in glucuronide accumulation. Furthermore,  β-glucuronidase expressed in the cells catalyzed the hydrolysis of the  glucuronides back to the parent compound. A cellular pharmacokinetic model  integrating resveratrol transport/metabolism with glucuronide  hydrolysis/excretion was well fitted to the experimental data, allowing  derivation of the efflux rate constant values in the absence or presence of shRNA  targeting MRP4. It was found that a large percentage of glucuronide excretion  (43%-46%) was attributed to MRP4. In conclusion, MRP4 participated in cellular  excretion of R3G and R4'G. Integration of mechanistic pharmacokinetic modeling  with transporter knockdown was a useful method to derive the contribution  percentage of an exporter to overall glucuronide excretion.","2016-04","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","485-488","","4","44","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26758854","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; HeLa Cells; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Biological Transport/drug effects/physiology; Glucuronides/*metabolism; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism; Lisinopril/metabolism/pharmacology; *Transfection/methods; Extracellular Fluid/drug effects/*metabolism; Glucuronosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism; Stilbenes/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we determined how often  ACE levels were measured in patients receiving ACEI therapy. METHODS: ACE levels  analyzed over a 54-month preintervention time period at an academic medical  center were reviewed retrospectively for tests performed during ACEI therapy.  These data were compared with a large, deidentified dataset of ACE levels  measured at a national reference laboratory; in vitro studies of ACEI inhibition;  and liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection of  lisinopril in a subset of clinical specimens. RESULTS: Over a 54-month period,  1,292 patients had ACE levels measured, with 108 patients (8.4%) receiving ACEI  therapy at the time of testing. ACE levels measured for patients receiving ACEI  therapy were substantially lower. In general, clinical teams did not recognize a  medication effect on ACE levels. Introduction of a warning prompt in the  electronic health record reduced the ordering of ACE levels in patients receiving  ACEIs by > 60% in a 17-month postintervention time period. The deidentified  dataset of ACE levels at a reference laboratory showed a bimodal distribution,  with a peak of very low ACE levels. Using liquid chromatography time-of-flight  mass spectrometry, the presence of lisinopril was confirmed in a subset of  specimens with low ACE activity. In vitro studies of two different ACE assays  showed significant inhibition of activity at clinically relevant concentrations.  CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of ACE activity is often measured for patients receiving  ACEIs, potentially leading to low ACE concentrations and inaccurate  interpretations.","2015-12","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","1447-1453","","6","148","","Chest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26225637","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Biological Availability; United States; Retrospective Studies; Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Diagnostic Errors/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data; *Lisinopril/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/analysis/blood; Sarcoidosis/*blood/diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  169 patients on monotherapy for high blood pressure underwent electronic  adherence monitoring for 3 months. Blood pressures were measured during non-study  office visits and were retrieved from automated medical records. Questionnaires  were used to obtain other covariate information. The ratio of the dosing interval  to the half-life of drug activity (I') was used to capture conformity with FDA  guidelines. Data analysis focused on the interaction between I' and the impact on  blood pressure of delayed dosing. RESULTS: The average (+/- standard deviation)  blood pressure during the study was 139.0(+/- 12.0)/85.0(+/- 6.9) mm Hg.

The assay is based on gas chromatography/negative ion chemical  ionization mass spectrometry. The preparation of stable isotope labelled  lisinopril for use as an internal standard is described. The method involves  solid phase extraction on C18 sorbent and derivatization to the methyl  diester-trifluoroacetamide derivatives. The detection limit was found to be 50 pg  and a lower limit of quantification was reached down to 0.5 ng/mL plasma.","1998","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","1591-1594","","21","12","","Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9807834","","","","Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Mass Spectrometry; Indicators and Reagents; Chromatography, Gas; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*blood/pharmacokinetics; Lisinopril/*blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lisinopril is a potent angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitor. Administered in doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day, it improves the  functional and haemodynamic state of patients whose congestive heart failure is  refractory to the digitalis-diuretic treatment. The drug is well tolerated, and  no severe side-effects have been reported. Lisinopril seems to be at least as  effective as captopril in congestive heart failure, and it has over the latter  the advantage of a once a day dosage therapy.","1990-10-11","2022-11-17 16:30:35","2022-11-17 16:30:35","","53-58","","23 Suppl","40","","Rev Prat","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 2176346","","","","Humans; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Lisinopril; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Enalapril/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Captopril/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
