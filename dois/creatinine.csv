However, the serum concentration  reflects not only renal excretion, which is composed of filtration and tubular  secretion, but also the generation, intake, and metabolism of creatinine. Thus,  serum creatinine does not provide an adequate estimate of glomerular filtration  rate (GFR). Creatinine clearance is also an inaccurate and imprecise measure of  GFR in clinical practice. The questions concerning the abnormality or the change  of glomerular function can be answered with greater accuracy and precision by  serum creatinine if the factors affecting its concentration are taken into  account. The slope of the decline in reciprocal serum creatinine versus time does  not accurately reflect changes in creatinine clearance and does not allow an  accurate assessment of the rate of progression of renal disease. It can even be  hazardous to use such value to observe the efficacy of treatments for progressive  renal diseases.","1992","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","73-81","","2","13","","Nephrologie","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 1608500","","","","Humans; Metabolic Clearance Rate; *Kidney Function Tests; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney/physiology; Creatinine/*blood/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the pharmacokinetic parameters and serum  concentrations of ceftazidime (CF) and cefepime (CE) in burn patients and  analyzed the modifications according to clinical and biological parameters and in  particular age and creatinine clearance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two  pharmacokinetic studies were carried out with daily doses of 1 g x 6 for CF (n =  17) and 2 g x 3 for CE (n = 13). Creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) was both estimated  and measured. Blood was sampled at steady state after an initial and a subsequent  antibiotic dose. C(max) (maximal) and C(min) (minimal) concentrations were  measured by HPLC. The influence of clinical and biological data was analyzed  using ANOVA, ANCOVA and stepwise multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The ratio  of C(min) to the low MIC break point (4 mg/l) was lower than 4 in 52% of subjects  receiving CF and in 80% of subjects receiving CE. The C(min) of CF was correlated  with measured CL(CR) and was higher in mechanically ventilated patients than in  non-ventilated patients. The clearance of CF was correlated with age. The C(min)  of CE was correlated with age and drug clearance with measured CL(CR). Therefore  dosage adjustment of these drugs in burn patients needs to take into account age,  measured creatinine clearance and the danger of low concentrations occurring when  the creatinine clearance is greater than 120 ml x min(-1). CONCLUSION: In burn  patients, the pharmacokinetic disposition of CF and CE was much more variable  than in healthy subjects. Age and CL(CR) were predictors of the disposition of  these antibiotics. Shortening the dosage interval or using continuous infusions  will prevent low serum levels and keep trough levels above the MIC for longer  periods of time. In view of the lack of a bedside measurement technique for  ceftazidime and cefepime levels, we suggest a more frequent use of measured  CL(CR) in order to attain efficacious clinical concentrations.","2007-10","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","529-538","","10","45","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 17966838","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Age Factors; Drug Administration Schedule; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/blood/urine; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Cephalosporins/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Ceftazidime/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Burns/*drug therapy/metabolism; Cefepime; Respiration, Artificial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested 14 compounds (cimetidine, cobicistat,  dolutegravir, dronedarone, DX-619, famotidine, INCB039110, nizatidine,  ondansetron, pyrimethamine, rabeprazole, ranolazine, trimethoprim, and  vandetanib), which were reported to cause reversible changes in SCr and/or  CL(cre) in healthy subjects excluding elderly.

For 7 and 9 out of these compounds, changes in SCr and/or CL(cre)  were estimated within 2- and 3-fold of observed values, respectively. Less than  10% changes in SCr and/or CL(cre) caused by cobicistat, dolutegravir, and  rabeprazole were reproduced as such by our method.

METHODS: Serum  creatinine measurements in the preoperative (baseline) and postoperative periods  of urogynecologic surgeries were determined and the correlation of the change to  ureteral injury and/or obstruction analyzed. The sample size calculation showed 7  cases and 28 controls were sufficient to detect significant changes in  creatinine. Each of the seven cases was matched for age and type of surgery with  a control patient in a 1:4 ratio following standard protocol. RESULTS: Chart  review of patients (273 cases) undergoing urogynecologic surgeries from October  2009 to June 2014 were undertaken. There were 7 cases of ureteral injury and 28  matching control cases. All cases had intraoperative cystoscopy confirming  bilateral ureteral flow. In the ureteral injury group, blockage of ureter was  confirmed by CT scan with IV contrast. There was a 59.8% increase in serum  creatinine levels postoperative in the ureteral injury group versus a 3.8%  decrease in controls. A difference of creatinine levels greater than or equal to  0.3 mg/dL over baseline was evident in ureteral injury cases. CONCLUSION: A small  change in serum creatinine level over baseline after urogynecologic surgery  alerted the possibility of ureteral injury or obstruction. A simple and  inexpensive evaluation of perioperative creatinine levels can promptly diagnose  ureteral damage in the acute postoperative period for gynecologic reconstructive  surgeries.","2017-11","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1915-1919","","11","49","","Int Urol Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 28861678","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Aged; Area Under Curve; Creatinine; ROC Curve; Retrospective Studies; Perioperative Period; Creatinine/*blood; Ureter; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures/adverse effects; Surgery injury; Ureter/*injuries; Ureteral Obstruction/*blood/*diagnosis/etiology; Urogynecology; Urologic Surgical Procedures/adverse effects; Wounds and Injuries/*blood/*diagnosis/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES:  Literature was searched in PubMed (1965-June 2012) by using the key words and  MeSH terms urinary tract infections-drug therapy, chronic kidney insufficiency,  kidney diseases, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy, combined with  nitrofurantoin. Articles were limited to the English language. References from  the identified studies, Food and Drug Administration-approved product information  packets, drug information resources, and pharmacology books were also reviewed.  DATA SYNTHESIS: The contraindication of nitrofurantoin in patients with a CrCl  below 60 mL/min was included in the product information packets sometime between  1988 and 2003. The 1988 Macrodantin product information indicated a CrCl cutoff  level of 40 mL/min, but the current contraindication of less than 60 mL/min is  found in the 2003 Macrobid product information. It is unclear when and why this  change occurred, but it may have followed the work of Sachs and colleagues in  1968, who reported very little drug recovery in the urine of patients with a CrCl  below 60 mL/min. This and previous studies have several and severe limitations,  such as the inclusion of a small number of patients, an undefined or poorly  defined method to determine CrCl and renal impairment, measurement of amounts of  nitrofurantoin excreted in the urine instead of urinary concentrations, and most  importantly, a lack of clinical efficacy end points. More recently, a chart  review on clinical cure of urinary tract infections treated with nitrofurantoin  provided grounds for further investigations on the utility of this drug for  patients with a CrCl of 60 mL/min or lower. Concerns of increased risks of  serious adverse reactions in patients with reduced renal function have further  limited the use of nitrofurantoin. However, although not completely clear, these  complications seem to be linked most often to prolonged treatment, genetic  variability, and predisposition to hypersensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Data supporting  the contraindication of nitrofurantoin for patients with a CrCl less than 60  mL/min are nonexistent. Well-designed clinical trials with urinary concentration  information and clinical end points on patients with various degrees of renal  impairment are much needed. Until such a study becomes available, the limited  data available would support considering using this drug in patients with a CrCl  of 40 mL/min or higher.","2013-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","106-111","","1","47","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23341159","","","","Humans; Kidney Function Tests; Contraindications; Creatinine/blood/urine; Kidney Diseases/*physiopathology; *Anti-Infective Agents, Urinary/adverse effects/therapeutic use; *Nitrofurantoin/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Urinary Tract Infections/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on current evidence, creatinine can be taken up into renal  proximal tubule cells by the basolaterally localized organic cation transporter 2  (OCT2) and the organic anion transporter 2, and effluxed into the urine by the  apically localized multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) and MATE2K.  Drug-induced elevation of serum creatinine (SCr) and/or reduced creatinine renal  clearance is routinely used as a marker for acute kidney injury. Interpretation  of elevated SCr can be complex, because such increases can be reversible and  explained by inhibition of renal transporters involved in active secretion of  creatinine or other secondary factors, such as diet and disease state.  Distinction between these possibilities is important from a drug development  perspective, as increases in SCr can result in the termination of otherwise  efficacious drug candidates. In this review, we discuss the challenges associated  with using creatinine as a marker for kidney damage. Furthermore, to evaluate  whether reversible changes in SCr can be predicted prospectively based on in  vitro transporter inhibition data, an in-depth in vitro-in vivo correlation  (IVIVC) analysis was conducted for 16 drugs with in-house and literature in vitro  transporter inhibition data for OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K, as well as total and  unbound maximum plasma concentration (Cmax and Cmax,u) data measured in the  clinic.","2016-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1498-1509","","9","44","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26825641","","","","Humans; Kidney/*metabolism; Biomarkers/metabolism; *Drug Design; Kidney Function Tests; Creatinine/*blood; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Organic Cation Transporter 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was a wide  scatter of CCr about each Se-C value. Se-C was higher in males than females and  in hypertensives than normotensives, but the differences were not statistically  significant.

Crude CCr was significantly higher in men than women (P <  0.05) in the whole group but not significantly in the normotensive or  hypertensive subgroups. After adjustment, the differences diminished and became  insignificant in the whole group. Some subgroups had identical mean Se-C values  but different adjusted CCr. A particular Se-C value did not always indicate a  particular CCr. Adjustment of CCr to 1.73 m2 BSA reduced the variability between  Se-C and CCr and the difference between the genders.

Because of immaturity of clearance mechanisms, quantification of renal function  in neonates is of importance. Several serum creatinine (SCr)-based renal function  descriptors have been developed in adults and children, but none are selectively  derived for neonates. This review summarizes development of the neonatal kidney  and discusses assessment of the renal function regarding estimation of glomerular  filtration rate using renal function descriptors. Furthermore, identification of  the renal function descriptors that best describe the variability of vancomycin  clearance was performed in a sample study of a septic neonatal cohort. Population  pharmacokinetic models were developed applying a combination of age-weight, renal  function descriptors, or SCr alone. In addition to age and weight, SCr or renal  function descriptors significantly reduced variability of vancomycin clearance.  The population pharmacokinetic models with Léger and modified Schwartz formulas  were selected as the optimal final models, although the other renal function  descriptors and SCr provided reasonably good fit to the data, suggesting further  evaluation of the final models using external data sets and cross validation. The  present study supports incorporation of renal function descriptors in the  estimation of vancomycin clearance in neonates.","2016-05","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","528-540","","5","56","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26412385","","","","Humans; Metabolic Clearance Rate; population pharmacokinetics; Infant, Newborn; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Vancomycin/*pharmacokinetics; Kidney/metabolism/*physiology; infectious diseases; neonatology; nephrology; special populations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We simultaneously evaluated Ccr, inulin clearance, and predicted GFR  calculated from serum creatinine level in 56 cirrhotic patients. Inulin clearance  was considered the gold standard for GFR evaluation. RESULTS: The sensitivity of  serum creatinine level, predicted GFR, and Ccr in detecting renal failure was  18.5%, 51%, and 74%, respectively. On the basis of inulin clearance, patients  were divided into two groups: those with normal GFR (mean, 106 +/- 34 mL/min per  1.73 m2) (group 1, 29 patients) and those with reduced GFR (mean, 56 +/- 19  mL/min per 1.73 m2) (group 2, 27 patients). Predicted GFR and Ccr were accurate  markers of GFR in group 1 patients, while both overestimated GFR by about 50% in  group 2 patients. An increased tubular secretion of creatinine accounted for the  disparity between Ccr and inulin clearance in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our  results indicate that renal failure is greatly underestimated on the basis of  serum creatinine level and Ccr in cirrhotic patients. Clinical implications of  this observation include excessive dosage of potentially nephrotoxic drugs and  failure to recognize renal impairment induced by such medical treatments as  diuretic therapy or paracentesis.","1994-01-24","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","201-205","","2","154","","Arch Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8285815","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Sensitivity and Specificity; Glomerular Filtration Rate/physiology; Creatinine/blood/*metabolism/urine; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology; Liver Cirrhosis/complications/*metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed how  baseline determination impacted AKI incidence and association between AKI and  clinical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively applied empirical (measured serum  creatinine) and imputed (age/height) baseline estimation methods to pediatric  patients discharged between 2014 and 2019 from an academic hospital. Using each  method, we estimated AKI incidence and assessed area under ROC curve (AUROC) for  AKI as a predictor of three clinical outcomes: application of AKI billing code  (proxy for more clinically overt disease), inpatient mortality, and  post-hospitalization chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: Incidence was highly  variable across baseline methods (12.2-26.7%). Incidence was highest when lowest  pre-admission creatinine was used if available and Schwartz bedside equation was  used to impute one otherwise. AKI was more predictive of application of an AKI  billing code when baseline was imputed universally, regardless of pre-admission  values (AUROC 80.7-84.9%) than with any empirical approach (AUROC 64.5-76.6%).  AKI was predictive of post-hospitalization CKD when using universal imputation  baseline methods (AUROC 67.0-74.6%); AKI was not strongly predictive of  post-hospitalization CKD when using empirical baseline methods (AUROC  46.4-58.5%). Baseline determination method did not affect the association between  AKI and inpatient mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Method of baseline determination  influences AKI incidence and association between AKI and clinical outcomes,  illustrating the need for standard criteria.

Serum creatinine was higher by 16% after than before starting ITZ  treatment, while eGFR-cre was lower by 9.3%. The serum creatinine ratio  after/before ITZ treatment was positively correlated with the free plasma  concentration of OH-ITZ. The patients co-treated with  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had higher serum creatinine. Concomitant  glucocorticoid administration did not significantly alter serum cystatin C.  CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hematopoietic or immune-related disorder treated with  oral ITZ had a higher level of serum creatinine. Although serum creatinine  potentially increases in conjunction with the free plasma concentration of  OH-ITZ, concomitant ITZ administration has a slight impact on the eGFR-cre level  in clinical settings.","2021-03","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","369-379","","3","77","","Eur J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 33033881","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Administration, Oral; Pharmacokinetics; Creatinine; Hydroxylation; Itraconazole; Creatinine/blood; Cystatin C/blood; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Cystatin C; Renal function; Metabolite; Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy; Immune System Diseases/*drug therapy; Itraconazole/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the  hypothesis that assessment of creatinine clearance (CrCl) and/or serum Cr may be  a suitable means of monitoring plasma MTX concentrations. METHODS: All children  in the study had ALL or NHL, were in complete remission, and received HDMTX (3 or  5 g/m(2))+leucovorin. Plasma MTX concentrations were measured at 24, 48, and 96  h. CrCl was determined at 24 and 48 h. Correlations between 24- and 48-h plasma  MTX concentrations and CrCl and serum Cr concentrations were determined. CrCl and  serum Cr concentrations were compared over time between children who had delayed  and non-delayed MTX elimination. RESULTS: A total of 105 children were included.  There were significant negative correlations between CrCl at 24 and 48 h and  plasma MTX concentrations at 24 (both p < 0.001) and 48 h (both p < 0.001). There  were significant positive correlations between serum Cr concentrations at both 24  and 48 h and plasma MTX concentrations at 24 (both p < 0.001) and 48 h (both p <  0.001). There were 88 (30.2 %) instances of elimination delay. Children with  elimination delay had significantly lower CrCl and higher Cr concentrations at 24  and 48 h compared with children without elimination delay (all p < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that, with further refinement, assessment of  renal function may be a useful means of monitoring plasma MTX concentrations  during HDMTX for ALL and NHL.","2014-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","79-86","","1","73","","Cancer Chemother Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 24158402","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Child, Preschool; Creatinine/*blood; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy; Methotrexate/blood/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to optimize this strategy for height-independent GFR  estimation in children. METHODS: Retrospective study of 408 inulin clearance  tests with simultaneous International Federation of Clinical Chemistry-calibrated  measurements of creatinine, cystatin C, and urea in children (mean age  12.5 years, GFR 91.2 ml/min/1.73m(2)) comparing the arithmetic (mean(arith)) and  geometric means (mean(geom)) of a height-independent creatinine-based (full age  spectrum, based on age (FASage)) and a cystatin C-based equation (FAScys), with  the complex height-dependent CKiD3 equation incorporating gender, height,  cystatin C, creatinine, and urea. RESULTS: Mean(geom) had a P(30) accuracy of  89.2% compared to mean(arith) 87.7% (p = 0.030) as well as lower bias and  %precision error and performed almost as well as CKiD3 (P(30) accuracy 90.9%).  Modifying the weight of FASage and FAScys when calculating the means showed that  an equal contribution was most accurate in most patients. In spina bifida  patients, FAScys alone outperformed any combination. Malignancy or nephritis  patients had slightly higher accuracy with weighted means favoring cystatin C or  creatinine, respectively. Disagreement between FAScys and FASage was inversely  correlated with the accuracy of mean(geom). When disagreement exceeded 40%,  application of weighted means based on diagnosis improved the performance of  eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of height data, the optimal strategy for  estimating GFR in children is by using the geometric mean of FASage and FAScys.  When there is large disagreement between the two, weighted means based on  diagnosis improve accuracy.","2018-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1553-1563","","9","33","","Pediatr Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 29774462","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Age Factors; Sex Factors; Young Adult; Creatinine; Child; Child, Preschool; Retrospective Studies; Biomarkers/blood/urine; Body Height; Kidney/physiopathology; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Cystatin C; Renal Elimination; Children; Kidney Function Tests/*methods; Creatinine/blood/metabolism/urine; Cystatin C/blood/metabolism/urine; eGFR; Height-independent; Inulin/administration & dosage/blood/metabolism/urine; Kidney Diseases/blood/*diagnosis/physiopathology/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such estimates of creatinine clearance are  widely used for dosage adjustments of drugs which are primarily eliminated  through the kidneys in patients with reduced renal function. Most of these  methods involve the use of equations, requiring a few steps of calculations. A  simple and easy-to-use nomogram is presented for estimating creatinine clearance  from serum creatinine concentration, plus the age, sex, and bodyweight of the  individual patient. This nomogram is based on the linear relationship between  creatinine clearance and the reciprocal value of the serum creatinine  concentration, where the slope of this relationship is determined by the rate of  creatinine production. The rate of creatinine production, however, is related to  age, sex, and bodyweight. These physical characteristics are therefore used to  scale the slopes of the relationships between creatinine clearance and serum  creatinine concentration. The validity of the nomogram was tested in 50  consecutive hospitalised patients for which creatinine clearance was measured.  There was an excellent correlation (r = 0.903) between predicted and observed  creatinine clearance values.","1983-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","365-369","","4","8","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 6617044","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Reference Values; Models, Biological; Sex Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Creatinine/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was ascribed to transient inhibition of  MATE1-mediated renal creatinine secretion. Interestingly, a structurally similar  drug, ritonavir, has not been associated with serum creatinine increases at the  pharmacoenhancer dose. The present study was aimed to investigate the translation  of in vitro MATE1/2K inhibition to clinical creatinine increase (cobicistat) and  lack of it (ritonavir) considering their intracellular concentrations in renal  proximal tubules. Uptake studies showed ritonavir and cobicistat are unlikely  substrates for OCT2. The steady-state unbound concentration in the cytosol of  human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells was comparable with the  extracellular unbound concentration, suggesting that the entry of these compounds  is predominantly mediated by passive diffusion. Ritonavir and cobicistat are  MATE1 and MATE2K inhibitors with IC(50) values of 3.1 and 90 μM (ritonavir), and  4.4 and 3.2 μM (cobicistat), respectively. However, the unbound cytosolic  concentrations (C(u,cytosol)) of ritonavir and cobicistat in human renal proximal  tubule epithelial cells, 0.065 and 0.10 μM, respectively, after incubation with  the clinical maximum total plasma concentrations at pharmacoenhancer doses does  not support inhibition in vivo; C(u,cytosol) >30 fold lower than IC(50)s. These  results demonstrate that MATE1/2K inhibition is unlikely the mechanism of the  clinical creatinine elevations with cobicistat.","2019-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","3118-3123","","9","108","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 American Pharmacists Association®.

Venous and capillary blood samples were taken  predose and at C2 from 65 heart and lung transplant recipients (65 x 4 samples).  For comparisons, serum creatinine and blood CsA concentrations were measured by  the Jaffe and EMIT methods, respectively, using an Olympus AU600 analyzer. For  the LC-MS/MS assay, samples were prepared in a 96 x 700-microL well block by  adding 10 microL of blood (or serum) to 40 microL of 0.1 mol/L zinc sulphate  solution containing deuterated creatinine internal standard. Proteins were  precipitated by adding 100 microL acetonitrile containing ascomycin internal  standard. After vigorous mixing and centrifugation, 5 microL of the supernatant  was injected into the LC-MS/MS system. A Waters 2795 high-performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC) system was used to elute a C18 cartridge (3 mm x 4 mm) at  0.6 mL/min with a step gradient of 50-100% methanol containing 2 mmol/L ammonium  acetate and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The column was maintained at 55 degrees C,  and the retention times were creatinine, 0.4 minutes; ascomycin, 0.98 minutes;  and CsA, 1.2 minutes. Cycle time was 2.5 minutes, injection to injection. The  analytes were monitored using a Quattro microtandem mass spectrometer operated in  multiple reaction monitoring mode using the following transitions: creatinine,  m/z 114>44; d3-creatinine (IS), m/z 117>47; ascomycin (IS), m/z 809>756; and CsA,  m/z 1,220>1,203.

METHODS:  We included 77 patients with HSP and 25 healthy control children. Levels of serum  creatinine, urinalysis, and 12-h proteinuria assessments were performed. Urinary  MCP-1 levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients had  nephritis (74 %).

We  hypothesized that serum creatinine alteration after HDMTX administration predicts  MTX clearance. Overall, 122 cycles in 50 patients of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or  acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged ≤18 years receiving HDMTX were enrolled  prospectively. Plasma MTX levels were measured at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and  72 hours; serum creatinine was measured at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 hours.  Correlation of plasma MTX levels with creatinine levels and changes in creatinine  from baseline (Δ creatinine) were evaluated. Plasma MTX levels at 72 hours showed  positive correlation with serum creatinine at 48 hours (P = .011) and 72 hours (P  = .013) as also Δ creatinine at 48 hours (P = .042) and 72 hours (P = .045).  However, cut-off value of either creatinine or Δ creatinine could not be  established to reliably predict delayed MTX clearance. Greater than 50% Δ  creatinine at 48 and 72 hours significantly predicted grade 3/4 leucopenia (P =  .036 and P = .001, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (P = .012 and P = .009,  respectively) but not mucositis (P = .827 and P = .910, respectively). Delayed  MTX elimination did not predict any grade 3/4 toxicity. In spite of demonstration  of significant correlation between serum creatinine and Δ creatinine with plasma  MTX levels at 72 hours, cut-off value of either variable to predict MTX delay  could not be established. Thus, either of these cannot be used as a surrogate for  plasma MTX estimation.

BACKGROUND: In  diabetic patients undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI, the incidence of CIN  is higher than in non-diabetic patients. High doses of contrast media also  increase the likelihood of renal dysfunction. The ratio of the volume of contrast  media to creatinine clearance (V/CrCl) and iodine dose-to-creatinine clearance  (I-dose/CrCl) has been shown to correlate with the area under the curve of  contrast media concentration over time and was used to predict the occurrence of  CIN in unselected patients. No study has been conducted specifically in diabetic  patients undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI before. MATERIAL AND METHOD:  We conducted a prospective, single center study. The V/CrCl and I-dose/CrCl were  calculated in diabetic patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization or  PCI. An increase in serum creatinine of > 0.5 mg/dl or > 25% by 7 days from  baseline was considered CIN. The incidence of CIN was determined. The predictive  value of V/CrCl and I-dose/CrCl for CIN were assessed using multivariable  logistic regression. RESULTS: The total number of patients that had been enrolled  in the study was 248; Male 50.8%. The overall incidence of CIN was 5.2%. The mean  age for the entire population was 65 +/- 9 years; the mean body mass index was  25.6 +/- 4.0 kg/m2; and the mean creatinine clearance was 60.6 +/- 27.4 ml/min.  The mean values of V/CrCl for patients with and without CIN were 3.7 +/- 2.9 and  2.2 +/- 1.7 (p = 0.041). The mean values of I-dose/CrCl for patients with and  without CIN were 1.31 +/- 0.94 and 0.82 +/- 0.63 (p = 0.042). The  receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis indicated that a V/CrCl ratio of  2.60 and I-dose/CrCl of 0.98 were fair predictors of CIN. After adjusting for  other known predictors of CIN, a V/CrCl ratio > or = 2.60 remained the only  significant predictor of CIN (Odds ratio 5.8; 95% confidence interval 1.7-19.4, p  = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: A V/CrCl ratio > or = 2.60 was a significant predictor of  CIN in diabetic patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization or PCI.","2010-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","S29-34","","","93 Suppl 1","","J Med Assoc Thai","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Thailand PMID: 20364554","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Prospective Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Postoperative Period; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Treatment Outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Incidence; Coronary Angiography; Creatinine/*blood; Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/*methods; Anti-Infective Agents, Local/*administration & dosage; Cardiac Catheterization/*methods; Contrast Media/*adverse effects; Diabetic Angiopathies/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy; Iodine/*administration & dosage; Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are particular  physiological situations in which tubular creatinine reabsorption has been  documented, such as in the case of healthy newborns and premature babies. We  performed a prospective study in order to evaluate if there is tubular creatinine  reabsorption in healthy elderly people. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied  prospectively nine healthy volunteers, four of them young (20-33 years old) and  the remaining five, old (65-73 years old). Since creatinine is secreted in the  proximal tubules, and its secretion can be completely blocked by cimetidine  administration, a creatinine clearance with cimetidine reliably represents the  glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, if the ratio creatinine clearance  (Ccr)/creatinine clearance with cimetidine (CcrWC) is higher than one, this would  indicate net creatinine secretion, whereas a ratio lower than one would indicate  a net renal creatinine tubular reabsorption; a ratio equal to one indicates  creatinine filtration. Finally, the Ccr, CcrWC, and Ccr/CcrWC ratios were  compared between the young and old group. STATISTICAL TESTS: Mann-Whitney and  Wilcoxon tests were used. RESULTS: As expected, creatinine clearance in the  elderly was significantly lower than in the young [Ccr: 74.4 ml/min (47.9-100.9)  (old) vs. 153.8 ml/min (108.3-199.2) (young), p = 0.014]. Similarly, the  creatinine clearance with cimetidine (CcrWC) was significantly lower in the  elderly compared to the young [CcrWC: 81.8 ml/min (69.2-94.5) (old) vs. 122.5  ml/min (82.6-162.4) (young), p = 0.028]. The ratio of Ccr/CcrWC was 0.9 in the  elderly vs. 1.26 in the young (p = 0.014), indicating net creatinine reabsorption  in the elderly and net creatinine secretion in the young. CONCLUSION: Our  findings indicate that there seems to be a net reabsorption of creatinine in the  renal tubules of healthy old persons.","2009","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","727-731","","3","41","","Int Urol Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 19115077","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Young Adult; Kidney/*metabolism; Absorption; Creatinine/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was designed to estimate renal function and the  prevalence of renal dysfunction in essential hypertensive patients, comparing SCr  and 4 formulas used to measure the creatinine clearance (CrCl) (the urinary CrCl  formula, Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD and body surface formula) The study included 721  essential hypertensive patients, 319 men (44.2%), 402 women (55.8%), mean age  56.3 +/- 13.9 (53.7 +/- 14.4 vs 58.3 +/- 13.3). In all subjects SCr was measured  and 24-h urine sample was collected to evaluate CrCl. Creatinine clereance was  calculated by 4 formulas. Patients were grouped according to age (< 40, 41-65,  65-75 and > 76) and renal function was classified as normal when SCr < 1.4 in  women and 1.5 mg/dl in men and CrCl (> 60 ml/m, respectively) within the above  written formulas. SCr increases with age (1.01 +/- 0.36 vs 1.3 +/- 1.15) and CrCl  decreases according to the 4 formulas (107.6; 92.8; 74.7 and 57.3 for the urinary  SCr formula); (117.7; 87.7; 65.9 and 49.5 for the CC formula); (87.4, 74.9, 66.5  and 61 for the MDRD formula) and (97, 85.3, 71.9 and 57.3 for the body suface  formula). The 4 formulas are comparable markers of renal function in the overall  population. With any formula the percentage of patients with impaired renal  function was much higher than indicated by the plasma creatinine alone (4% for  SCr) vs 18.3-25.3% (CrCl < 60 ml/m) according to the 4 formulas.

The aim of this study was to  examine the ability of PCR and ACR to predict urinary 24 h protein and albumin  loss, respectively, in patients with kidney disease, and determine the most  appropriate time of collection. METHODS: Eighty-three patients were recruited  from a renal outpatient clinic. In a 24 h period, each collected an early-morning  urine (EMU), second and third voids, and the remaining urine passed that day. PCR  and ACR were determined in random urines and compared with the 24 h loss of  protein and albumin, respectively. RESULTS: For all patients, median (range) 24 h  urine protein and albumin losses were 220 (30-15600) and 60 (<8-10,557) mg,  respectively. Ratios derived from each of three random urines correlated well  with 24 h protein or albumin loss (Spearman's r(s) > 0.87, P < 0.0001). Receiver  operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed PCR accurately predicted both  an abnormal 24 h urine protein > or =150 mg/24 h (areas under curves [AUC]  0.90-0.92) and significant proteinuria above 300 mg/24 h (AUC between 0.97 and  1.00). ACR accurately predicted both an abnormal 24 h urine albumin > or =30  mg/24 h (AUC 0.98 to 0.99) and frank albuminuria at > or =300 mg/24 h or > or  =700 mg/24 h (AUC between 0.99 and 1.00). EMU and random urines performed equally  well in predicting proteinuria and albuminuria from PCR and ACR, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: By careful choice of cut-offs, both PCR and ACR can be used in  patients with kidney disease to rule in or rule out abnormal 24 h losses of  protein and albumin. EMU and, importantly, random samples can be used as  surrogates for 24 h urine collections.","2009-11","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","468-476","","Pt 6","46","","Ann Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19729498","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Reproducibility of Results; Area Under Curve; Aged, 80 and over; ROC Curve; Creatinine/*urine; Albuminuria/*urine; Nephrology/methods; Chemistry, Clinical/methods; Kidney Diseases/*urine; Proteinuria/*urine; Urinalysis/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endogenous creatinine  clearance or indirect estimates of this parameter are generally recommended for  adapting drug dosage. The present study evaluates the validity of both  assumptions. METHODS: We compared pharmacokinetics (and pharmacodynamics) of 50  mg atenolol, 800 mg piracetam and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide plus 50 mg  triamterene in ten healthy young [25 (2) years] and 11 healthy elderly subjects  [68 (5) years]. Inulin (Cin) and para-aminohippurate [PAH (CPAH)] clearance  (infusion clearance technique), endogenous (C(Cr)) and calculated  (Cockroft-Gault) creatinine clearance, analysis of drugs and their metabolites  (HPLC), were performed. Renal haemodynamics and the pharmacokinetics of  beta-adrenergic blocking agent, diuretics and the nootropic agent piracetam,  respectively, were measured on separate days. RESULTS: Cin was significantly (P <  0.01) lower in the healthy elderly subjects [104 (12) vs 120 (14) ml x min(-2) x  1.73 m(-2) in the young], but remained within the normal range (> 90 ml x min(-2)  x 1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, C(Cr) was even lower in healthy elderly subjects [95  (24) vs 121 (20) ml x min(-1) in the young], and the Cockroft-Gault clearance  underestimated true glomerular filtration rate (GFR) even more seriously [74 (17)  vs 122 (16) ml min(-1)]. For atenolol the mean area under the curve (AUC) was  similar in both groups [3.16 (0.48) microg x h(-1) x ml(-1) in the elderly vs  3.01 (0.30) in the young], as was the mean maximal plasma concentration [0.42  (0.07) vs 0.44 (0.06) microg x ml(-1)], but the proportion of the drug excreted  in urine was marginally (P < 0.025) lower in the elderly. Similar results were  obtained for hydrochlorothiazide, whereas no marked differences between the  groups were found for triamterene and its metabolite. Furthermore, the  pharmacodynamic action of diuretics was not significantly altered in the elderly.  CONCLUSIONS: The true GFR of the healthy elderly remains within the normal range  and is underestimated by creatinine clearance and more so by its surrogate  (Cockroft-Gault clearance). In parallel, pharmacokinetics of renally excreted  drugs are not affected in the healthy elderly to a clinically significant extent.  For drugs with a narrow therapeutic window, indirect estimates of GFR appear to  be an unreliable means for calculating correct dosage in the elderly.","1999-05","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","205-211","","3","55","","Eur J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 10379636","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Aged; *Pharmacokinetics; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/urine; Hemodynamics; Aging/*physiology; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Kidney Function Tests; Atenolol/pharmacokinetics; Diuretics/pharmacokinetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacokinetics; Kidney/*physiology; Nootropic Agents/pharmacokinetics; Piracetam/pharmacokinetics; Triamterene/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum samples were collected every hour (48 samples per  individual) to evaluate the effect of different sampling times on the test  results. The median intra-individual coefficients of variations for the studied  markers were 4.2% for creatinine, 4.7% for eGFR(MDRD), 5.5% for cystatin C, and  7.7% for eGFR(CystC). Neither cystatin C nor creatinine differed significantly  between the night- and day-sleep conditions. Cystatin C differed significantly  with time of day (p=.0003), but this was not the case for creatinine (p=.11). The  circadian variation of cystatin C was minor. Small but significant increases in  creatinine values and a decrease of eGFR(MDRD) were observed after food intake.

Over a 2-year  period 55 patients were switched to hydromorphone therapy, and the efficacy and  outcomes were assessed. Urea and electrolyte measurements were also recorded at  the time of opioid switch and renal impairment defined as urea > 10.5 mmol/l  and/or creatinine > or = 101 mmol/l. This group of 29 patients with abnormal urea  and/or creatinine (Group 1) was compared with the remaining 26 patients (Group 2)  who had normal urea and creatinine. The major reasons for change to hydromorphone  were side-effects (cognitive/drowsiness/nausea) on previous therapy. Following a  switch to hydromorphone these side-effects improved in over 80% of patients (n =  55). Comparison between Group 1 and 2 demonstrated a significant difference in  renal function but no significant differences in reasons for change, dose of  opioids or response to change (over 80% improvement following opioid switch). We  conclude that hydromorphone is a flexible second-line alternative to morphine  that is particularly useful when intolerable side-effects are experienced with  other opioids. In renal impairment (including two patients with end-stage renal  failure) we found hydromorphone to be safe and effective. Further clinical and  pharmacokinetic studies are required.","2001-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","26-34","","1","15","","Palliat Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11212464","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Treatment Outcome; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; Kidney/physiopathology; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Creatinine/analysis; Urea/analysis; Hydromorphone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Morphine/adverse effects; Palliative Care/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

QTc prolongation is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.  The objectives of this study were to identify the role of drug-drug interactions  (DDIs) and other predictors (age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, and electrolyte  abnormalities) in life threatening QTc prolongation in patients admitted to  medical (M), surgical (S) and emergency (E) ICUs. Methods This prospective,  observational study included patients above the age of 18 years who were admitted  to SICU, EICU, and MICU at a tertiary respiratory referral center.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring was performed during the first 5 days of ICU  admission. Risk factors and DDIs which were anticipated to be associated with the  prolongation of the QTc interval were assessed for all patients. Results Two  hundred patients were included in the study. QTc prolongation occurred in 10.7%  of patients and the majority of patients presenting with QTc prolongation had  creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL during their 5 days of ICU admission. Incidence  of pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs was significantly higher in patients with QTc  prolongation vs. other patients. Creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL and PD DDIs  were associated with QTc prolongation during 5 days of ICU admission. Conclusions  High serum creatinine and PD DDIs can increase the risk of QTc prolongation in  patients admitted to the ICU. QTc interval measurements should be performed prior  to initiation or after starting any drug that is associated with QT prolongation,  specifically in patients with the known risk factors.","2019-12-18","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","/j/dmdi.2019.34.issue-4/dmpt-2019-0022/dmpt-2019-0022.xml","","4","34","","Drug Metab Pers Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 31860464","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Drug Interactions; Young Adult; Electrocardiography; *Intensive Care Units; *Long QT Syndrome; creatinine levels; Creatinine/*analysis/pharmacokinetics; critically ill patients; drug-drug interactions (DDIs); intensive care unit (ICU); QTc prolongation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During cimetidine administration the  creatinine/inulin clearance ratio approaches unity in patients with renal  failure. We determined the clearance of lithium (an index of fluid delivery to  the distal nephron), inulin (a measure of the actual GFR) and creatinine during  cimetidine administration to investigate the occurrence of tubular creatinine  secretion in patients with compensated cirrhosis. A total of 12 patients with  Child-Pugh A cirrhosis were studied initially. The subjects consumed a stable  diet containing 100 mmol of sodium. On successive days, 9 h creatinine clearances  were measured, first without and then with the oral administration of cimetidine  (400 mg as a priming dose, followed by 200 mg every 3 h). During the first study  day, 4 h renal lithium clearance was also calculated. A further group of five  patients with fully compensated cirrhosis underwent the measurement (on  successive days) of plasma inulin clearance, first without and then with the oral  administration of cimetidine (same schedule of drug administration). Cimetidine  administration unmasked a marked overestimation of GFR when calculated as  creatinine clearance (baseline, 138+/-20 ml/min; +cimetidine, 89+/-13 ml/min;  P<0.01). Consequently, during cimetidine administration the calculated lithium  fractional excretion (a measure of the fraction of filtered sodium load that is  delivered to the loop of Henle) rose from 21.4+/-13.2% to 32.3+/-18.9% (P<0.05),  and the ratio between absolute distal tubular sodium reabsorption and filtered  sodium load rose from 20.6+/-13.1% to 31.6+/-19.3% (P<0.01). Cimetidine caused no  significant decrease in the actual GFR (i.e. inulin clearance) when administered  to the second group of patients with compensated cirrhosis. Our data demonstrate  significant tubular secretion of creatinine in patients with compensated  cirrhosis and, consequently, a marked overestimation of GFR and filtered sodium  load and an underestimation of the fractional distal tubular sodium reabsorption  when these parameters are calculated by means of the traditional creatinine and  lithium clearance computation.

METHODS: Twenty-six healthy  pregnant women aged 19-30 years were studied for two sessions, first in their  third trimester of pregnancy and then in a non-pregnant state at 6-12 weeks after  delivery. In both sessions, creatinine clearance was assessed at three periods:  the 24-h baseline, and at the end of 2-h sitting and 2-h lying (in left lateral  decubitus position) periods. Urine and blood samples were collected for  creatinine clearance measurement. RESULTS: The results showed that the 24-h  creatinine clearance in late pregnancy was 28.3% higher than that in the  non-pregnant state (122.6 +/- 26.2 vs 95.3 +/- 15.1 mL/min per 1.73 m2, P <  0.001). In late pregnancy, after 2-h sitting, creatinine clearance decreased  significantly (10%) compared to the 24-h baseline (122.6 +/- 26.2 vs 110.4 +/-  28.6 mL/min per 1.73 m2, P < 0.001). Creatinine clearance rose back to the high  baseline level after the pregnant woman laid in left lateral decubitus for 2 h.  The decrease in creatinine clearance during prolonged sitting was not seen in the  non-pregnant state. At any posture, the creatinine clearance was always higher in  the pregnant state than in the non-pregnant. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that  creatinine clearance in late pregnancy was much higher than in the non-pregnant  state, and was affected by sitting for up to 2 h. It might be wise for women to  lay down in the left lateral decubitus position for a while after many hours of  sitting when pregnancy is approaching its term.","2008-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","337-342","","3","34","","J Obstet Gynaecol Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 18686345","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Pregnancy; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Posture/*physiology; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; *Gestational Age; Creatinine/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Postpartum Period/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although serum creatinine is often used to  monitor chronic changes in allograft GFR, creatinine excretion has not been  systematically investigated in renal transplant recipients. In the present study,  creatinine excretion was examined in 100 patients who survived at least 12 months  with functioning renal allografts. Overall, there was a progressive decline in  creatinine excretion from 1420 +/- 410 mg/24 hr at 3 months to 1240 +/- 394 mg/24  hr at last follow-up, 89 +/- 35 months after transplantation (mean +/- SD). The  decline in creatinine excretion was greatest in those who subsequently returned  to dialysis (-27.4 +/- 20.2%, P less than .05) compared with those who died (-6.9  +/- 24.1%), or survived with functioning allografts (-3.7 +/- 18.1%).  Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, sex, body weight, obesity, diabetes,  and cumulative average daily corticosteroid dose (factors that affect muscle  mass) all influenced creatinine excretion. However, early post-transplant  clinical parameters failed to predict patients who subsequently had declines in  creatinine excretion. Thus, it was not possible to predict patients in whom  chronic changes in allograft function would be underestimated by changes in serum  creatinine. Although clinically relevant functional alterations can be detected  by changes in serum creatinine, additional measures of GFR should be used to  complement the serum creatinine and monitor chronic changes in allograft function  after renal transplantation.","1989-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","424-428","","3","48","","Transplantation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2675399","","","","Humans; Time Factors; Body Weight; Age Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Renal Dialysis; Diabetes Complications; *Kidney Transplantation; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/metabolism/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 30 patients two 2 x 2 h and two  24-h creatinine clearances were performed on consecutive days. In addition,  creatinine clearances estimated by 4 different equations were calculated. Two by  two hour creatinine clearance provided a measurement of GFR as valid as 24-h  creatinine clearance. RESULTS: We found, that 2 x 2 h creatinine clearance was  well repeatable with a mean difference between 2 repeated measurements of 0.8  ml/min and low coefficients of repeatability of 14.5 ml/min. The validity of 2 x  2 h creatinine clearance, assessed by the mean difference between 2 x 2 and 24-h  creatinine clearances, was 1.2 ml/min with tight 95% limits of agreement with a  range from -8.1 to 10.5 ml/min. This high degree of repeatability and validity  was present over the entire range of renal function (6-141 ml/min). As 2 x 2 h  creatinine clearance is more simple and rapid than 24-h creatinine clearance,  results are obtained on the same day and easy, but repeatable and valid  day-to-day monitoring of renal function is possible. In addition, the two times  two hour clearances allow for quality control. In contrast, estimated creatinine  clearances show only poor validity. CONCLUSION: Because of the high degree of  repeatability and validity, 2 x 2 h creatinine clearance may replace 24-h  creatinine clearance as the standard method to determine renal function in  clinical practice.","1999-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","348-354","","6","51","","Clin Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 10404695","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Methods; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Models, Theoretical; Creatinine/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The study was designed as an open,  randomized two-way crossover trial. A single oral dose of 2000 mg capecitabine  was administered on two separate days to 25 patients with solid tumors. On one  day, the patients received four 500-mg tablets of formulation B (test  formulation) and on the other day, four 500-mg tablets of formulation A  (reference formulation). The washout period between the two administrations was  between 2 and 8 days. After each administration, serial blood and urine samples  were collected for up to 12 and 24 h, respectively. Unchanged capecitabine and  its metabolites were determined in plasma using LC/MS-MS and in urine by NMRS.  RESULTS: Based on the primary pharmacokinetic parameter, AUC(0-infinity) of  5'-DFUR, equivalence was concluded for the two formulations, since the 90%  confidence interval of the estimate of formulation B relative to formulation A of  97% to 107% was within the acceptance region 80% to 125%. There was no clinically  significant difference between the t(max) for the two formulations (median 2.1  versus 2.0 h). The estimate for C(max) was 111% for formulation B compared to  formulation A and the 90% confidence interval of 95% to 136% was within the  reference region 70% to 143%. Overall, these results suggest no relevant  difference between the two formulations regarding the extent to which 5'-DFUR  reached the systemic circulation and the rate at which 5'-DFUR appeared in the  systemic circulation. The overall urinary excretions were 86.0% and 86.5% of the  dose, respectively, and the proportion recovered as each metabolite was similar  for the two formulations. The majority of the dose was excreted as FBAL (61.5%  and 60.3%), all other chemical species making a minor contribution. Univariate  and multivariate regression analysis to explore the influence of age, gender,  body surface area and creatinine clearance on the log-transformed pharmacokinetic  parameters AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) of capecitabine and its metabolites  revealed no clinically significant effects. The only statistically significant  results were obtained for AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) of intact drug and for  C(max) of FBAL, which were higher in females than in males. CONCLUSION: The  bioavailability of 5'-DFUR in the systemic circulation was practically identical  after administration of the two tablet formulations. Therefore, the two  formulations can be regarded as bioequivalent. The variables investigated (age,  gender, body surface area, and creatinine clearance) had no clinically  significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine or its metabolites.","1999","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","453-460","","6","44","","Cancer Chemother Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 10550565","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Analysis of Variance; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Biotransformation; Cross-Over Studies; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Therapeutic Equivalency; Confidence Intervals; Regression Analysis; Tablets; Sex Characteristics; Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism; Body Surface Area; Creatinine/metabolism; Capecitabine; Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Fluorouracil/analogs & derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HYPOTHESIS: The use of different plasma clearance methods could  lead to different results and differences in reproducibility. ANIMALS: Twelve  healthy cats: 6 young adult cats (age 7-12 months), and 6 aged cats (age 9-12  years) were included in this study. METHODS: A cross-over design was used to  compare the plasma clearance of exogenous creatinine (PECCT), exo-iohexol  (PexICT), endo-iohexol (PenICT), and chromium-51 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (51Cr-EDTA), and to investigate reproducibility of these methods. Cats of  different ages were included to determine if differences in GFR in young adult  versus aged cats would be detected with these methods. The PECCT, PexICT, and  PenICT were performed in a combined manner.

METHODS:  All urine samples were collected from individuals who had been exposed to  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), occupationally and non-occupationally,  for at least 24 consecutive hours. Urinary creatinine and 1-OHP were determined.  1-OHP excretion rates were expressed either as a function of creatinine excretion  rate or as unadjusted values. Theoretical relationships between  creatinine-normalized excretion of metabolites and body weight-adjusted inhaled  dose were drawn for men with a constant body mass index. RESULTS: Creatinine  excretion rate paralleled 1-OHP excretion rate. The plot of creatinine excretion  rate-adjusted excretion rate of 1-OHP vs time led to smooth curves for  determination of toxicokinetic parameters. Creatinine normalization was adequate,  even for samples with a urinary creatinine concentration below 0.5 g/l or above 3  g/l. A theoretical analysis revealed that men weighing between 50 kg and 100 kg,  exposed to a constant dose of a pollutant producing a urinary metabolite excreted  by the same mechanism as creatinine, would exhibit a body weight-adjusted dose  span of 2 with an accompanying creatinine-normalized metabolite excretion span of  2.23-fold. CONCLUSION: The kinetics of creatinine excretion parallels that of  1-OHP, and a creatinine excretion rate-normalized excretion rate of 1-OHP appears  to allow for a better determination of the toxicokinetic parameters of 1-OHP  urinary excretion. At least in the case of 1-OHP, creatinine normalization seems  valid, even for very dilute or very concentrated urine samples. Finally, because  creatinine normalization not only compensates for variable diuresis but also  correlates better with the body weight-adjusted dose of the parent compound, it  should be used in biological monitoring of exposure to (PAHs) pyrene and to other  substances whose urinary biomarker excretion kinetics parallel that of  creatinine.","2004-04","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","177-185","","3","77","","Int Arch Occup Environ Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 14760537","","","","Humans; Male; Creatinine/*urine; *Occupational Exposure; Polycyclic Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; Pyrenes/*analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally,  other covariates influencing the CLva were investigated and predictivity of  monitoring of only trough levels to 24-hour area under the curve (AUC24) was  evaluated. METHODS: Routine vancomycin plasma levels were measured with a  fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of  individual patients, that is, CLva and volume of distribution, were determined  with maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation. CLva was calculated with the 3  prediction methods, which are solely based on creatinine clearance (CLcr)  estimated with Cockcroft and Gault formula and was compared with the calculated  CLva with maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation. Prediction errors were  calculated. Correlations between CLva and CLcr, creatinine, age, weight, sex, and  neutropenia were made. Furthermore, correlations between trough levels and AUC24  were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were included. Prediction errors  and absolute prediction errors of the 3 methods ranged from 28% to 80% and 39% to  83%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, CLva was significantly  associated with CLcr, creatinine, age, weight, sex, and neutropenia. Linear  correlation between AUC24 and trough levels was R(2) 0.38. CONCLUSIONS: Large  prediction errors make the CLva algorithms based on estimated plasma CLcr  unsuitable for use in patient care. Additionally, other factors, which are not  accounted for in the current algorithms, influence the CLva individually. Owing  to low association of AUC24 and trough levels, the AUC24 cannot be predicted with  through levels. For a reliable AUC24 guided vancomycin dosing, therapeutic drug  monitoring is necessary.","2016-02","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","120-126","","1","38","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26418699","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Area Under Curve; Young Adult; Algorithms; Tissue Distribution; Bayes Theorem; Aged, 80 and over; Multivariate Analysis; Drug Monitoring/*methods; Creatinine/blood/urine; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Vancomycin/*pharmacokinetics; Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlations have been established between serum creatinine (Scr) and 24-hour  urinary creatinine clearance with derivation of various formulae. We have tested  the applicability of these formulae in 34 Nigerian patients (22 males, 12  females) aged 18 to 58 years, (mean age 34.97 +/- 11.20 years) with established  chronic renal failure (CRF) mean Scr level 742.26 +/- 388.15 mol/L. 32 age and  sex matched healthy adults with serum creatinine values below 120 umol/l., served  as controls. Serum creatinine and 24 hour CrCl levels were determined on two  consecutive occasions. Creatinine clearance values were also derived from Scr  using each of the established prediction formulae: Cockcrof and Gault [1] Gates  [2] Hull et al [3]; Jelliffe [4]; and Mawer et al [5]. A relationship was sought  between measured CrCl and the predicted values (derived) using the stated  formulae.

We observed that good and  statistically significant correlations exist between measured CrCl values and  those predicated from the formulae (r ranging from 0.908 to 0.968 and r20.82 to  0.93 P = 0.000) and that a linear relationship exists in all cases. Cockcroft and  Gault formula gave the highest coefficient of determination r2 = 0.94.

All patients and normal subjects had a circadian rhythm for inulin  clearance with a maximum during daytime and a relative amplitude of 21% +/- 2%.  For creatinine clearance a rhythm was either absent or reduced in relative  amplitude (p less than 0.01). In all subjects the rate of tubular creatinine  secretion was higher at minimum of inulin clearance (night) than at maximum  (day). The fractional clearance (relative to inulin) of creatinine was also  higher during the night: normal subjects, 1.28 +/- 0.02 versus 1.10 +/- 0.02;  patients, 1.78 +/- 0.08 versus 1.45 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.005). This  demonstrates the inaccuracy of creatinine clearance as a measure of glomerular  filtration rate (GFR). By subsequent blocking of the tubular secretion of  creatinine with cimetidine in four normal subjects, creatinine clearance became  similar to inulin clearance during day and night. This confirms that high tubular  secretion of creatinine during the night counteracts the normal rhythmicity of  glomerular filtration of creatinine. As a result, plasma creatinine concentration  is nearly constant during a 24-hour period. In conclusion, tubular creatinine  secretion has a circadian rhythm with a phase opposite to the rhythm of GFR, thus  blunting or causing absence of a circadian rhythm for creatinine clearance.","1992-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","400-410","","3","120","","J Lab Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1517687","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Cimetidine/pharmacology; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Inulin/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/*metabolism; Nephrotic Syndrome/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of our study was to assess the impact of oliguria on urinary neutrophil  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and serum cystatin C (CysC) levels in  very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs) with a normal serum creatinine (Cr) level.  METHODS: Fifty-seven VLBWIs were enrolled in the study. Urinary NGAL, serum CysC  and Cr levels and urinary NGAL/Cr ratios were measured. Infants with Apgar scores  of >5 at 5 min and/or a serum Cr level of >1.5 mg/dL or those treated for patent  ductus arteriosus were excluded. In case of antibiotic treatment, blood and urine  samples were collected at ≥48 h after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment.  RESULTS: There was a significant difference in gestational age between infants  with oliguric episodes during hospitalization and those without, but not in birth  weight, perinatal or postnatal factors. Gestational age was negatively correlated  with urinary NGAL and serum CysC levels and urinary NGAL/Cr ratio (p < 0.05),  whereas postnatal age was negatively correlated with serum Cr level and urinary  NGAL/Cr ratio (p < 0.05). Of the 117 urine and blood samples collected, 25  (21.4%) were obtained from neonates with oliguric episodes. After adjusting for  gestational age and postnatal age, comparison of samples collected in infants  with and without oliguric episodes revealed significant differences in the mean  level of urinary NGAL and in the urinary NGAL/Cr ratio, but not in mean serum  CysC or serum Cr levels. The urinary NGAL level [area under the curve (AUC)  0.886, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.814-0.937] and urinary NGAL/Cr ratio (AUC  0.853, 95% CI 0.775-0.911) showed significantly greater discrimination for  oliguria than serum CysC (AUC 0.610, 95% CI: 0.515-0.699) or serum Cr (AUC 0.747,  95%CI 0.659-0.823) levels.

The subjects consisted of 87 men with mean age  42.2+/-14.2 years (+/-standard deviation, S.D.) and 13 women with mean age  42.5+/-14.4 years. Ethanol was measured in blood and urine by headspace gas  chromatography (GC) and EtG was determined in urine by liquid chromatography-mass  spectrometry (LC-MS). The mean UAC was 2.53+/-1.15g/l for first void compared  with 2.35+/-1.17g/l for second void, decreasing by 0.18+/-0.24g/l on average  (P<0.001 in paired t-test). The ratios of UAC/BAC were 1.35+/-0.25 for first void  and 1.20+/-0.16 for second void and the difference of 0.15+/-0.27 was  statistically significant (P<0.001). The UAC/BAC ratio was not correlated with  creatinine content of the urine specimens, whereas the concentration of urinary  EtG was positively correlated with creatinine (r=0.64 for first void and r=0.62  for second void). The UAC was not correlated with urinary EtG directly (r=-0.03  for first void and r=0.08 for second void) but after adjusting for the relative  dilution of the specimens (EtG/creatinine ratio) statistically significant  positive correlations were obtained (r=0.58 for first void and r=0.57 for second  void). The dilution of the urine, as reflected in creatinine content, is  important to consider when EtG measurements are interpreted. The excretion of EtG  in urine, like glucuronide conjugates of other drugs, is influenced by diuresis.  EtG represents a sensitive and specific marker of acute alcohol ingestion with  applications in clinical and forensic medicine.","2003-04-23","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","86-94","","1-2","133","","Forensic Sci Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 12742693","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Creatinine/*urine; Diuresis; Biomarkers/urine; Alcohol Drinking/blood/urine; Automobile Driving; Chromatography, Gas/methods; Ethanol/*blood/*urine; Forensic Medicine/methods; Glucuronates/*pharmacokinetics/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In June 1993, a  questionnaire was sent to 217 physicians who are members of the Society of  Uroradiology or the Society of Computed Body Tomography/Magnetic Resonance. There  were 149 respondents who completed a total of 70 questionnaires, providing a  response rate of 69% (149/217). RESULTS: The percentage of institutions that  always require a serum creatinine before administering intravenous contrast  medium for excretory urography, body computed tomography, and head computed  tomography was 13%, 20%, and 14%, respectively. In institutions where routine  serum creatinine is not required, approximately 60% request a serum creatinine in  either insulin-dependent or juvenile type 1 diabetes. The mean maximal acceptable  time between the serum creatinine value and contrast administration is 29 days.  It takes a mean of 69 minutes to get the results of a stat serum creatinine and  costs a mean of 15 dollars for the test. In patients with no risk factors, the  mean for the highest serum creatinine value at which respondents still gave  contrast was 2.1 mg/dL; in patients with risk factors, the mean was 1.9 mg/dL.  There was no correlation between the use of serum creatinine and the number of  studies performed in the institution or the type of contrast used. CONCLUSIONS:  The practice of requiring a pretest serum creatinine and its interpretation  regarding the use of contrast media are quite variable. In view of this disparity  in opinion, development and acceptance of a list of patients who are at increased  risk for contrast-induced nephropathy may be desirable.","1995-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","700-705","","12","30","","Invest Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8748182","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Infusions, Intravenous; Kidney Function Tests; *Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Creatinine/*blood; *Urography; Acute Kidney Injury/blood/*chemically induced; Contrast Media/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood/diagnostic imaging; Iodine Compounds/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, regular monitoring of plasma (P) creatinine is always part of lithium  treatment safety routines. Recently P-cystatin C-estimated glomerular filtration  rate (cystatin C-eGFR) had been launched as a preferable alternative to  P-creatinine. AIMS: To find out which of the two alternatives to prefer in the  safety routines for lithium-treated patients. MATERIAL: All 201 patients on  lithium treatment at the Department of Psychiatry in Lund, Sweden. METHODS:  During 14 months P-cystatin C was included in the safety routines besides routine  P-creatinine every 4 months. At the end of the study period, 182 patients were  eligible for analysis. With iohexol clearance as reference for GFR (performed in  111/182 patients) we calculated positive and negative predictive values (PPV,  NPV) for P-creatinine and for creatinine-eGFR and cystatin C-eGFR, obtained by  prediction equations. We also calculated the agreement between the measures of  GFR (including repeatability). RESULTS: PPV for cystatin C-eGFR (65%) was better  than for creatinine-eGFR (48%). Combining the two resulted in a PPV of 56% and  marginally increased NPV to 95%. The average of cystatin C-eGFR and  creatinine-eGFR yielded PPV 67% and NPV 92%. The agreement between  creatinine-eGFR and GFR was better than the agreement between cystatin C-eGFR and  GFR, but both were clinically unacceptable. The repeatability of P-creatinine was  acceptable for psychiatric purposes. The repeatability of cystatin C-eGFR was  inferior to that of P-creatinine. CONCLUSION: Our results do not justify  replacing P-creatinine by cystatin C-eGFR in the lithium treatment safety  routines.","2010-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","132-140","","2","74","","Clin Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 20630133","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Regression Analysis; Biomarkers/blood; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; Contrast Media/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Function Tests/*methods; Iohexol/pharmacokinetics; Cystatin C/*blood; Lithium/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most  important of these changes is the progressive decline in renal function with  aging. We sought to determine the association between calculated creatinine  clearance (CL(CR)) and grade 3 or 4 toxicities during adjuvant chemotherapy in  women > or =65 years of age with breast cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified  1405 patients > or =65 years of age who had been treated for primary invasive  breast cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between January 1998 and  December 2000. Patients were included in this analysis if they had stage I-III  breast cancer and had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were excluded if  they had a prior history of breast cancer or chemotherapy, or had no baseline  creatinine value available for review. RESULTS: The 126 patients who met our  criteria had received either cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil  (CMF) [n = 65, mean age 71, range 65-78] or an anthracycline-based regimen (n =  61, mean age 69, range 65-79). The majority of patients (97%) had a normal  creatinine. CL(CR), as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Jeliffe formulas,  decreased with increasing age (increased age associated with decreased  Cockcroft-Gault [p = 0.02]; increased age associated with decreased Jeliffe [p <  0.01]). In multivariate analysis, after controlling for age and co-morbidity, a  CL(CR) <50 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula was associated with an increased  risk of fever and neutropenia (odds ratio [OR] 3.60; 95% CI 1.00, 12.94; p =  0.05) and a CL(CR) <50 mL/min by the Jeliffe formula was associated with a trend  towards an increased risk of fever and neutropenia (OR 3.30; 95% CI 0.91, 12.33;  p = 0.07), grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (OR 2.43; 95% CI 0.90, 6.55; p =  0.08), and need for erythropoietin (OR 4.15; 95% CI 0.81, 2.99; p = 0.09). An  increase in creatinine (as a continuous variable) was associated with a trend  towards an increased risk of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (OR 5.81; 95%  CI 0.96, 35.33; p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older breast cancer  patients, a decreased CL(CR) and increased creatinine was associated with an  increased risk of fever and neutropenia or haematological toxicity.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis.  SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 6 research studies and 4 clinical populations including  5,504 participants who had GFR measured using urinary clearance of iothalamate.  MEASUREMENTS: Standardized serum creatinine values obtained by means of  calibration to the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory using frozen specimens, a  calibration panel, and/or survey results from the College of American  Pathologists. PREDICTOR: Noncalibrated serum creatinine assayed in research and  clinical laboratories compared with standardized serum creatinine. OUTCOME:  Difference between measured GFR versus GFR estimated from the Modification of  Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study and Cockcroft-Gault equations. RESULTS: For a  noncalibrated serum creatinine value of 1 mg/dL (88.4 micromol/L), standardized  serum creatinine value was 0.07 mg/dL (6.2 micromol/L) less than noncalibrated  values. In the pooled data set, for the MDRD Study equation, calibration improved  median percentage of difference between measured and estimated GFR from 9.0%  (interquartile range [IQR], 28%) to 5.8% (IQR, 28%) and improved the percentage  of estimates within 30% of measured GFR (P30) from 80% to 83%. The effect of  calibration was greater at higher levels of GFR and varied across studies. For  the Cockcroft-Gault equation, calibration worsened the median percentage of  difference from -2.0% (IQR, 38%) to -11.4% (IQR, 39%), and the P30, from 74% to  69%. LIMITATIONS: College of American Pathologist samples were used for  calibration of clinical populations; calibration factors do not account for drift  over time in the serum creatinine assay; calibration cannot account for variation  in assay performance among individuals. CONCLUSION: Calibration improves the  performance of the MDRD Study equation. After calibration, larger errors remain  for GFR estimates greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (>1 mL/s/1.73 m2).","2007-07","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","21-35","","1","50","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17591522","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Reference Standards; Cross-Sectional Studies; Quality Control; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; Iothalamic Acid/pharmacokinetics; *Mathematics; *Calibration; Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*standards; Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various concentrations of cephapirin, cefazolin,  cefamandole, cephalothin, and cefoxitin were added to serum samples. Apparent  creatinine concentrations were measured with the Beckman ASTRA, Technicon SMAC,  and DuPont ACA analyzers. Pharmacokinetic models were used to predict serum drug  concentrations as a function of time and renal function and to estimate the  magnitude of interference in varying situations. The magnitude of the  interference was proportional to the concentration of the drug in the sample and  additive with baseline concentrations of creatinine in the serum. Negligible  interferences occurred with cephapirin, cefazolin, and cefamandole. False  elevations (i.e., Crs greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/dl over baseline) were  detected with clinically achievable serum concentrations of cephalothin and  cefoxitin. For patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance greater  than 50 ml/min), this drug interaction would be negligible from 20 minutes to two  hours after drug administration, depending on the assay used. For patients with  renal failure, measurable interferences could persist for up to 16 hours after  dose administration. The critical concentrations were different for the three  procedures and both antibiotics. The degree of interference varies with the assay  procedure used, the serum concentration of the drug, and the patient's renal  function. To minimize drug interference, blood samples for serum creatinine  determinations should be drawn at the time of minimum drug concentration.","1981-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1348-1352","","9","38","","Am J Hosp Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7282720","","","","Humans; Time Factors; False Positive Reactions; Creatinine/*blood; Cefoxitin/*blood; Cephalosporins/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Routine monitoring of plasma MTX concentrations is clinically important, but  unfortunately is not always feasible. The aim of this study was to examine the  relationship between MTX elimination and renal function to identify parameters  that may be useful for predicting delayed MTX elimination in Chinese children  with ALL and NHL. A total of 105 children with ALL and NHL were included in the  study. Each patient received HDMTX (3 or 5 g/m2) over 24 hours. Plasma MTX  concentrations were measured at 24, 48, and 96 hours. Delayed elimination was  indicated by plasma MTX concentrations ≥1.0 at 48 hours or ≥0.1 μmol/L at 96  hours. Creatinine clearance rate (CCr) and serum Cr concentrations were measured  at 0, 24, and 48 hours. There were 39 patients (37.1%) with delayed MTX  elimination. For patients with delayed MTX elimination, the 24 hour plasma MTX  concentration was negatively correlated with the 24 hour CCr (P=0.019). The 48  hour plasma MTX concentration was positively correlated with 24 and 48 hour serum  Cr concentrations (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively), and negatively correlated  with the 24 and 48 CCr (both P<0.001). Both MTX concentrations and elimination  time decreased with increasing CCr (P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). Receiver  operating characteristic curves revealed that the best predictors of delayed MTX  elimination were 24 hour CCr 36 mmol/L (sensitivity: 64.7%; specificity: 77.4%)  (both P < 0.001).

DESIGN: Patient series. SETTING: The Children's Hospital of  Buffalo (NY). PATIENTS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients ranging in age from 2  to 20 years. MEASUREMENTS: The Cr-GFR was calculated by means of the formula GFR  (milliliters per minute per 1.73 m2) = kL/serum creatinine (milligrams per  deciliter), where L is body length in centimeters and k is a constant dependent  on age and sex. Plasma clearance of technetium Tc 99m-labeled DTPA was our  reference method for determination of GFR (DTPA-GFR). RESULTS: The Cr-GFR formula  identified children with impaired renal function (DTPA clearance, less than 80  mL/min per 1.73 m2) with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 93%. In  contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of elevated serum creatinine level for  this purpose were 80% and 96%, respectively. Of the children with renal  insufficiency (DTPA clearance, 40 to 79 mL/min per 1.73 m2), 91% were correctly  identified by the Cr-GFR formula. However, only 65% of these children had  elevated serum creatinine levels. Although all children with renal failure (DTPA  clearance, less than 40 mL/min per 1.73 m2) had abnormally high serum creatinine  levels, the specificity of this test was significantly lower than that of the  Cr-GFR formula (75% vs 100%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Cr-GFR formula is  superior to serum creatinine level for estimating GFR. This formula provides a  simple, reasonably accurate screening test for the presence and severity of  impaired renal function.","1992-10","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1232-1235","","10","146","","Am J Dis Child","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1415055","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Sensitivity and Specificity; Child, Preschool; Body Height; Mass Screening/methods/*standards; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; New York/epidemiology; Creatinine/*blood; Hospitals, Pediatric; Kidney Diseases/*blood/epidemiology/metabolism; Pentetic Acid/metabolism/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We examined 769 living kidney donor  candidates with 24-hour urine collections assessed as accurate by comparing  measured creatinine excretion rate (CER) to CER estimated using a 4-variable  equation previously developed and validated using robust methodology. RESULTS: Of  all collections, 42.6% would have been deemed inaccurate, mostly  under-collections, using the conventional weight- and gender-based CER  estimation. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) overestimated I-iothalamate GFR (iGFR),  estimated GFR (eGFR), underestimated iGFR, and their average [Avg (CrCl and  eGFR)] essentially eliminated the GFR bias (median bias = +2.2, -5.4, and -1.0  mL/min/1.73 m, respectively; P < 0.001). This held true for all subgroups except  blacks, where all 3 measures overestimated iGFR. Avg (CrCl and eGFR) also offered  modestly improved accuracy compared with CrCl alone, as measured by the  proportion of values falling within 10% (50.7% versus 45.3%; P = 0.009) and 30%  of iGFR (94.5% versus 89.3%; P < 0.001).

The effect of time delay on eGFR was further investigated  by measuring creatinine on duplicate patient samples arriving in the laboratory  after immediate and delayed centrifugation. RESULTS: A significant increase in  creatinine was seen by 24 h using kinetic Jaffe methods (P<0.025). Over a period  of 31 h creatinine concentration was stable using enzymatic creatinine assays.  Using duplicate patient samples, four of 21 patients where specimens were delayed  in the laboratory by more than 10 h showed a misclassification of CKD.

In 25 ambulatory, depressed elderly outpatients  treated with therapeutic doses of nortriptyline, relationships among plasma  levels of nortriptyline and E-10-hydroxynortriptyline, and an estimate of  creatinine clearance were examined. Plasma levels of E-10-hydroxynortriptyline  (corrected for varying dosage) were significantly correlated with age and  inversely correlated (r = -0.50) with creatinine clearance but not with  notriptyline or Z-10-hydroxynortriptyline concentration.

These results corroborate and extend previous  findings in elderly inpatients in whom creatinine clearance was measured  directly. In addition, age had an effect on E-10-hydroxynortriptyline  independently of creatinine clearance.

Traditionally,  this function is assessed by serum creatinine concentration (SeCreat). However,  SeCreat is also influenced by age, gender and body weight. Hence, creatinine  clearance (C(Cr)) is considered to be a better reflection of renal function. This  study was undertaken to explore the prognostic value of preoperative calculated  Cc, compared to SeCreat for the prediction of postoperative mortality. PATIENTS  AND METHODS: The study group comprised 852 consecutive patients who underwent  elective major vascular surgery at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam.  Preoperative C(Cr) was calculated based on the Cockroft-Gault equation using  preoperative SeCreat, age, body weight and gender. Univariable logistic  regression analyses were used to study the relation between preoperative SeCreat,  C(Cr) and postoperative mortality. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression  analysis was applied to evaluate the additional predictive value of age, body  weight and gender additional to SeCreat. The receiver operating characteristic  (ROC) curve was determined to evaluate the predictive power of several regression  models for perioperative mortality. RESULTS: Postoperative mortality was 5.9%  (50/852) within 30 days of surgery. In a univariable analysis, 10 micromol/l  increment of SeCreat were associated with a 20% increased risk of postoperative  mortality (OR = 1.2, 95% CI, 1.1-1.3) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.64  (95% CI, 0.56-0.71). If age, gender and body weight were added, the area under  the ROC curve increased to 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63-0.77; p < 0.001), indicating that  these risk factors had additional prognostic value. Indeed, in a separate  regression analysis 10 ml/min decrease in C(Cr) was associated with a 40%  increased risk of postoperative mortality (OR = 1.4,95% CI, 1.2-1.5; ROC area:  0.70, 95% CI, 0.63-0.76). ROC curve analysis showed that the cut-off value of 64  ml/min for C(Cr) yielded the highest sensitivity/specificity to predict  postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION: Preoperative SeCreat was strongly associated  with postoperative mortality, and adding age, gender, and body weight to the  model showed improved predictive power indicating that preoperative C(Cr)  calculated with these data has additional prognostic value.","2003-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","17-23","","1","59","","Clin Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 12572926","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Preoperative Care; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Aged, 80 and over; Sensitivity and Specificity; Retrospective Studies; *Postoperative Complications; Creatinine/*blood/*pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/*blood/mortality/*surgery; Vascular Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects/*mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urinary clusterin is  a biomarker of kidney injury but its utility for prediction of graft dysfunction  is unknown. METHODS: In a single-center, prospective cohort study of renal  transplant recipients (N=81), urinary clusterin was measured serially between 4  hr and 7 days after transplantation. The utility of clusterin for prediction of  DGF (hemodialysis within 7 days of transplantation) was compared with urinary  interleukin (IL)-18, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney  injury molecule-1, serum creatinine, and clinical variables. RESULTS: At 4 hr  after reperfusion, anuria was highly specific, but of low sensitivity for  detection of DGF. At 4 hr, receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested  that urinary clusterin, IL-18, kidney injury molecule-1, and NGAL concentration  were predictive of DGF. After adjusting for preoperative clinical variables and  anuria, clusterin and IL-18 independently enhanced the clinical model for  prediction of DGF. Kidney injury molecule-1 only modestly improved the prediction  of DGF, whereas NGAL, serum creatinine, and the creatinine reduction ratio did  not improve on the clinical model. At 12 hr, the creatinine reduction ratio  independently predicted DGF. CONCLUSION: Both urinary clusterin and IL-18 are  useful biomarkers and may allow triaging of patients with DGF within 4 hr of  transplantation. Relative performance of biomarkers for prediction of graft  function is time-dependant. Early and frequent measurements of serum creatinine  and calculation of the creatinine reduction ratio also predict DGF within 12 hr  of reperfusion.","2015-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","171-179","","1","99","","Transplantation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25083615","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; Area Under Curve; Renal Dialysis; ROC Curve; Biomarkers/blood/urine; Early Diagnosis; Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects; Creatinine/*urine; Lipocalin-2; Acute-Phase Proteins/urine; Lipocalins/urine; Clusterin/*blood; Delayed Graft Function/*blood/diagnosis/etiology/therapy/*urine; Interleukin-18/urine; New South Wales; Proto-Oncogene Proteins/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These produce creatinine values that are more comparable with those  obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography. However, this results in an  underestimation of measured creatinine at concentrations below 155 micromol/L and  an overestimation at concentrations above this value. METHODS: Serum and urine  creatinine concentrations were prospectively determined on samples from 60  patients using the new (compensated) and old (uncompensated) c-fas calibrators,  and Passing-Bablok regression analysis was performed. The regression equations  thus determined were then used retrospectively to determine the compensated  creatinine results (i.e. those results that would have been obtained using the  new calibrator) in those serum and urine samples analysed in the previous year  using the old uncompensated c-fas calibrator. The compensated creatinine results  were then used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating  creatinine clearance. This was done by using the formula: UV/Pt, in which U  represents the urinary creatinine concentration (micromol/L), V the urinary  collection volume (mL), P the serum creatinine concentration (micromol/L) and t  the urinary collection time (min). It was also calculated using the abbreviated  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study group (MDRD) formula. RESULTS: The  creatinine clearance as determined using either the UV/Pt calculation or the MDRD  formula overestimated GFR by approximately 30% and approximately 50%,  respectively, in normal individuals with a serum creatinine concentration below  155 micromol/L. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal failure (serum  creatinine from 155 to 500 micromol/L), changes in creatinine clearances  determined by the two procedures were minimal. CONCLUSION: When laboratories  introduce this new, compensated calibrator into practice, it may be appropriate  to discuss its potential impact with clinical staff who monitor patients using  creatinine clearance.","2004-11","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","482-484","","Pt 6","41","","Ann Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15588439","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Prospective Studies; Reference Standards; Aged, 80 and over; Calibration; Child; Child, Preschool; Retrospective Studies; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Metabolic Clearance Rate; Creatinine/*blood/*urine; Kidney Diseases/*blood/*urine; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated how outcome  metrics and baseline creatinine affect trial outcome. DESIGN, SETTING,  PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model of  creatinine change resulting from a decrease in GFR was applied to a population of  10,000 simulated virtual inpatients. Treatment was simulated as an amelioration  of GFR decrease by a specified percentage, the treatment efficacy, in 50%. Three  categorical and two continuous outcome metrics were calculated and compared.  Outcomes were compared for measured and estimated baseline creatinine levels that  were back-calculated assuming a GFR of 100 or 75 ml/min. RESULTS: The continuous  metrics, the average value of creatinine and the average value of creatinine  relative to baseline decreased approximately linearly with increase in treatment  efficacy. The categorical metrics displayed a sigmoidal decrease and erroneously  suggested perfect treatment when GFR decrease was ameliorated by only 60 to 80%.  Using an estimate of baseline creatinine increased the number of patients who  were classified as having AKI. CONCLUSIONS: When used to determine clinical trial  outcome, continuous metrics correctly detected the extent of intervention. At low  treatment efficacy, categorical metrics underestimated and at high treatment  efficacy overestimated the effect of treatment. These effects were exaggerated  when the population contained a high proportion of patients with more severe AKI.  An estimated baseline creatinine level will overestimate AKI prevalence compared  with a measured baseline value. Clinical trials of AKI should use a continuous  outcome metric and a measured baseline and report baseline median and  interquartile range.","2009-11","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1705-1715","","11","4","","Clin J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19729431  PMCID: PMC2774954","","","","Humans; Treatment Outcome; *Models, Biological; Severity of Illness Index; Drug Monitoring/*methods; Creatinine/*blood; *Computer Simulation; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; *Acute Kidney Injury/drug therapy/metabolism/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using standard continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis  technique, it is often difficult to achieve the suggested targets in anuric  patients with large body mass. Thus, the use of automated peritoneal dialysis  (APD) has been increasingly utilized to achieve adequate clearances. Automated  dialysis is usually performed at night over an 8- to 10-hour period. The role of  increases in dialysate volume and frequency of exchanges during this time period  to achieve these target K/DOQI recommendations remains uncertain. We decided to  study the effects of increasing the volume and number of exchanges in a fixed  period of time in CPD patients. METHODS: In the New Haven CAPD unit, 29 patients  maintained on APD were considered eligible for the study and 11 agreed to  participate. The patients were characterized according to standard peritoneal  equilibration test criteria. The patients were placed into two groups: group 1  included high (H) and high-average (HA), and group 2 low-average (LA)  transporters. The patients were dialyzed at night for 9 hours with standard  cycling technique, using 2.5% Dianeal (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois,  USA) solution, with a cycle volume of 2,500 mL, and a 2,000-mL daytime dwell.  Three studies were done on each patient using a total dialysis volume of 9.5 L (3  cycles), 14.5 L (5 cycles), and 19.5 L (7 cycles). Daily Kpt/V(urea) and daily  CCp (peritoneal) (L/day/1.73 m2) were obtained. RESULTS: Six patients were H or  HA (group 1) and 5 were LA transporters (group 2). For the group 1 patients, mean  weight was 86.6 +/- 13.5 kg; Kpt/V(urea) was 1.68 +/- 0.21 using 9.5 L, 2.03 +/-  0.28 for 14.5 L (p < 0.05 compared to 10 L), and 2.28 +/- 0.28 with 19.5 L (p <  0.05 compared to 10 L and 15 L); mean weekly CCp was 45.43 +/- 7.63 L/1.73 m2 for  9.5 L (p < 0.05 compared to 14.5 L and 19.5 L), 51.17 +/- 7.07 with 14.5 L, and  54.67 +/- 10.08 for 19.5 L; ultrafiltration rates were not different in the three  studies. For the group 2 patients, mean weight was 74.3 +/- 17.7 kg; mean weekly  Kpt/V(urea) was 1.68 +/- 0.35 using 9.5 L, 2.10 +/- 0.42 for 14.5 L (p < 0.05  compared to 9.5 L), and 2.31 +/- 0.56 for 19.5 L (p < 0.05 compared to 9.5 L and  14.5 L); mean weekly CCp was 42.56 +/- 10.64 L/1.73 m2 for 9.5 L (p < 0.05  compared to 14.5 L and 19.5 L), 50.89 +/- 12.66 for 14.5 L, and 51.94 +/- 11.20  for 19.5 L; ultrafiltration was lower in the 9.5-L study than in the 14.5-L and  19.5-L studies, but was not different in the 14.5-L and 19.5-L studies.  CONCLUSIONS: In both H/HA and LA transporters, Kpt/V(urea) and CCp rise  significantly when the frequency of exchanges and total volume of dialysate are  increased. Thus, the use of larger volumes of dialysate with cycling peritoneal  dialysis may result in increased clearances of urea and creatinine.","2002-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","693-697","","6","22","","Perit Dial Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12556071","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Metabolic Clearance Rate/*physiology; Urea/metabolism; Creatinine/*metabolism; Dialysis Solutions/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Kidney Diseases/*physiopathology/*therapy; Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cystatin-C is a candidate surrogate marker, allegedly  superior to serum creatinine, for estimating glomerular filtration rate, due to  its high correlation with absolute measurement of the latter. The aim of this  study was to assess from intra- and inter-subject variability the performance of  cystatin-C in a cohort of diabetic patients spanning a wide range of kidney  function and to compare it to that of serum creatinine. RESEARCH DESIGN AND  METHODS: 98 consecutive diabetic in-patients (45 type 1 and 53 type 2) were  included. Mean age was 53 +/- 15 years (1SD). Creatinine clearance was 98 ml/min  (median; range: 16-244). We used the discriminant ratio (DR) methodology to  compare the performance of serum cystatin-C vs. that of creatinine to segregate  subjects according to their glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: Serum creatinine  values on day 1 and 2 were 1.10 +/- 0.76 and 1.07 +/- 0.89 mg/dl and  concentrations of cystatin-C were 1.10 +/- 0.60 and 1.06 +/- 0.63 mg/L. A close  linear relationship was observed between means of duplicates for creatinine and  cystatin-C (Pearson product-moment correlation 0.92). DR was obtained from the  ratio of the underlying between-subject to the within-subject standard  deviations. DR values were 5.23 for creatinine and 8.82 for cystatin-C  (P<0.0001), implying superior discriminating ability for cystatin-C. Once  adjusted for attenuation, measured Pearson product-moment correlation rose from  0.92 to 0.97. The DR methodology allowed for deriving an unbiased linear  regression equation between methods, with slope and intercept at 0.79 and 0.23,  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Serum cystatin-C better discriminates among a  population of type 1 and 2 diabetic patients with regard to their estimated  glomerular filtration rate when compared with conventional serum creatinine  measurement.","2003-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","377-383","","4 Pt 1","29","","Diabetes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 14526265","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Smoking; Regression Analysis; Body Mass Index; Blood Pressure; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/physiopathology; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; Cystatin C; Glycated Hemoglobin/analysis; Cystatins/*blood; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*blood/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, healthy persons were not included in the development of  the MDRD equation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of the MDRD equation in  patients with chronic kidney disease compared with healthy persons and to develop  a new equation that uses both patients with chronic kidney disease and healthy  persons. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, a tertiary-care  medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (n = 320) who had an  iothalamate clearance test specifically for chronic kidney disease evaluation and  consecutive healthy persons (n = 580) who had an iothalamate clearance test  specifically for kidney donor evaluation. MEASUREMENTS: Serum creatinine levels,  GFR, demographic characteristics, and clinical characteristics were abstracted  from the medical record. RESULTS: The MDRD equation underestimated GFR by 6.2% in  patients with chronic kidney disease and by 29% in healthy persons. Re-estimated  coefficients for serum creatinine and sex were similar to the original MDRD  equation in the chronic kidney disease series but not in the healthy series. At  the same serum creatinine level, age, and sex, GFR was on average 26% higher in  healthy persons than in patients with chronic kidney disease (P < 0.001). A  quadratic GFR equation was developed to estimate logarithmic GFR from the  following covariates: 1/SCr, 1/SCr2, age, and sex (where SCr = serum creatinine).  LIMITATIONS: The new equation was not developed in a general population sample.  Elderly and African-American persons were underrepresented. CONCLUSION: The MDRD  equation systematically underestimates GFR in healthy persons. A new equation  developed with patients who have chronic kidney disease and healthy persons may  be a step toward accurately estimating GFR when the diagnosis of chronic kidney  disease is unknown.","2004-12-21","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","929-937","","12","141","","Ann Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15611490","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Cross-Sectional Studies; Chronic Disease; Contrast Media; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; Iothalamic Acid/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/blood/*diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate whether the elevation of SCr can be  quantitatively explained using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)  model incorporating inhibition by trimethoprim on tubular secretion of creatinine  via renal transporters such as organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), OCT3,  multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), and MATE2-K. Firstly,  pharmacokinetic parameters in the PBPK model of trimethoprim were determined to  reproduce the blood concentration profile after a single intravenous and oral  administration of trimethoprim in healthy subjects. The model was verified with  datasets of both cumulative urinary excretions after a single administration and  the blood concentration profile after repeated oral administration. The  pharmacokinetic model of creatinine consisted of the creatinine synthesis rate,  distribution volume, and creatinine clearance (CL(cre)), including tubular  secretion via each transporter. When combining the models for trimethoprim and  creatinine, the predicted increments in SCr from baseline were 29.0%, 39.5%, and  25.8% at trimethoprim dosages of 5 mg/kg (b.i.d.), 5 mg/kg (q.i.d.), and 200 mg  (b.i.d.), respectively, which were comparable with the observed values.

Urine was collected at blocked intervals from 0-2, 2-8, and 8-24 hours  and then added together to determine the 8- and 24-hour clearances. The mean  8-hour creatinine clearance was not significantly different from the 24-hour  value, whereas the mean 2-hour creatinine clearance was significantly different.

G.","Creatinine is the best molecule to target adequacy of peritoneal dialysis.","Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis","","0896-8608","","","The overall conclusion is that neither creatinine clearance nor urea clearance is the perfect index for predicting outcome in PD patients. In the absence of  indices that are better validated and more convenient, creatinine and urea are  what we have to use. They are best seen as two imperfect, but potentially  complementary, measurements. On balance, creatinine clearance is the better of  the two indices, in that it gives greater weight to residual renal function, and  residual renal function is probably a stronger predictor of patient outcome than  peritoneal clearance per se. However, creatinine clearance has a particular  weakness in low transporters; values have to be interpreted with discretion in  this group. Furthermore, both indices are flawed because of the manner in which  they are conventionally normalized. Research into more appropriate methods of  normalization, or into whether normalization is required at all, would be  helpful. The complex relationship between these clearance indices, protein  intake, and lean body mass also needs to be kept in mind. While this paper argues  in favour of creatinine clearance as the better index, it still suggests that  both indices be used, together with a large measure of clinical judgment.","2000","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","S65-69","","","20 Suppl 2","","Perit Dial Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10911646","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics; Urea/pharmacokinetics; Peritoneal Dialysis/methods/*standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and  measurement of the plasma clearance of iohexol were used to measure lean tissue  mass and GFR, respectively. Serum creatinine was significantly correlated to lean  tissue mass (r=0.65; p < 0.0001) but not to GFR (1/creatinine vs. GFR: r=0.11;  p=0.106). In contrast, serum cystatin C correlated with GFR (1/cystatin C vs.  GFR: r=0.32; p=0.0387), especially in men (1/cystatin C vs. GFR: r=0.64;  p=0.0055), but not to lean tissue mass. These results might explain previous  observations that serum cystatin C seems to be a better marker for GFR than serum  creatinine, particularly for individuals with small to moderate decreases in GFR.  However, the results also show that the serum concentrations of both creatinine  and cystatin C are determined not only by GFR, but also by other factors. Since  these additional factors differ for cystatin C and creatinine, it seems justified  to use serum creatinine and cystatin C in conjunction to estimate GFR, at least  until it is known in what situations serum creatinine or cystatin C is the  preferable marker.","1999-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","587-592","","8","59","","Scand J Clin Lab Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10691049","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Regression Analysis; Biomarkers/blood; Absorptiometry, Photon; *Body Constitution; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; Cystatin C; Iohexol/pharmacokinetics; Cystatins/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  compared the pharmacokinetics of two fourth-generation cephalosporins, cefepime  and cefpirome, and examined the relationship of drug clearance (CL) to creatinine  clearance (CL(CR)). Two separate but similar pharmacokinetic studies (which used  2 g twice daily for each antibiotic) were conducted. Blood was sampled after an  initial and a subsequent antibiotic dose. Drug plasma concentrations were  measured, and pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted and compared. The  pharmacokinetics of cefepime and cefpirome are similar in IC patients. Any  differences in drug CL can largely be attributed to differences in CL(CR).  Despite normal plasma creatinine concentrations, 54% of patients' antibiotic  concentrations were less than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (4 mg/L)  for >20% of the dosing interval. Thirty-four percent of patients had CL(CR) >144  mL/min (20% higher than the expected maximum of 120 mL/min). Only CL(CR) was an  independent predictor of antibiotic CL. Time above MIC was predicted only by  CL(CR). Some IC patients have a very large CL(CR), which results in very low  levels of studied antibiotics. Either shortening the dosage interval or using  continuous infusions would prevent low levels and keep troughs above the MIC for  longer periods. In view of the lack of bedside measurement of cephalosporin  levels, we suggest that more frequent use be made of CL(CR) to allow prediction  of small concentrations clinically. IMPLICATIONS: Some intensive care patients  have very large creatinine clearances that result in very low levels of  fourth-generation cephalosporins. Serum levels of these antibiotics need to be  maintained (time > minimum inhibitory concentration is important). Because  routine measurements of cephalosporin levels are generally unavailable, we  suggest that more frequent use be made of creatinine clearances to allow  prediction of low levels and, hence, alterations in dosing.","2003-10","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1149-1154","","4","97","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14500173","","","","Humans; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Infusions, Intravenous; Creatinine/*blood; Cephalosporins/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Critical Care; Cefepime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum creatinine  concentration is the most common indicator of renal clearance, since the most  accurate indicator, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is not easily measured.  Using equations developed over the last decades, creatinine clearance (CL(Cr)) is  readily estimated taking into account patients' biological sex, age, body  composition, and sometimes race. In this work, differences in estimated CL(Cr)  between different equations were studied and the influence of some patients'  characteristics evaluated. Data collected from 82 inpatients receiving antibiotic  therapy was analyzed and CL(Cr) was estimated using a total of 12 equations.  Patients were stratified according to their sex, age, and body composition to  shed some light on the impact of these parameters in the estimations of renal  function. More variability between estimation methods was highlighted (a) in  patients between 51 and 60 years old, (b) within the normal body mass index  group, and (c) in patients with serum creatinine levels below normal criteria.

Therefore, we established a cystatin  C-based model of vancomycin. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to  externally verify the PopPK model of vancomycin based on the glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) estimated by serum cystatin C in our previous study and to  compare the prediction performance of cystatin C (Cys C) and serum creatinine  (SCR)-based models. METHODS: The external data set consists of adults receiving  vancomycin treatment at The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical  University. We summarized and restored published models based on serum creatinine  values from the literature and used our external data set for initial screening.  Visual and external verifications were used to further select candidate models  for comparison. The mean prediction error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE) and  root mean squared error (RMSE) were the primary outcomes for the overall  comparison. Group comparisons of patients with different glomerular filtration  rates (GFRs), ages and body mass index (BMI) levels were obtained by the Bayesian  method. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients with 233 samples were collected as an  external data set. Sixteen published models were summarized and restored. After  screening, four candidate models suitable for the external data set were finally  obtained for comparison. The cystatin C-based model has a smaller ME value in the  overall comparison. In the group comparison, serum creatinine-based models were  underestimated in the prediction for patient groups with age ≥ 60 years, abnormal  BMI values and GFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2), for which the cystatin C-based model  could solve this problem. CONCLUSION: After comparison, we suggest that cystatin  C is a superior renal function marker to serum creatinine for vancomycin PopPK  models.","2020-02","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","135-149","","1","45","","Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 31541402","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Metabolic Clearance Rate; China; Biomarkers/*blood; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Drug Monitoring/*methods; Kidney/physiology; Creatinine/*blood; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Cystatin C/*blood; Vancomycin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The patients were randomly divided into a modeling group  (n = 126) and a validation group (n = 50). The first-order absorption  one-compartment model was used to develop a population pharmacokinetic model from  a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach. Sixteen single nucleotide  polymorphisms involved in the pharmacokinetic variables of digoxin were  identified by using the MassARRAY system.

The major objectives of this study were to compare  plasma exogenous creatinine clearance (PECC) with a reference method, to  establish reference intervals (RIs) for PECC and to assess the effects of  indexation of GFR to bodyweight (BW) in cats. PECC was compared with urinary  clearance of exogenous creatinine (UECC) in six clinically healthy domestic  shorthair cats (experiment 1). Tentative RIs were determined according to current  guidelines and the effects of indexation to BW and of covariables on GFR were  assessed in 43 clinically healthy cats of various breeds (experiment 2). PECC was  15% higher than UECC (P <0.01), but the two estimates were strongly correlated  (r(2)=0.97, P = 0.001). RIs for PECC were 6.4-21.3 mL/min or 1.2-4.9 mL/min/kg.  The absolute (i.e. non-indexed) GFR value was not dependent on BW. Thus,  indexation of GFR to BW in cats would not standardize the GFR value, but could  introduce bias in clinical interpretation. Significant effects of breed, plasma  protein concentration and plasma albumin concentration on GFR were demonstrated.  Plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine, when assessed separately, were also  weakly correlated with GFR in healthy cats. These combined findings contribute to  a better understanding of renal function assessment in cats.","2014-10","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","157-165","","1","202","","Vet J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Urines (n = 140) from 51 patients with  surveillance or indication biopsies were assayed for urinary CXCL10 using  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and corrected with urinary creatinine. RESULTS:  Median urinary CXCL10-to-creatinine (Cr) ratio (ng/mmol) was significantly  elevated in subclinical TCMR (4.4 [2.6, 25.4], P < 0.001, n = 17); clinical TCMR  (24.3 [11.2, 44.8], P < 0.001, n = 9); and antibody-mediated rejection (6.0 [3.3,  13.7], P = 0.002, n = 9) compared to noninflamed histology (1.4 [0.4, 4.2],  normal and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, n = 52), and borderline  tubulitis (3.3, [1.3, 4.9], n = 36). Elevated urinary CXCL10:Cr was independently  associated with t scores (P < 0.001) and g scores (P = 0.006) on multivariate  analysis. The area under receiver operating curve for subclinical and clinical  TCMR was 0.81 (P = 0.045) and 0.88 (P = 0.019), respectively. This corresponded  to a sensitivity-specificity of 0.59-0.67 and 0.77-0.60 for subclinical and  clinical TCMR at cutoffs of 4.82 and 4.72 ng/mmol, respectively.

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. PATIENTS:  Thirteen patients with lupus nephritis with mild renal insufficiency (mean serum  creatinine, 230 mumol/L [2.6 mg/dL]; median, 106 mumol/L [1.2 mg/dL]).  INTERVENTIONS: Patients were given placebo or cimetidine tablets, 400 mg four  times daily for 2 days, with ambulatory 24-hour urine collection during the  second 24 hours (""outpatient study""). Simultaneous 4-hour  technetium-99-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Tc99-DTPA) and CCrs were  measured immediately after each 24-hour collection (""simultaneous study"").  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Use of cimetidine improved the accuracy of CCr, as  measured by the CDTPA-to-CCr ratio (1.07 [cimetidine] compared with 1.33  [placebo]; P less than 0.05). Cimetidine use also improved the precision of CCr  (P less than 0.05). In addition, when compared with standard clinical estimators  of GFR, creatinine clearance with cimetidine rendered the most precise estimates  of GFR and explained more of the variation in GFR estimation than did any other  method (R2 = 0.78 compared with R2 = 0.52 to 0.63). These effects were shown  under both simultaneous and outpatient conditions. No side effects due to  cimetidine occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lupus nephritis, the  cimetidine-aided CCr offers a compromise between the precise and accurate but  expensive and inconvenient research techniques (inulin, iothalamate, or DTPA  clearances) and the grossly inaccurate and imprecise but convenient technique  (CCr) for determining GFR.","1990-10-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","501-506","","7","113","","Ann Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2393206","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Double-Blind Method; Reproducibility of Results; Random Allocation; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Confidence Intervals; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects; Creatinine/*metabolism; *Cimetidine; Lupus Nephritis/*metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The estimated  glomerular filtration is derived from mathematical models using serum creatinine,  a measurement that suffers interference of some drugs, such as metamizole. This  study intended to evaluate the impact on patient stratification for dose  adjustment of two antimicrobials (meropenem and vancomycin) caused by metamizole  interference in creatinine measurement by dry chemistry. METHODS: A  cross-sectional study was conducted with a group of 108 hospitalized patients  under metamizole prescriptions at fixed intervals. Serum creatinine  concentrations were determined by enzymatic dry chemistry and Jaffé assays, and  the estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated through the CKD-EPI  equation. Patients were stratified in groups according to their estimated  glomerular filtration rate for drug dosing of vancomycin and meropenem. RESULTS:  Creatinine values were significantly lower in measurements performed by the dry  chemistry method in comparison to Jaffé assay (P < 0.0001) when patients are  under metamizole treatment. A significant bias (-40.3%) was observed between  those two methods, leading to a significant difference (P < 0.0001) in patient  classification according to renal function using the CKD-EPI equation for dosing  adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: During the validity of metamizole treatment, the  stratification for drug dosing by the estimated glomerular filtration rate is not  reliable if the creatinine measurement is done through dry chemistry. Clinical  and laboratory staff must be aware of these limitations and cooperate to optimize  pharmacotherapy.","2021-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","474-480","","5","58","","Ann Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 34006123","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Creatinine; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; *Dipyrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; enzymatic methods; Meropenem/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; renal disease; Vancomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: We determined the  proportional contribution of nitromethane in blood samples to creatinine measured  by the Jaffé colorimetric and the point-of-care (POC) reactions and determined  whether the difference can reliably estimate the concentration of nitromethane.  Additionally, we determined whether the presence of nitromethane interferes with  anion/osmolal gaps and ascertained the stability of nitromethane in serum after 7  days. METHODS: Nitromethane was added to whole blood from four healthy volunteers  to achieve concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mmol/L. The following tests  were performed: creatinine (Jaffé and POC), electrolytes (associated with Jaffé  and POC), osmolality and nitromethane concentration (gas chromatography [GC]).  Remaining samples were refrigerated and reanalyzed using GC at 7 days. Anion and  osmolal gaps were calculated. Proportional recovery and degradation of  nitromethane were measured using GC. Data were analyzed for agreement with  single-factor ANOVA (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Mean creatinine for POC and Jaff methods  were 0.93 vs. 0.76 mg/dL, respectively. Jaff creatinine concentrations increased  linearly with increasing nitromethane concentrations (R(2) = 1, p = 0.01):  measured creatinine (mg/dL) = 7.1*nitromethane (mmol/L) = 0.79. POC creatinine  remained unchanged across the range of nitromethane concentrations (p = 0.99).  Anion and osmolal gaps also remained unchanged. Nitromethane was reliably  identified in all sample concentrations using GC on Day 0. Detection of 0.25  mmol/L nitromethane was not consistently recovered on Day 7. Nitromethane  degradation was most pronounced at 2 mmol/L concentrations (81% recovery).  CONCLUSIONS: Nitromethane alters apparent concentration of creatinine using the  Jaffé reaction in a linear fashion but not when using the POC reaction. Measured  difference between Jaffé and POC creatinine may identify the presence and  estimate concentration of nitromethane. Presence of nitromethane did not alter  the anion or osmolal gap; thus it would not potentially interfere with the  diagnosis of co-exposure to a toxic alcohol.","2014-07","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","611-617","","6","52","","Clin Toxicol (Phila)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24844579","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Kidney; Young Adult; Metabolic; Chromatography, Gas; *Point-of-Care Systems; Creatinine/*blood; Colorimetry; *Acid-Base Equilibrium/drug effects; *Osmolar Concentration; Methane/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Nitroparaffins/*blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; other","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study ais to compare the GFR estimated by MDRD  formula and that calculated by the average of creatinine and urea clearances in  unselected patients with advanced renal failure. The study group consisted of 320  (163 males) with advanced renal failure not yet on dialysis. Their mean age was  63 +/- 14 years. Diabetic nephropathy was the most common etiology of renal  failure (25%). Significant comorbidity was observed in 115 patients. Serum  creatinine (Cr), urea and albumin were determined in all patients. Creatinine  (Ccr) and urea clearance (Cu) were calculated on a 24-hour urine collection. The  GFR was estimated by summing Ccr and Cu, and dividing by two (Ccr-Cu). THe  clearances were corrected for a body surface area of 1.73 m2. The MDRD formula  for the estimation of GFR included the following parameters: serum Cr, BUN, age,  gender and serum albumin. Linear regression analysis and Bland-Altmann plot were  utilized to establish the degree of correlation and agreement between both  estimations of GFR. The percent differences between the two estimations of GFR  was especially analyzed in those subgroups of patients which were not included in  the MDRD study (patients older than 70 years, diabetics and those with comorbid  conditions). The mean GFR estimated by Ccr-Cu and by MDRD formula were 10.04 +/-  3.10 ml/min and 10.55 +/- 3.60 ml/min, respectively (p < 0.0001). The two  parameters correlated significantly (R = 0.76, p < 0.0001). GFR by the MDRD  formula tended to overestimate the highest values of Ccr-Cu. The mean percent  difference between both methods was 6.5 +/- 23.6. MDRD predictive equation  overestimated significantly Ccr-Cu in patients older than 70 years (mean  overestimation of 15%), males (10%), diabetics (10%), and mainly in patients with  comorbidity (17%). In conclusion, the GFR estimated by MDRD formula is very  similar to Ccr-Cu in young uremic patients without comorbidity. However, major  discrepancies between these two methods could be observed in older patients, and  mainly in those with comorbidity.","2002","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","432-437","","5","22","","Nefrologia","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 12497744","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Linear Models; *Algorithms; Comorbidity; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Uremia/metabolism; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism; *Metabolic Clearance Rate; Creatinine/*metabolism; Urea/*metabolism; Diabetic Nephropathies/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design We enrolled 67 patients with  uncomplicated essential hypertension (EH) during stable antihypertensive therapy.  F-Rmin, ACR on three non-consecutive morning urine samples, pulse wave velocity  (PWV), and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) were measured. Results ACR was  low (0.39 and 0.30-0.60), but abnormal small artery structure defined as  F-Rmin > mean + 2 standard deviations of normotensive value (1.99 + 1 mmHg  min/(ml/100 ml)) was present in 45% (n = 30).

Conclusions Abnormal microvascular  structure was present even in EH patients with low UAE.

The study was approved by the  Surgeon General, 5th US Army, and was designed to establish a circadian database  for 63 medically relevant variables of 13 young members of the Unit. The  subsequent studies, all in the month of May, in 1979, 1988, 1993,1998, and 2003,  followed the same protocol and were conducted at Edward Hines Jr., Veterans  Administration Hospital, after approval by Human Studies Subcommittees. Since a  reduction in Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) to the level of 60 ml/min/1.73m2 signals  the onset of kidney malfunction and since a concurrent increase in blood pressure  (BP) >140/90 mm Hg, contributes greatly to an unfavorable cardiovascular  prognosis, it seemed prudent to examine possible changes in these and in other  relevant variables in a group of young Army men, which may have developed over a  34 year period of time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen US Army male volunteers  (23-27y of age) served as subjects in the 1969 study. A majority of these men,  two additional Army men and two non-military subjects, participated in subsequent  studies: 1979 (7,2,1), 1988 (8,2,1), 1993 (5,4,1), 1998 (7,2,2), 2003 (7,2,1). In  each study, subjects were admitted to a hospital ward, were given medical  examination including a 12-lead electrocardiogram and followed the same Protocol.  Lights ""OUT"" at 22:30h and ""ON"" at 06:30h. The meals, hospital 2400-calorie  diets, were served at 17:30, 07:30 and at 13:30h. Vital signs were measured  immediately after each 3h urine collections, around the clock, and bloods were  collected every 3h. Blood, plasma, serum, saliva and urines were analyzed for  numerous analytes including creatinine, using automated laboratory systems.  Kidney functions were assessed using the measured and estimated glomerular  filtration rates. RESULTS: Over the 34y study span, 16 men provided sixty-one 24h  profiles for CrCl-related variables (urine volume, creatinine, and serum  creatinine) and fifty-eight profiles for BP. Using all normalized data, a  significant circadian rhythm was found for each of these variables. Significant  circadian variations in SBP, DBP, serum and urine creatinine, and urine volume,  were evident with peak levels, on average, occurring in the evening hours.  CONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects, age was associated with an increase in SBP and  urine volume and with a decrease in urine creatinine. In diabetic subjects, aging  was associated with increases in both blood pressure and Creatinine Clearance. It  is interesting to note that for the 3 subjects who at a later date developed  diabetes, the CrCl levels were higher than the 5 age-matched controls during each  study year, over the entire 34y observation span, including the period prior to  diagnosis.

However, these equations require complex  calculations and several parameters. We derived an equation to estimate  creatinine clearance (eCCr) rapidly. METHODS: We studied 61 randomly selected  patients. Our new formulae (eCCr) are eCCr (male) = weight/ creatinine; and eCCr  (female) = weight x 0.84/creatinine (both with weight in kg). We compared eCCr to  the long and short MDRD and C-G equations. RESULTS: Agreement between the MDRD  long and other formulae was determined using intraclass correlation (ICC);  agreement with patient staging for estimated GFR <60 was done by kappa  coefficient. ICCs were all >0.8, i.e., good overall agreement. ICCs were 0.96 for  MDRD short, 0.84 for eCCr and 0.81 for C-G. Agreements for patients with GFR >60  were lower. MDRD short yielded the best agreement (kappa = 0.88; ""good""  agreement) followed by eCCr (kappa = 0.69; ""fair"" agreement) and C-G (0.56). ROC  curve analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, 0.98 and 0.90 for  C-G, MDRD short and eCCr, respectively, as estimates of MDRD long (pe0.29). ROC  curve analysis showed AUC=0.93 for MDRD short and 0.94 for eCCr as estimates of  C-G (p=0.22). CONCLUSION: We conclude that eCCr is a simple formula to estimate  GFR at bedside, within a reasonable mathematical difference from the MDRD and C-G  equations. This estimate can alert the physician to change drug dosing or more  formally estimate GFR.","2010-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","408-414","","4","23","","J Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 20437395","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; ROC Curve; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum concentrations of unbound cerivastatin were calculated  for each individual from the concentration of total cerivastatin and  cerivastatin's fraction unbound at t = 2.5 hours. In contradiction to what had  been expected, renal impairment significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of  cerivastatin.

Also, serum albumin concentration was  the only factor significantly correlated to t 1/2 of cerivastatin. Significant  but slighter correlation with the AUC and Cmax of unbound cerivastatin was also  observed for creatinine clearance and cerivastatin's fraction unbound, while no  correlation was observed with total plasma protein.

No serious clinical complications were observed.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that creatinine clearance is not a good  parameter to calculate leucovorin rescue. MTX-related toxicity in this group of  patients receiving a dose of 1 or 2 g/m(2) and rescued with leucovorin without  monitoring serum MTX levels was acceptable.","2004-07","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","17-22","","1","43","","Pediatr Blood Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15170885","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Chile/epidemiology; Disease-Free Survival; Mouth Mucosa; Leucovorin/administration & dosage; *Drug Monitoring; Creatine/*blood; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control; Methotrexate/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality; Stomatitis/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the use of urea kinetics has become the standard in hemodialysis, its  usefulness in peritoneal dialysis is unclear. It has been suggested that  creatinine clearance may correlate with clinical outcome in CAPD but, as with  urea kinetics, its predictive value is not established. The efficacy number (EN),  which only requires a four hour exchange, was introduced as a simpler approach to  creatinine kinetics. These three kinetic models were correlated to clinical  outcome in 18 stable CAPD patients over a 12 month study period. The patients  were divided into three groups: good (G), intermediate (I), and poor (P) based on  uremic symptoms, mortality, hospital days, biochemical indices and the need for  transfer to hemodialysis. Both forms of creatinine kinetics (weekly creatinine  clearance, EN) were able to differentiate between the G, I, and P outcome groups  (P < 0.05). The weekly uea Kt/V was able to differentiate between the G and P  groups (P < 0.05) but not between the I and the other two outcome groups. Both  urea and creatinine kinetics predict clinical outcome in CAPD. However,  creatinine kinetics may be a more sensitive predictor. The efficacy number was  just as sensitive as creatinine clearance in predicting clinical outcome yet  simpler to gather the data for its calculation.","1992","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","79-83","","","8","","Adv Perit Dial","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 1361859","","","","Humans; Prognosis; Renal Dialysis; Hospitalization; Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy; Urea/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics; *Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Combining clinical risk factors, in addition to  small changes in serum creatinine, has been proposed to improve the assessment of  AKI. This notion was developed in order to identify the risk of AKI early in a  patient's clinical course. We set out to assess the performance of this  combination approach. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A secondary  analysis of data from a prospective multicenter intensive care unit cohort study  (September 2009 to April 2010) was performed. Patients at high risk using this  combination approach were defined as an early increase in serum creatinine of  0.1-0.4 mg/dl, depending on number of clinical factors predisposing to AKI. AKI  was defined and staged using the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. The  primary outcome was evolution to severe AKI (Acute Kidney Injury Network stages 2  and 3) within 7 days in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Of 506 patients, 214  (42.2%) patients had early creatinine elevation and were deemed at high risk for  AKI. This group was more likely to subsequently develop the primary endpoint  (16.4% versus 1.0% [not at high risk], P<0.001). The sensitivity of this grouping  for severe AKI was 92%, the specificity was 62%, the positive predictive value  was 16%, and the negative predictive value was 99%. After adjustment for  Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, serum creatinine, and hazard tier for  AKI, early creatinine elevation remained an independent predictor for severe AKI  (adjusted relative risk, 12.86; 95% confidence interval, 3.52 to 46.97). Addition  of early creatinine elevation to the best clinical model improved prediction of  the primary outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  increased from 0.75 to 0.83, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients at  high AKI risk, based on the combination of clinical factors and early creatinine  elevation, are significantly more likely to develop severe AKI. As initially  hypothesized, the high-risk combination group methodology can be used to identify  patients at low risk for severe AKI in whom AKI biomarker testing may be expected  to have low yield. The high risk combination group methodology could potentially  allow clinicians to optimize biomarker use.","2014-04","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","663-672","","4","9","","Clin J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24677553  PMCID: PMC3974351","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Prognosis; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment; Area Under Curve; Age Factors; Intensive Care Units; ROC Curve; Biomarkers/blood; Italy; Up-Regulation; Critical Illness; Acute Kidney Injury/blood/*diagnosis/etiology; Creatinine/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To incorporate SCI population-specific patient variables  into a predictive model for estimating CLcr and GFR. A retrolective study of  gentamicin clearance as a measure of GFR in patients with SCI. Each patient had  received a single, intravenous dose of gentamicin. Simultaneously, a 24-hour  creatinine clearance (CL(cr-24)) was obtained. Experimentally measured total body  clearance of a single intravenous administration of gentamicin (CL(gent-iv)) was  estimated from PK analyses of gentamicin disposition in patients with SCI.  Comparisons were made between CL(gent-iv) and predictors of GFR derived from a  SCI population-specific nomogram (SCI-psn), the method of Cockcroft and Gault  (C-G), CL(cr-24), and a multiplicative statistical model. A multiplicative model,  calculated gentamicin clearance (CL(gent-calc)), that incorporates SCI  population-specific characteristics to predict CL(cr-24) and GFR was derived from  a multivariate nonlinear regression analysis, and the strengths of association  between CL(gent-iv) and CL(gent-calc), and estimates of GFR derived from the  method of C-G, SCI-psn, and CL(cr-24) were tested. The best predictive  performance was demonstrated for CL(gent-iv) and the multiplicative model,  CL(gent-calc), when tested against CL(cr-24) or the SCI-psn, supporting our  premise that CL(gent-iv) can be used to estimate GFR in SCI. CL(gent-iv) and  CL(gent-calc) outperformed CL(cr-24), the method of C-G, and the SCI-psn as  predictors of GFR. The multiplicative model produced estimates of CL(gent-iv)  which were more precise and less biased than CL(cr-24), the standard  radiation-free predictor of GFR in patients with SCI, the SCI-psn, and the C-G  equation. In this preliminary study, the clearance of gentamicin administered  intravenously, CL(gent-iv), correlated highly with simultaneously measured  CL(cr-24).

This phenomenon has been associated with subtherapeutic  levels of renally cleared drugs such as vancomycin, which is dosed based on body  weight and creatinine clearance (CrCl). Many clinicians, however, cap CrCl at  120 mL/min/1.73 m(2) when calculating vancomycin dosing regimens. We hypothesize  that capping patient CrCl, as opposed to utilizing the non-capped CrCl, when  determining vancomycin dosing schemes results in subtherapeutic serum trough  concentrations in patients with TBI. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of  adult patients with TBI admitted between April 2014 and December 2015 who  received vancomycin. Population-based pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters using  non-capped calculated CrCl and capped CrCl were compared with patient-specific PK  parameters based on serum trough concentrations. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients  with TBI were included in the study. ARC was suspected in 24 (75%) patients due  to a median estimated CrCl at serum trough concentration of 167.3 (127.7-197.7)  mL/min. The mean dosing regimen was 17.1 (13.2-19.2) mg/kg every 8 (8-8) h. There  was no difference between the median measured trough concentration and predicted  value using non-capped CrCl [10.4 (7.1-15.0) vs. 11.5 (7.8-13.7) mcg/mL;  p = 0.7986]. The median measured trough concentration was significantly lower  than the predicted trough concentration when calculated based on capping the CrCl  at 120 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [16.3 (15.3-22.0) vs. 11.5 (7.8-13.7) mcg/mL;  p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with traumatic brain injury appeared to  exhibit augmented renal clearance, leading to subtherapeutic vancomycin serum  trough concentrations when doses were calculated using the traditional method of  capping creatinine clearance at 120 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Instead, utilizing  patients' non-capped creatinine clearance when determining a vancomycin dosing  regimen is more accurate and provides a better estimation of vancomycin  pharmacokinetics and could be applied to other renally excreted medications.","2019-02","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","126-131","","1","30","","Neurocrit Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30051194","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Pharmacokinetics; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Young Adult; Retrospective Studies; Critical Illness; Creatinine/*blood; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine clearance; Vancomycin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Brain Injuries, Traumatic/*blood; Infection; Infections/drug therapy; Traumatic brain injury; Vancomycin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the sensitivity and specificity of several strategies that use  creatinine to identify incomplete urine using the p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)  check method as reference. METHODS: Subjects were 654 female Japanese dietetic  students 18-22 y of age. A single 24-h urine sample was collected, with recording  of the time of the start and end of the collection period and missing urine  volume. Simultaneous administration of PABA was done to assess completeness. The  sensitivity and specificity of five strategies derived from the literature that  used creatinine to identify incomplete urine were calculated as the proportion of  incomplete and complete urine correctly identified, respectively. RESULTS: A  total of 7.6% of subjects was identified as having incomplete urine by PABA (PABA  recovery <85%). This proportion significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased (to 5.5%)  after considering self-reported collection time and missing urine volume in the  calculation of total urine volume. The sensitivity and specificity of the  strategy of Knuimann et al. (incomplete urine = <0.7 of [mmol urinary creatinine  x 113]/[21 x kilograms of body weight]) were 0.47 and 0.99, respectively. The  corresponding values of other strategies were 0.11-0.22 and 0.57-1.00,  respectively. CONCLUSION: At least in well-motivated populations in which the  proportion of incomplete urine is presumed to be small, the strategy of Knuimann  et al. and consideration of the self-reported collection time and missing urine  volume in the estimation of total volume may be useful.","2008-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","16-22","","1","24","","Nutrition","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17996421","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Japan; Female; Time Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Sensitivity and Specificity; Body Weight/physiology; Epidemiologic Studies; Creatinine/*urine; Biomarkers/urine; 4-Aminobenzoic Acid/*urine; Urinalysis/*standards; Vitamin B Complex/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty-nine concurrent Cin and CCr studies provided data for comparing Cin with  the measured CCr and with the calculated CCr (calc-CCr).

Thirty-one children 5.3-20.8 years of age, with Cin ranging from 2.8 to 138.8  ml/min per 1.73 m2, participated in these studies at The Children's Mercy  Hospital.

OBJECTIVE: To identify  potential discrepancies in sCr concentrations obtained by different assays, the  compensated Jaffe (sCr-Jaffe) and the enzymatic (sCr-enz), and to compare between  the eGFR and vancomycin daily dose, based on these sCr values. METHOD: sCr-Jaffe  and, sCr-enz concentrations of 890 healthy children, aged 1-18 years, were  available from the Canadian Laboratory Initiative in Pediatric Reference  Intervals study in Ontario. For each subject, eGFR (eGFR-Jaffe, eGFR-enz) was  calculated using the revised Schwartz equation, and vancomycin daily dose  (Vdose-Jaffe, Vdose-enz) was calculated using a sCr-based pharmacokinetic model.  RESULT: Significant, age-related differences were found in sCr concentrations,  and in subsequent eGFR and Vdose, between the two assays. In children aged 1-5  years, mean sCr-Jaffe was higher than sCr-enz (44.0 ± 5.0 vs. 27.7 ± 7.3 μmol/L,  P < 0.001), leading to lower eGFR-Jaffe (83.2 ± 9.0 vs.  137.9 ± 27.1 mL/min/1.73m2, P < 0.001) and lower Vdose-Jaffe (44.7 ± 2.5 vs.  53.5 ± 5.1 mg/kg/24 h, P < 0.001).

Clinicians can use the first equation to predict the effect of a  specific dose of a specific drug in specific circumstances on the basis of 3  variables: (1) the drug's pharmacodynamics, (2) the drug's pharmacokinetics, and  (3) biological variance in the individual patient. Clinicians can use the second  equation to determine the concentration of a drug that a patient will achieve on  a given dose depending on the patient's ability to clear the drug from the body.  These 2 equations allow prescribers to predict whether the dose of a drug a  patient is receiving is likely to achieve the desired clinical response (not so  low that it is clinically ineffective or so high that it causes adverse effects  that interfere with the patient's ability to tolerate or benefit from the  treatment).

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  This retrospective study was carried out using 168 serum samples from 88 patients  collected during routine clinical monitoring. Covariates recorded included  demographic parameters (gender, age, weight), clinical parameters (serum  creatinine, creatinine clearance), and intake of co-medications. The amisulpride  PPK model was established using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM)  approach. Goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots, bootstrap validation (1,000 runs), and  normalized prediction distribution error (NPDE) were used in the evaluation of  the final model. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and  elimination was developed. The population estimates for apparent clearance (CL/F)  and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) were 32.6 L/h and 391 L, respectively.  Estimated creatinine clearance (eCLcr) was a significant covariate for CL/F. The  established model was: CL/F = 32.6 × (eCLcr/114.3)0.485 (L/h). The stability of  the model was confirmed using GOF plots, bootstrap, and NPDE. CONCLUSION:  Creatinine clearance is a major covariate which is positively correlated with  CL/F. Therefore, additional dose adjustments of amisulpride may be required on  the basis of eCLcr. An ethnic difference may exist in the pharmacokinetics of  amisulpride, but further research is needed in order to confirm this possibility.  The PPK model of amisulpride for adult Chinese schizophrenic patients established  here using NONMEM, is potentially an important tool for individualizing drug  dosage and therapeutic drug monitoring.","2023-03-05","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","","","","","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 36871243","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SETTING: A ten-bed general ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eighteen  critically ill patients who were being treated with gentamicin or tobramycin for  severe infections, and were hemodynamically stable. INTERVENTIONS: The various  clearances were measured simultaneously after the administration of a dose of  aminoglycoside by assaying serial blood samples for aminoglycoside and creatinine  concentration, and by measuring the content of these substances in urine  collected over the same time period. OUTCOME MEASURES: The slopes, intercepts and  coefficients of determination (r2) of the various regressions were determined,  along with the 95% confidence intervals for the prediction of serum  aminoglycoside clearance from each other variable. RESULTS: Renal aminoglycoside  clearance, creatinine clearance, and estimated creatinine clearance accounted for  only 58%, 59%, and 62%, respectively, of the variance in serum aminoglycoside  clearance. Only 64% of the variance in renal aminoglycoside clearance was  explained by creatinine clearance. Substantial and variable nonrenal  aminoglycoside clearance was evident. CONCLUSIONS: The 95% confidence intervals  for the prediction of serum aminoglycoside clearance from each index of renal  function indicated that none of these indices provided acceptable accuracy for  the prediction of serum aminoglycoside clearance and dosage requirements in  critically ill patients. Renal aminoglycoside clearance was not better than  creatinine clearance in this respect, and thus no other index of renal function  is likely to be more accurate.

METHODS: Outpatients and inpatients having a history  of cardioembolic stroke or atrial fibrillation were included. After taking  dabigatran etexilate orally (75-150 mg twice daily) for at least 1 week, plasma  trough concentration (Ctrough, ng/mL) of dabigatran and creatinine clearance  (CLcr, mL/min) of patients according to Cockcroft and Gault equation were  determined.

Phosphate plasma  concentration drops very sharply during the first hour of dialysis and rises  rapidly during the rebound period.

However, even with high-dose treatment (ie, >  8 mg/kg), the safety of daptomycin treatment is widely demonstrated with low or  no significant incidence of CPK elevation or other adverse effects, despite the  possibility of C(trough) above 24.3 μg/mL. Therefore, we questioned the clinical  significance of C(trough) levels of 24.3 μg/mL. In this study, we retrospectively  evaluated the significance of C(trough) in the clinical setting, in addition to  completing a retrospective safety assessment of daptomycin utilizing electronic  health records. METHODS: Patients who had received daptomycin treatment for  > 4 days from July 2011 to June 2015 were enrolled. Serum daptomycin levels,  including C(trough) and peak (C(peak) ), were measured by high-performance liquid  chromatography equipped with a photodiode array. To evaluate the safety,  patients' characteristics and relevant laboratory test values were reviewed  retrospectively using an electronic medical record system. RESULTS AND  DISCUSSION: A total of 52 therapeutic cases for 46 patients were identified; of  these, C(trough) and C(peak) levels were measured in 27 and 28 cases,  respectively, and 6 patients received multiple courses of daptomycin treatment.  The median age of the 52 patients was 68 years (range: 19-88 years), and 14  patients initially had an estimated creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min.  Seven cases indicated a C(trough) of above 24.3 μg/mL; however, none of these  presented CPK elevation, which meets with the study definition for abnormality.  Furthermore, of the two patients with abnormal CPK elevations, only one patient  had a measured C(trough) (of 10.9 μg/mL). Their CPK abnormalities were temporal  and did not result in treatment discontinuation. The other four patients  discontinued daptomycin treatment due to suspicions of adverse effects. Of the  discontinued patients, two had measured C(trough) levels; these were 8.6 and  8.1 μg/mL. All patients with abnormal CPK elevation or treatment discontinuation  exhibited C(trough) levels lower than 24.3 μg/mL. In this study, two patients  receiving high-dose daptomycin (ie, 9.4 and 10.0 mg/kg) had observed C(trough)  levels similar to patients who received doses of daptomycin < 9 mg/kg. WHAT IS  NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: The safety of daptomycin treatment was suggested in this  study. C(trough) level of 24.3 μg/mL was not suggested as a significant clinical  index for the incidence of CPK elevation, adverse effects or treatment  discontinuation. Thus, acceptable tolerability towards higher C(trough) levels  than 24.3 μg/mL was also suggested, though further studies are required. On the  other hand, low levels of daptomycin in blood were unexpectedly observed in two  cases, despite the high-dose treatments.

For a given  new chemical entity, therefore, elevations in serum creatinine (SCr) can be  caused by the inhibition of renal transporter(s) without renal toxicity. In the  present study, an effort was made to assess the correlation between the  inhibition of renal transporters in vitro and elevations in SCr. A total of 15  compounds were chosen based on their known effect on SCr and minimal impact on  glomerular filtration rate. Their inhibition potencies against the major  creatinine renal transporters, including organic cation transporter 2, organic  anion transporter 2, and 2 forms of multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE1 and  MATE2K), were assessed in transporter-transfected cell lines using creatinine as  a probe substrate. Collectively, the data suggest that the observed elevations in  SCr can be attributed to the inhibition of renal transporter(s), but inhibition  of renal transporters does not necessarily lead to elevated SCr. Thus, renal  transporter inhibition data can be used to rationalize SCr changes. Additionally,  differing renal transporter inhibition potencies using creatinine and metformin  as probe substrates suggest that substrate-dependent inhibition exists for some  compounds.","2017-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","2535-2541","","9","106","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 American Pharmacists Association®.

The aim of the study was to explore  the status of serum albumin & creatinine clearance levels in smear positive  Bangladeshi pulmonary tuberculosis patients as a means to monitor the possibility  of management of these patients as these levels decrease significantly. Serum  albumin level was investigated in TB patients for monitoring the nutritional  status of TB patients and also for the adjustment of serum calcium level.  Creatinine clearance rate was investigated in TB patients for monitoring the  impairment of renal function and nutritional depletion in tuberculosis patients.  A total of 120 people of different age groups were included in this study.  Subjects were divided into two groups- Group I (Control; n=60) - apparently  healthy people selected matching by age, sex and socioeconomic status with the  cases and Group II (Case; n=60) - people with smear positive pulmonary  tuberculosis. Serum albumin was estimated by colorimetric principle. Serum  creatinine was also estimated by colorimetric principle & creatinine clearance  rate was estimated from serum creatinine by Cockcroft- Gault equation.  Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS windows package. Among the groups,  mean±SD of serum albumin in Group II (3.74±0.44gm/dl) was significantly lower  (p<0.001) than that in Group I (4.85±0.31gm/dl). Mean±SD of creatinine clearance  rate in Group II (35.36±8.29ml/min) was also significantly lower than that in  Group I (84.16±20.20ml/min).

A new rapid method  for determining GFR by radionuclide compound Tc-99m  diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) has been developed and widely used in  the last decade. The purpose of this study is to compare and correlate the  measurements of GFR by the two method. METHODS: The present series included 6  normal volunteer outpatients and 49 hospitalized patients with various degrees of  renal dysfunction who were studied at Taichung Veterans General Hospital from  June 1985 to June 1986. All patients underwent both Tc-99m DTPA GFR and 24-hour  CCr. Tc-99m DTPA computed GFR was calculated using the formula of Gates. RESULTS:  The radionuclide computed GFR for each subject was compared with his or her  24-hour CCr. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.89 with p < 0.001. The  subjects were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 6 normal volunteers  and 14 patients with serum creatinine less than 1.4 mg/dl (creatinine: normal  range 0.7 to 1.4 mg/dl). Group B consisted of 35 patients with serum creatinine  greater than 1.4 mg/dl. Group B was further divided into Subgroup 1 with serum  creatainine from 1.4 to 10 mg/dl, and Subgroup 2 with serum creatinine above 10  mg/dl. There was good correlation and less absolute error between DTPA-GFR and  CCr in Group A and Subgroup 1. The results suggest that, when serum creatinine is  less than 10 mg/dl, either DTPA or CCr is a good method for detection of GFR.  CONCLUSIONS: DTPA-GFR measurement using this radionuclide technique has shown  good correlation with CCr when serum creatinine is under 10 mg/dl. In patients  with renal impairment and with serum creatinine above 10 mg/dl, neither  examination is reliable. A more sensitive test to evaluate GFR in severe renal  impairment is required for further investigation.","1995-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","432-437","","6","55","","Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: China (Republic : 1949- ) PMID: 7634180","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics; *Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesised that a tropical climate may cause  adaptive changes in the entire organism leading to altered renal function in our  subjects. Hence renal function data for residents of a temperate climate may not  be applicable to tropical residents. We therefore sought to elucidate renal  function in subjects residing in a tropical climate. We used lithium clearance,  CLi, a non-invasive tool for assessing proximal tubular function in humans, and  endogenous creatinine clearance, CCr, to estimate proximal tubular function and  glomerular function, respectively, in our subjects. We did this in order to  establish whether or not nephron function in our subjects differs from that for  residents of a temperate climate. Nineteen male and 12 female Ghanaian subjects  aged between 15 and 48 years were studied. The estimated GCr was 117.3 +/- 6.6  ml/min for male subjects and 97 +/- 6.4 ml/min for female subjects. CLi was 20.3  +/- 1.6 ml/min for male and 19.1 +/- 0.4 ml/min for female subjects,  respectively. The estimated absolute reabsorption rate of fluid of proximal  tubules was 97.0 +/- 6.0 ml/min for males and 78.1 +/- 6.0 ml/min for females.  The percentage proximal fluid reabsorption for male and female subjects was 81.2  +/- 1.4 and 79.5 +/- 1.6, respectively. The differences between male and female  values (mean +/- SEM) were not statistically significant. The data suggest that  the proximal tubule in residents of a tropical climate may reabsorb more fluid  compared to that in residents of a temperate climate. Our values for proximal  tubular reabsorption are higher than those reported for residents of a  temperature climate. Our estimate of glomerular filtration, however, is similar  to published data for Caucasians. The difference in proximal tubular function may  reflect possible renal adaptation to a hot, humid climate. We conclude that renal  function of tropical residents differs from that of residents of a temperate  climate. This difference may be due to renal adaptation to the hot, tropical  climate.","1997-07","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","40-43","","1","41","","Int J Biometeorol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9334574","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Creatinine/metabolism; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/physiology; *Tropical Climate; Nephrons/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

INTERVENTIONS:  Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime,  piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at Clcr ranging from 120-30  ml/minute. The MIC data for 90% of organisms (MIC90) were collected for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter  freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean  MIC90 was calculated. The T>MIC was calculated as percentage of the dosing  interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean MIC90.  A T>MIC of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except S.  aureus (> or = 50%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours  (Clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (Clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved  desirable T>MIC for all Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus at every Clcr. Imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, and S.  aureus at every Clcr. However, imipenem T>MIC was less than 70% for the following  regimens and organisms: S. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 90  ml/min), E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 80 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5  g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 100 ml/min), S. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr  60-70 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), and E.  aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 50-70 ml/min). Ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (Clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (Clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable  T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus only. At every  dose and Clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable T>MIC for S. aureus but  not for any Enterobacteriaceae at Clcr > 50 ml/minute. Piperacillin did not  achieve desirable T>MIC for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a  T>MIC of 70% or above for P. aeruginosa at any Clcr. CONCLUSION: At every Clcr,  cefepime achieved a desirable T>MIC for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. Based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. However, when P.  aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be  considered.","1999-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1392-1399","","12","19","","Pharmacotherapy","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10600088","","","","Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Time Factors; Models, Biological; Creatinine/blood; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Anti-Bacterial Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Tazobactam; Cefepime; Bacteria/*drug effects; Ceftazidime/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Cephalosporins/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Imipenem/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Penicillanic Acid/analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Piperacillin/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because the use of highly accurate filtration markers to measure renal  function has traditionally been limited by cumbersome and costly techniques and  the involvement of radioactivity (among other factors), renal function is  typically estimated by using specially derived prediction equations. These  formulae usually use serum creatinine levels, i.e., a marker of filtration that  is insensitive to mild/moderate decreases in GFR. Although attempts have been  made to validate certain renal function prediction equations among patients with  chronic kidney disease (CKD) with abnormal serum creatinine levels, this is the  first study to specifically evaluate the predictive performance of these  equations for patients with CKD and serum creatinine levels in the normal range.  The results of eight prediction equations for 109 patients with CKD and serum  creatinine levels of < or =1.5 mg/dl were compared with standard iohexol GFR  values. The most accurate results were obtained with the Cockroft-Gault and  Bjornsson equations. The most precise formulae were the Modification of Diet in  Renal Disease Study equations, although they were highly biased. Even the most  accurate results exhibited levels of error that made them suboptimal for clinical  treatment of these patients. These results suggest that measurement of GFR with  endogenous or exogenous filtration markers might be the most prudent strategy for  the assessment of renal function in the CKD population with normal serum  creatinine levels. Further studies are needed to confirm the generalizability of  these findings for this patient subgroup.","2002-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","2140-2144","","8","13","","J Am Soc Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12138147","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; *Models, Biological; Chronic Disease; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Creatinine/*blood; Contrast Media/pharmacokinetics; Iohexol/pharmacokinetics; Kidney/metabolism/*physiopathology; Kidney Diseases/*blood/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of the NCSD demonstrated that urea kinetic modelling  (UKM) is a useful tool in the measurement of adequacy of dialysis: Kt/V values of  1 are considered adequate to prevent complications when daily protein intake is  appropriate. For CAPD no similar prospective studies exist, and consequently  there is no information comparable to that for haemodialysis. Preliminary data  have communicated controversial results about the usefulness of UKM for CAPD  prescription. On the other hand creatinine kinetics has been proposed as an  alternative to UKM to define adequacy of dialysis on CAPD. However, these results  should be considered preliminary because of the small size of the series and the  short observation period. The objective of this paper is to study the role of  these two kinetic models in defining adequacy of dialysis in a long-term,  selected CAPD population. We have studied 56 patients treated for at least 3  years on CAPD (3-11 years; mean observation period 5 years; 3996 patient-months).  Urea kinetic model (UKM) (urea weekly (W) Kt/V and NPCR) and creatinine kinetics  (Efficacy number (EN) and K) were determined annually. According to the present  data we can conclude that Kt/V is an appropriate tool for defining adequacy in  patients on CAPD. Values of weekly Kt/V greater than 1.7-1.8, with NPCR more than  1 g/kg/day, assure an adequate clinical outcome. Conversely, values on the Kt/V  scale less than 1.7 entail a greater rate of complications. Our data also confirm  that maintaining a serum albumin > 536-551 mumol/l (3.7-3.8 g/dl) is related to  lower morbidity and mortality, and should be a major objective for CAPD patients.  Consequently a relationship between dose of dialysis in terms of urea mass  balance and protein nutrition can be established. After 5 years on CAPD, when all  residual renal function is generally lost, Kt/V values in excess of 1.9 are  difficult to achieve. Based on currently available information, we do agree with  the interest of performing a prospective study on adequacy of dialysis based on  the urea kinetic model in CAPD, which definitely defines its role. On the other  hand, creatinine kinetics did not show sufficient discriminative capacity in  terms of adequacy of dialysis.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this  study we evaluated the accuracy and precision of measured and calculated C(Cr) as  indexes of GFR by comparing their values to those of inulin clearance (C(In)) in  10 healthy subjects and 20 patients with either Child's class A or Child's class  C liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: The accuracy and precision of GFR estimates obtained  by measuring C(Cr) were good in all three study groups. The mean values of the  C(Cr)/C(In) ratio were 1.05, 1.03 and 1.04, respectively, and the corresponding  coefficients of variations were 2.9, 2.9 and 3.8%. A close correlation between  C(Cr) and C(In) was also found in each study group (r = 0.98, 0.99 and 0.97,  respectively, with p < 0.001 in each case). C(Cr) calculated from serum  creatinine by means of the Cockcroft-Gault formula (predicted GFR) proved to be a  suitable measure of GFR in normal subjects and patients with Child's class A  cirrhosis: the predicted-to-true GFR ratios were 0.93 and 0.94, respectively, CV  was 12% in both cases. Moreover, a significant correlation between predicted and  true GFR was observed in both groups (r = 0.73, p < 0.02 and r = 0.69, p < 0.025,  respectively). On the contrary, in Child's class C cirrhotics, calculated C(Cr)  significantly overestimated GFR (predicted-to-true GFR ratio 1.23, CV 20%) and no  significant correlation was found between predicted and true GFR (r = 0.58, p >  0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study shows that measured C(Cr) is a  reliable index of GFR in cirrhotic patients, irrespective of the degree of liver  dysfunction. Calculated C(Cr) is still an adequate marker of GFR in patients with  compensated liver cirrhosis, whereas it overestimates GFR in patients with  decompensated cirrhosis. A lower muscle mass, a reduced ability to convert  creatine to creatinine, and the presence of ascites are most likely responsible  for the overestimation of GFR by the Cockcroft-Gault formula in the latter  patients.","1999-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","341-347","","6","51","","Clin Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 10404694","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Liver Cirrhosis/*physiopathology; Inulin/metabolism; Creatinine/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In a  retrospective case control study, all histologically confirmed cases of chronic  rejection (n=45) that occurred between 1985 and 1993 among patients transplanted  at Huddinge Hospital were compared with twice as many controls. Determinants such  as donor age and sex, HLA-mismatch, cold ischemia time, recipient age and sex,  body mass index, cause of renal disease, time undergoing dialysis, condition of  blood vessels at surgery, time of onset, number of acute rejection episodes  during the first 3 months, area under the serum creatinine versus time curve  (AUC(Creatinine)), blood pressure, blood lipids, and cyclosporine concentrations  at various times after the transplantation were also compared. Additional data  were obtained from a questionnaire, concerning 79% of the cases and controls.  RESULTS: Cases and controls were similar with regard to most determinants, that  is, blood pressure, blood lipids, and average cyclosporine concentrations. The  main outstanding risk factor for chronic rejection was the time-averaged  creatinine (AUC(Creatinine)) value between day 22 and 3 months after  transplantation. The adjusted odds ratio for chronic rejection increased stepwise  from 1.1 to 9.2, when AUC(Creatinine) increased from < 150 to >300 micromol/l.  The number of acute rejection episodes and number of HLA-mismatches also had a  significant effect on the risk of chronic rejection. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the  risk of developing chronic rejection after renal transplantation acute rejection  episodes during the first 3 months should be avoided as much as possible.","2000-03-15","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","964-968","","5","69","","Transplantation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10755558","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Prognosis; Time Factors; Risk Factors; Area Under Curve; Odds Ratio; Retrospective Studies; *Kidney Transplantation; Chronic Disease; Graft Rejection/*etiology; Creatinine/*blood; Blood Group Incompatibility; HLA Antigens/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years,  the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has replaced the serum creatinine as the  standard parameter for its determination. Our objective was to analyze which  renal function parameter (creatinine or GFR) at 1 year after HT better classified  patients who will die during follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included  316 consecutive HT patients surviving at least 1 year after transplantation.  Creatinine and GFR were determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease  Study (MDRD4) equation. Mortality during the follow-up was analyzed to compare  both parameters using receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: Over a  mean follow-up of 6±3 years, 97 patients died (30.7%). At 1 year after HT, the  patients who succumbed displayed a significantly higher mean creatinine value  (1.63±0.65 vs 1.41±0.64 mg/dL; P=.004) and a more decreased GFR (53.8 vs 60.8  mL/min/1.73 m2; P=.006). Both groups had the same area under the curve, 0.61 (95%  confidence interval: 0.54-0.68; P=.002). CONCLUSION: Among our population, GFR  calculated by the abbreviated MDRD4 equation did not provide any additional  prognostic value to serum creatinine at 1 year after HT to predict long-term  mortality.","2010-10","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","3196-3198","","8","42","","Transplant Proc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanisms driving this phenomenon are largely unknown. The  aim of this project was therefore to explore changes in renal function, cardiac  output (CO), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations in patients with  isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI). This prospective observational cohort  study was conducted in a tertiary-level, university-affiliated intensive care  unit (ICU). Patients with normal plasma creatinine concentrations (<120 μmol/L)  at admission and no history of chronic kidney disease, admitted with isolated  TBI, were eligible for enrollment. Continuous CO measures were obtained using  arterial pulse waveform analysis. Eight-hour urinary creatinine clearances  (CL(CR)) were used to quantify renal function. ANP concentrations in plasma were  measured on alternate days. Data were collected from study enrollment until ICU  discharge, death, or day 15, which ever came first. Eleven patients, contributing  100 ICU days of physiological data, were enrolled into the study. Most  participants were young men, requiring mechanical ventilation. Median ICU length  of stay was 9.6 [7.8-13.0] days. Elevated CL(CR) measures (>150 mL/min) were  frequent and appeared to parallel changes in CO. Plasma ANP concentrations were  also significantly elevated over the study period (minimum value = 243 pg/mL).  These data suggest that ARC is likely to complicate the care of TBI patients with  normal plasma creatinine concentrations, and may be driven by associated  cardiovascular changes and/or elevated plasma ANP concentrations. However,  significant additional research is required to further understand these findings.","2017-01-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","137-144","","1","34","","J Neurotrauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27302851","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Kidney/*metabolism; biomarkers; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/*blood; Metabolic Clearance Rate/*physiology; Creatinine/*blood; Cardiac Output/*physiology; Brain Injuries, Traumatic/*blood/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; clinical management of CNS injury; traumatic brain injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because these collections are  cumbersome and at times unreliable, the use of a calculated CrCl was evaluated as  a potential alternative. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on data  from all 287 treatment cycles from the 25 patients with PCNSL who participated in  a multi-center phase II clinical trial of HDMTX conducted by the New Approaches  to Brain Tumor Therapy (NABTT) CNS Consortium. RESULTS: The 25 patients had a  median age of 61 years (range 32-75). Seventeen (68%) were men. The patients  received a median of 14 (range 2-21) HDMTX treatments. For 256 of 287 treatments  (89%), data were available to compare the measured and calculated (using the  Cockcroft-Gault equation) CrCl. The average measured CrCl was 93 ml/min (95% CI,  89-96 ml/min), and the average calculated CrCl was 107 ml/min (95% CI, 102-112  ml/min). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was 0.49 (P<0.0001) between the  measured and calculated CrCl. The average MTX dose determined using measured CrCl  was 14.1 g (95% CI, 13.6-14.5 g), and the average MTX dose determined using  calculated CrCl was 14.7 g (95% CI, 14.2-15.1 g). MTX doses based on measured and  calculated CrCl were significantly correlated (r=0.72, P<0.0001). Of the 256  HDMTX treatments evaluated, 158 (62%) had reliable 48 h serum MTX levels  documented. Forty-seven levels (30%) were within target range (0.3-1 micromol/l),  99 levels (62%) were below target range (<0.3 micromol/l), 12 levels (8%) were in  the range associated with mild toxicity range (>1-3 micromol/l), and no levels  were in the range associated with severe toxicity (>3 micromol/l). Of these 158  treatments, the use of a calculated rather than measured CrCl would have yielded  an identical MTX dose for 48 treatments (30%), a higher MTX dose for 62  treatments (40%), and a lower MTX dose for 48 treatments (30%). This distribution  was not significantly different among the subsets of below target, within target  range, and above target MTX levels (P=0.87). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of  patients with PCNSL, there is significant correlation between the calculated and  measured CrCl. MTX doses determined using calculated and measured CrCl are not  significantly different. For these patients, there is no clear association  between the method of determining CrCl and serum MTX levels. As a result,  calculated CrCl is a reasonable alternative to measured CrCl in this patient  population and would avoid the inconvenience and potential inaccuracies  associated with measured CrCl.","2007-05","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","817-823","","6","59","","Cancer Chemother Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 16972068","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Retrospective Studies; Kidney Function Tests/*methods; Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/urine; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*urine; Methotrexate/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study  aims to develop a predictive model of urinary excretion of creatinine-normalized  cannabinoids (U(CNC) ) and to determine U(CNC) thresholds corresponding to the  widely used cut-offs of 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL for cannabinoids. One hundred  thirty-two patients with 452 urine samples were included between 2013 and 2017.  Urinary cannabinoids and U(CNC) elimination curves were computed for each  patient. Using a mono-exponential mixed effect model with 88 samples from 26  subjects exhibiting at least 3 decreasing U(CNC) in a row, the average calculated  elimination rate constant was 0.0108 ± 0.0026 h(-1) , corresponding to a mean  elimination half-life of 64 ± 12 hours. The use of U(CNC) is of particular  interest because of a high inter- and intra-individual variability of urinary  creatinine concentration (from 0.06 to 3.81 mg/mL). Moreover, U(CNC) allows for  the detection of diluted or concentrated urine specimens that may lead to false  positive (FP) or false negative (FN) results. Receiver operator characteristic  (ROC) curves were used to assess U(CNC) thresholds of 32.4 and 124.7 ng/mg that  provide a strong discrimination between positive and negative samples for  cannabinoids cut-offs of 20 and 50 ng/mL respectively. The developed model and  the defined U(CNC) thresholds allowed for the accurate prediction of the time  needed to reach a negative U(CNC) result that could be used by clinicians to  optimize clinical care.","2019-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1453-1459","","9","11","","Drug Test Anal","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31261442","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Substance Abuse Detection; Creatinine/*urine; modeling; cannabinoids; creatinine; Cannabinoids/*urine; Marijuana Abuse/complications/*therapy/*urine; Marijuana Smoking/therapy/urine; Mental Disorders/complications; monitoring; psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The total number of prescribed  medications was 2808 and 48.3% (1357 medications) required renal dose adjustment.  Of the 1357 medications, 12.6% (171 medications) were found to be inappropriately  prescribed according to eGFR. The most common inappropriately prescribed  medications were famotidine, metformin, perindopril, and ramipril. A significant  portion of medications used in heart failure requires dose adjustment.

METHODS: Patients with  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 118) who have used or still use antimalarials  (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine). Serum creatinines prior to antimalarials and  serum creatinines during antimalarials were recorded and the creatinine clearance  was estimated. RESULTS: The mean creatinine clearance decreased from 99 ml/min to  92 ml/min (p < 0.001) after the start of antimalarial drugs. Fifty-five percent  of the patients with chloroquine compared to 15% of the patients with  hydroxychloroquine (chi 2 = 17.8; p < 0.001) had more than 10% decrease of the  creatinine clearance. Age (beta = 0.004; p = 0.0002) and the kind of antimalarial  (beta = 0.095; p = 0.0002) were strong independent predictors of the decrease of  the creatinine clearance in the multiple regression analysis. For patients using  chloroquine the mean age adjusted decrease of creatinine clearance was 11.2%.  CONCLUSION: Antimalarials cause a significant reduction of the creatinine  clearance. The use of chloroquine and older age were associated with decreased  creatinine clearance. Whether antimalarials affect glomerular filtration or  tubular excretion of creatinine remains to be investigated.","1995-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","34-37","","1","22","","J Rheumatol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 7699677","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use; Kidney/drug effects; Creatinine/*blood; Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*blood/complications/drug therapy; Chloroquine/*adverse effects; Gold/therapeutic use; Hydroxychloroquine/*adverse effects; Penicillamine/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of creatinine methodology on these estimates is not always  appreciated. We have studied differences in creatinine methods and their  influence on GFR estimation specifically in older people. METHODS: In all, 46  older patients (mean age 80 y, range 69-92 y) with predominantly mild or moderate  kidney disease were studied. Serum creatinine was measured using a rate Jaffe  method and two different enzymatic methods. Isotope dilution mass spectrometry  served as the reference creatinine method. GFR was estimated using both the  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Cockcroft and Gault formulae: a  51Cr-EDTA GFR estimation served as the reference GFR method. RESULTS: Both  enzymatic methods produced creatinine results that were significantly different  (P<0.001) from the reference method. The Jaffe method over- and underestimated  creatinine at low and high concentrations, respectively. The most likely  explanation for these differences relates to standardization of the assays.  Irrespective of creatinine method, the Cockroft and Gault formula tended to  underestimate GFR, and the MDRD formula to overestimate GFR. Use of the differing  creatinine methods to estimate GFR produced predictable biases of the estimate,  with mean GFR estimates varying by 14% across the creatinine methods. CONCLUSION:  Estimates of GFR depend critically upon the accuracy and precision of the  creatinine measurement used in their calculation.","2005-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","11-18","","Pt 1","42","","Ann Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15802027","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Sensitivity and Specificity; Creatinine/*blood; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology; Chromium Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics; Edetic Acid/metabolism; Kidney Diseases/blood/*diagnosis; Statistics as Topic/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirty clinically healthy adult subjects with no  history of renal dysfunction were used for the study.

In patients with low daily urine  creatinine excretion (UCr), however, the UPCR may overestimate 24-h UP.

METHODS: This study included 442 children whose 24-h UP and spot UPCR  were measured concomitantly. Estimated 24-h UCr was calculated using three  previously existing equations. We estimated the 24-h UP excretion from UPCR by  multiplying the estimated UCr. The results were compared with the measured 24-h  UP. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between UPCR and 24-h UP (r = 0.801,  P < 0.001), and the correlation improved after multiplying the UPCR by the  measured UCr (r = 0.847, P < 0.001). Using the estimated UCr rather than the  measured UCr, there was high accuracy and strong correlation between the  estimated UPCR weighted by the Cockcroft-Gault equation and 24-h UP. Improvement  was also observed in the subgroup (proteinuria vs. non-proteinuria) analysis,  particularly in the proteinuria group.

A moderate  reversible increase in creatinine plasma levels has been reported with  fenofibrate therapy; however, it is not known whether this increased  creatininemia reflects a fenofibrate induced alteration of renal function or if  fenofibrate interferes with creatinine tubular handling. We prospectively  examined the effect of 2 weeks fenofibrate treatment (200 mg daily) on renal  function in thirteen hyperlipidemic patients with normal renal function or mild  to moderate renal failure (Creat Cl: 110 to 30 ml/min). This study confirms that  fenofibrate therapy significantly increases creatininemia in patients with mild  to moderate renal failure (147 +/- 12 versus 170 +/- 15 mmol/l; p = 0.014), but  does not alter renal hemodynamic nor glomerular filtration rate as assessed by  the stability of PAH (304 +/- 56 versus 311 +/- 49 ml/min; p = NS) and inulin  clearances (51.7 +/- 6 versus 52.3 +/- 7 ml/min; p = NS). The increase in  creatininemia is neither due to an inhibition of creatinine tubular excretion,  since no change in creatinine clearance was observed (69 +/- 8 versus 68 +/- 8  ml/min; p = NS), but appears to be associated to a parallel increase in  creatinine daily urinary excretion (13.7 +/- 5 versus 15.4 +/- 4 mmol; p = 0.03).  In conclusion, fenofibrate therapy in renal patients does not worsen renal  function, nor diminish the reliability of creatinine clearance for its follow-up  in spite of a significant rise in creatininemia. The mechanism of the  fenofibrate-induced increase in urinary creatinine excretion remains to be  determined.","1999","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","41-44","","1","20","","Nephrologie","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 10081035","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Prospective Studies; Cross-Over Studies; Uric Acid/blood; Natriuresis/drug effects; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/metabolism; Creatinine/*blood/urine; Urea/urine; Fenofibrate/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Hyperlipoproteinemias/complications/*drug therapy; Hypolipidemic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood/complications/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have found blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine  (BUN/Cr) ratio to be significantly elevated among patients UGIB bleeding compared  to patients with lower GI bleeding. However, no studies have explored the  relationship between BUN/Cr ratio and mortality. This study is aimed at  investigating how BUN/Cr ratio relates to outcomes for UGIB patients. PATIENTS  AND METHODS: This study was conducted prospectively at a university-affiliated  teaching hospital with approximate 70,000 annual emergency department (ED)  visits. Data from a total of 258 adult UGIB patients were collected between March  1, 2011 and March 1, 2012. Cox regression analysis was used to identify risk  factors for 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Malignancy and Rockall score were  associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality (Unadjusted hazard ratio (HR):  3.87, 95% CI: 1.59-9.41, p = 0.0029; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02-1.71, p = 0.0476,  respectively). However, BUN/Cr > 30 was associated with lower risk of 30-day  mortality (HR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.11-0.97, p = 0.0441). CONCLUSIONS: A BUN/Cr ratio  of >30 was found to be an independent risk factor for mortality and may be useful  for pre-endoscopic assessment.

The ACCR and the renal clearances of  beta 2-microglobulin (B2-m), similarly related to creatinine (BCCR) as well as  the urinary concentration of albumin, were compared in 27 patients with acute  pancreatitis, 8 with a perforated peptic ulcer and 7 with mild biliary colic,  during the first 5 days in hospital. Acute pancreatitis was graded as mild (6),  moderate (14) or severe (7), using a combination of clinical data, diagnostic  peritoneal lavage and multiple criteria. Further assessment of the severity of  the acute illness was obtained from measurement of C-reactive protein (C-RP).  Lowest C-RP levels were found in the patients with mild pancreatitis and biliary  colic, and highest levels in the patients with severe pancreatitis and perforated  ulcer (P less than 0.002). Similarly, ACCR and BCCR levels were significantly  lower in the two mild groups than in the two severe ones (P less than 0.01 and  less than 0.002 respectively), although plasma amylase was raised only in  patients with pancreatitis and plasma B2-m was similar in all groups.  Electrophoresis of urine showed dense bands of tubuloprotein in patients from  both severe groups. Urine albumin was higher in severe pancreatitis than in  perforated ulcer (P less than 0.1), perhaps indicating a more specific glomerular  lesion in pancreatitis. Thus a rise in amylase clearance appeared to be related  to the severity of the acute illness, and may be a component of a non-specific  tubuloproteinuria. In this study patients with a perforated peptic ulcer had  increases in ACCR similar to those seen in patients with severe pancreatitis, and  we are therefore doubtful whether ACCR has any role in the clinical diagnosis of  pancreatic disease.","1982-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","29-32","","1","69","","Br J Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 6172175","","","","Humans; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Acute Disease; C-Reactive Protein/metabolism; Albuminuria/metabolism; Creatinine/*metabolism; Amylases/*metabolism; beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism; Biliary Tract Diseases/metabolism; Colic/metabolism; Pancreatitis/diagnosis/*metabolism; Peptic Ulcer Perforation/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UP plasma and urinary platinum levels were quantitated using a high-performance  liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay, which was selective for cisplatin and active  platinum metabolites. Creatinine clearance was determined in all patients at the  time of the pharmacokinetic studies and ranged from 58 to 214 mL/min. Creatinine  clearance was a poor predictor of UP disposition in patients, probably as a  consequence of the complex renal clearance mechanism for UP in the human kidney,  which involves both tubular secretion and reabsorption. However, the peak plasma  level of UP was closely related to the area under curve (AUC) of UP (r2 = .831),  P less than .0001) and was significantly correlated with the decline in  creatinine clearance observed after four courses of cisplatin therapy to 12 of  the patients (r2 = .727, P less than .005). Cisplatin dose and the AUC of UP were  less satisfactory predictors of the change in creatinine clearance with four  courses of therapy (r2 = .488, P less than .025 and r2 = .623, P less than .005).  The large interpatient variability in all the parameters of cisplatin disposition  measured in this study suggested that there may be a role for individualization  of cisplatin dosage based on a peak level obtained in the first course of  therapy. Longer term infusion of cisplatin could also be justified.","1987-02","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","304-309","","2","5","","J Clin Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3806171","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Middle Aged; Aged; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Creatinine/*blood; Neoplasms/*drug therapy; Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced; Cisplatin/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The actual vancomycin maintenance dose needed to sustain  an average steady-state vancomycin concentration of 15 mg/L was determined based  on individual pharmacokinetic values. Predicted vancomycin maintenance doses were  generated using the vancomycin-clearance:creatinine-clearance relationships  derived separately by Nielsen, Moellering, Rotschafer, and Matzke. Orthogonal  regression analysis was used to determine relationships between actual and  predicted maintenance doses. Predictive ability of each method was assessed for  bias (mean error) and precision (root mean squared error). Mean error and root  mean squared error (+/- S.D.), respectively, for the four methods were as  follows: Nielsen -262 +/- 451, 522 +/- 718; Moellering -91 +/- 439, 448 +/- 547;  Rotschafer 192 +/- 602, 632 +/- 682; and Matzke -76 +/- 101, 408 +/- 517. Doses  predicted by the Nielsen relationship were significantly lower than the actual  vancomycin maintenance doses. Use of the Rotschafer relationship resulted in  substantial overprediction, which increased as creatinine clearance declined.  Doses predicted by the Moellering and Matzke relationships were slightly less  than but not significantly different from the actual dose. The Matzke method  demonstrated the least bias and was the most precise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250  WORDS)","1985-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","311-315","","3","4","","Clin Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 4006395","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Middle Aged; Aged; Models, Biological; Half-Life; Creatinine/*metabolism; Vancomycin/administration & dosage/*metabolism/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most common method in  current use involves calculation of substance-to-creatinine concentration ratios.  For accuracy, this method assumes creatinine excretion rates to be stable despite  varying rates of urinary flow. However, this underlying assumption has been  challenged in recent studies. Our evaluation of separate data regarding  individual voids confirmed that creatinine excretion rate depends significantly  (p less than .0001) on urinary flow. We calculated a logarithmic regression model  identical to one reported previously. The partial correlation coefficient for log  flow was .21 after adjusting for inter-individual differences in creatinine  excretion rates. We propose a simple method to correct creatinine concentrations  in ""spot"" urine samples for the effects of varying hydration.

An individual dosing strategy has been recommended to yield  the most optimal exposure, expressed as the area under the concentration-time  curve (AUC). The formula developed by Calvert et al. (dose = target-AUC x [GFR +  25]) can be used to achieve this. However, due to the inconvenient  [51Cr]-ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid ([51Cr]-EDTA)-based measurement of the  glomerular filtration rate (GFR), its application in the clinic has thus far been  limited. Chatelut and co-workers have recently proposed a formula to estimate  carboplatin clearance using the serum creatinine concentration. We  retrospectively tested the Chatelut equation and the Calvert formula using either  the creatinine clearance based on 24-h urine collection or the creatinine  clearance based on the formula of Cockcroft and Gault. The latter equations were  shown to predict the carboplatin clearance reasonably well, although systematic  overprediction and underprediction occurred. However, the formula proposed by  Chatelut and co-workers had no significant bias and was precise. It is proposed  that this formula be used to calculate the optimal carboplatin dosage after  prospective validation has been performed.","1996","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","266-270","","3","37","","Cancer Chemother Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8529288","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Half-Life; Linear Models; Retrospective Studies; Mathematical Computing; Creatinine/*blood; Carboplatin/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to determine the incidence of renal insufficiency (a  CrCl <60 mL/min) among patients who have serum Cr below 1.5 mg/dL (the most  commonly accepted Cr cutoff for the administration of intravenous contrast). This  study was conducted in a population of emergency department patients with acute  abdominal pain being considered for CT scan. METHODS: We performed post hoc  analysis of a prospective cross-sectional study that enrolled nongravid adults  with acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. Patients on dialysis were excluded. The  data that we collected included demographics, history, duration/description of  pain, patient reported weight, laboratory data, imaging studies, and final  diagnosis. Creatinine clearance values (< or >60 mL/min) were compared to Cr  values of 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 mg/dL to determine the percentage of patients at  risk for nephropathy after contrast injection at each Cr cutoff. Descriptive  statistics were used with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Seven hundred  sixty-five patients were enrolled; 59% (451/765) had an abdominal CT scan. Of 108  patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min, 59 patients had a Cr less than 1.8 mg/dL  (55%; 95% CI, 45%-64%); 43 had a Cr less than 1.5 mg/dL, the most commonly  accepted Cr cutoff for contrast administration (40%; 95% CI, 31%-50%); 21  patients had a Cr less than 1.2 mg/dL (19%; 95% CI, 12%-28%); and 10 had a Cr  less than 1.0 mg/dL (9%; 95% CI, 5%-16%). CONCLUSION: The most commonly used Cr  cutoff (1.5 mg/dL) for contrast administration fails to identify 40% of the  patients at risk for CIN. Future studies should address whether using CrCl rather  than serum Cr decreases the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy.","2007-03","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","268-272","","3","25","","Am J Emerg Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17349899","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Prospective Studies; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Cross-Sectional Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data; Acute Kidney Injury/*chemically induced; Contrast Media/*adverse effects; Abdominal Pain/*blood/classification/diagnostic imaging; Creatinine/*blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this, the clinical employment of equations for estimating  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been scarcely investigated so far in this  age group. Our study compared 2 commonly employed equations to estimate GFR, as  well as measured 24-hour creatinine clearance (CrCl), in patients aged >or=85  years. METHODS: Seventy-three patients consecutively admitted over 4 months to  our Internal Medicine Department had an accurate 24-hour urinary collection, as  well as serum and urinary creatinine determinations. Measured CrCl was compared  with the GFR values estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)  Study and Mayo Clinic quadratic (MCQ) equations. RESULTS: GFR values derived by  MDRD and MCQ equations and CrCl significantly differed from each other in the  whole sample. CrCl negatively correlated with age (r=-0.389, p<0.001), at  variance with GFR levels obtained by both the MDRD and the MCQ equations. The 3  estimates of renal function significantly correlated with each other, these  correlations persisting after correcting for age, serum albumin and 24-hour  urinary creatinine. Despite the visual impression of Bland and Altman plots, the  overall agreement between methods was poor. Moreover, the proportion of patients  classified by the 3 GFR estimates into each stage of kidney disease as specified  in the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines  significantly differed.

The patients were allocated to one of five  groups according to the length of drug exposure: Group 1 (4-7 days; n = 31),  Group 2 (8-14 days; n = 22), Group 3 (15-21 days; n = 13), Group 4 (22-28 days; n  = 8), and Group 5 (longer than 29 days; n = 11).

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was  measured with 125I-iothalamate clearance (CTh). The initial CCr of 65 ml/min  (median) was reduced to a nadir of 46 ml/min (p less than 0.01) during the first  2 h after infusion of cimetidine. GFR remained unchanged, and thus the fractional  clearance of creatinine (CCr/CTh) was reduced from 1.43 (median) to 1.03 (p less  than 0.01). CNa and the fractional excretion of sodium decreased throughout the  study (p less than 0.05); CLi was unchanged. In conclusion cimetidine, when  measured during 1-h clearance periods, interferes with tubular creatinine  secretion in the denervated kidney of transplant recipients without affecting the  glomerular filtration rate or proximal tubular flow. This suggests that on-going  cimetidine treatment must be taken into account when graft function is evaluated  by the CCr alone.","1989-04","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","155-159","","2","49","","Scand J Clin Lab Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2520367","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Cimetidine/*pharmacology; Absorption; *Kidney Transplantation; Creatinine/*urine; Sodium/metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects; Lithium/metabolism; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it has been suggested that in  cystic fibrosis (CF), creatinine clearance (CrCl) is not a good predictor of  tobramycin clearance because of a lack of correlation. The aim of this study was  to investigate the correlation between the tobramycin clearance and the measured  CrCl. In addition, because most pharmacokinetic computer models use an a priori  relationship between CrCl and tobramycin elimination rate constant [k(el)],  regression analysis of k(el) on CrCl was performed. Eighteen CF patients (12 men,  6 women, ages 21-55 years) were treated with intravenous tobramycin. Blood and  urine samples were collected for tobramycin analysis and determination of the  CrCl. For each patient, CrCl was also estimated using the formulas of Cockcroft  and Gault (C/G), Jelliffe I (J I), and Jelliffe II (J II). Predictive performance  of these formulas was evaluated using mean error and mean squared error as  reflections of bias and precision. Tobramycin total body clearance as well as  renal clearance correlated significantly with CrCl (r = 0.52; p = 0.02 and r =  0.78; p = 0.02, respectively). Regression of the tobramycin k(el) versus CrCl  gave the following equation: k(el) = 0.135 + 0.00134*CrCl/1.73 m2 (r = 0.64; p =  0.004).

M.","Using estimated creatinine clearance for individualizing drug therapy: a reassessment.","DICP : the annals of pharmacotherapy","","1042-9611","10.1177/106002809002401209","","Estimates of renal function are frequently used to design individual dosing regimens. The accuracy of these estimates naturally influences their ability to  predict certain pharmacokinetic parameters and appropriate drug dosages.  Creatinine clearance is the most widely used estimate of renal function. Many  formulas have been developed to provide a quick, relatively accurate prediction  of creatinine clearance and, supposedly, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  However, an understanding of the limitations associated with creatinine clearance  estimations raises questions concerning their reliability as an aid in  individualizing drug therapy. Many factors such as disease states, age, diet,  analytical variations, and drug interactions affect the relationship between  estimates and measures of creatinine clearance and GFR. As a result, creatinine  clearance estimates using these formulas are often poor reflections of measured  creatinine clearance or GFR. Also, studies comparing measured creatinine  clearance with more accurate methods of assessing renal function (i.e., inulin)  reveal errors that are often exaggerated as renal function declines. Therefore,  estimated creatinine clearance is twice removed from the associated  pharmacokinetic parameter. Despite these limitations, no other clinically  relevant and convenient assessment of renal function is available. The authors  recommend that the appropriate caveats be considered when using these tools  clinically. For drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, estimates of creatinine  clearance should only be used to establish initial dosing regimens, with  subsequent therapy based on parameters generated from concentration  determinations.","1990-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1185-1190","","12","24","","DICP","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2089830","","","","Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Drug Interactions; Age Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Diet; Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Drug Therapy; Creatinine/blood/*metabolism; Kidney/metabolism/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a retrospective analysis of  185 patients who underwent allo-HSCT. These patients were divided into two groups  by Ccr (ml/min) before transplantation; one showed normal renal function  (Ccr ≥ 60, n = 156) and the other showed mild renal dysfunction (30 ≤ Ccr < 60,  n = 29), and transplant outcomes were compared between the groups.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: GFR  was measured with iohexol clearance adjusted to 1.73 m(2). One population sample  (n=436/Lund) was used to derive an equation based on  plasma-creatinine/age/gender, and a second with the addition of lean body mass  (LBM). Both equations were validated in a separate sample (n=414/Malmö). The  coefficients of the equations were eventually fine-tuned using all 850 patients  and yielding Lund-Malmö equations without (LM) and with LBM-term (LM(LBM)). Their  performance was compared with the MDRD(CC) (conventional creatinine calibration),  MDRD(IDMS) (isotope dilution mass spectroscopy traceable calibration) and Mayo  Clinic equations. RESULTS: The Lund equations performed similarly in both  samples. In the combined set, the Mayo Clinic/MDRD(CC) resulted in +19.0/+10.2 %  median bias, while bias for the other equations was < 10 %. LM(LBM) had the  highest accuracy (86 % of estimates within 30 % of measured GFR), significantly  (p < 0.001) better than for MDRD(IDMS) (80 %). In men with BMI < 20 kg/m(2),  MDRD(IDMS)/LM had +46 %/+19 % median bias. MDRD(IDMS) also overestimated GFR by  22 %/14 % in men/women above 80 years of age.

Residual  creatinine clearance appears to be a crude index of the increasing severity of  multiple factors that may contribute to the anemia. CAPD appears to maintain or  improve hematocrit as renal mass and function decline.","1990","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","279-282","","4","10","","Perit Dial Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2096928","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Regression Analysis; *Hematocrit; Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism; Creatinine/*metabolism; *Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; Anemia/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It  has been reported that Ccr measurements can approximate true GFR after cimetidine  (Ci) administration. In this study, GFR was estimated by Cockcroft and Gault's  equation (C(C-G)) based on measurement of plasma creatinine, and Ccr was  determined by the standard clearance equation using 4- and 24-hr urine samples  (Ccr4 and Ccr24, respectively) in 17 patients and 10 healthy controls. After  cimetidine administration (800 mg, 3 times daily), GFR values were recalculated  at the same time periods (C(CiC-G), CcrCi4 and CcrCi24, respectively). The  results were all compared to those obtained by the 99mTc-DTPA protein-free  double-sample method (C(DTPA)), which is a reference method for GFR  determination. The coefficient of variation (CV%) for Ccr24/C(DTPA) was high  before cimetidine administration; Ccr24 and CcrCi24 values were significantly  different from C(DTPA) (CV 23.1%, Ccr24/C(DTPA) = 1.17, p 0.005; and CV 14.1%,  CcrCi24/C(DTPA) = 0.92, p 0.006, respectively). Ccr4 values obtained before  cimetidine ingestion showed large variation and were significantly different from  C(DTPA) (CV 15.5%, Ccr4/C(DTPA) = 1.11, p 0.001). CcrCi4 values after cimetidine  were similar to CDTPA (CV 6.9%, CcrCi4/C(DTPA) = 1.01, p 0.28). C(C-G) estimates  were higher before cimetidine intake (CV 12.4%, C(C-G)/C(DTPA) = 1.21, p <0.001),  whereas C(CiC-G) values were not significantly different from C(DTPA) values (CV  7.0%, C(CiC-G)/C(DTPA) = 1.01, p 0.67). This study shows that GFR estimations by  C(C-G), Ccr4, Ccr24, or CcrCi24 are insufficiently reliable.

METHODS: The patients  enrolled with the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay over 3 days were  collected from August 2010 to May 2011. According to the diagnosis of AKI during  the ICU stay, patients were divided into the AKI group (n=21) and non-AKI group  (n=30). After patients were admitted, the level of SCys C and creatinine (SCr)  were measured so as to count CCr based on SCys C (SCys C-CCr) or on SCr (SCr-CCr)  respectively, meanwhile urine volume and acute physiology and chronic health  evaluation II (APACHE II) score were monitored. The value of CCr counted by SCys  C and SCr on predict AKI and the correlations between RRT were compared. RESULTS:  SCr-CCr and SCys C-CCr in AKI group both were significantly lower than non-AKI  group all the way through on admission, and 2 days and 1 day before AKI diagnosed  and the day AKI diagnosed. The level of SCys C-CCr on 2 days prior to AKI  diagnosed was significantly lower than the day admitted (70.6±8.4 ml×min(-1)×1.73  m(-2) vs. 114.8±15.8 ml×min(-1)×1.73 m(-2), P<0.01), whereas the level of SCr-CCr  were not significantly changed (76.4±19.3 ml×min(-1)×1.73 m(-2) vs. 78.7±22.1  ml×min(-1)×1.73 m(-2), P>0.05). Receptor operative curve (ROC) analysis indicated  that SCys C-CCr could predict AKI earlier than SCr-CCr, as the area under curve  (AUC) of SCys C-CCr and SCr-CCr on 2 days prior to AKI diagnosed were 0.859 and  0.664, respectively, and the sensitivity were 90.5% and 47.6%, the specificity  were 76.2% and 81.0%. In AKI group 6 patients were treated with RRT, the AKI  patients receiving RRT had significantly higher APACHE II score on admission  (29.6±4.5 vs. 17.0±5.6, P<0.05) and less urine volume within 24 hours (740±465 ml  vs. 1780±1230 ml, P<0.05) than patients not received RRT, however, SCys C-CCr has  no significant difference between the sub-group (50.4±11.2 ml×min(-1)×1.73 m(-2)  vs. 53.0±8.4 ml×min(-1)×1.73 m(-2), P>0.05). SCys C-CCr did not predict the need  of RRT on the day to diagnose AKI (AUC=0.65). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of  SCys C-CCr were high, but its specificity not. The SCys C-CCr may be helpful for  excluding diagnose of AKI in high risk patients. However, it could not predict  the need for renal replacement therapy on the day AKI diagnosed.","2012-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","534-537","","9","24","","Zhongguo Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 22938661","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Retrospective Studies; APACHE; Acute Kidney Injury/*metabolism; Creatinine/*metabolism; Cystatin C/*blood; Renal Replacement Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrast dose and renal function have  been shown in most but not all studies to be risk factors for RCIN. We are  investigating the ratio of contrast dose to creatinine clearance (D/CrCL) as a  risk indicator. Theory shows that the D/CrCL ratio equals the area under the  concentration-time curve (AUC), an accepted measure of systemic exposure. This  study investigated the correlation between calculated D/CrCL and experimentally  measured AUC for the contrast agent iodixanol. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Experimental data on AUC from a phase 1 study of iodixanol were plotted against  the D/CrCL ratio and the degree of correlation was determined. RESULTS:  Experimentally determined AUC data correlate highly with the D/CrCL ratio.

However, concern has been raised about its long-term  impact. Hypercalciuria is a known adverse effect of treatment with systemic  corticosteroids. The urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (UCa:Cr) is a simple,  reliable and non-invasive tool for evaluation of hypercalciuria. AIM: To  determine whether ICS can induce hypercalciuria in children with asthma. SETTING:  Outpatient clinic in a referral hospital. METHODS: The UCa:Cr was determined in  25 children aged 3-6 years with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma before and  after a 2-month course of inhaled budesonide 400 micrograms/day via an  aerochamber. Children who had received oral corticosteroids, diuretics,  antibiotics or theophylline were excluded. STATISTICS: Paired Student's t-test  and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The mean UCa:Cr was similar in the children  with asthma before and after 2 months' administration of budesonide (0.10 +/-  0.10 and 0.11 +/- 0.08, respectively; p = 0.601). The numbers of hypercalciuric  children were two and five, respectively (p = 0.417). In 68% of patients, the  UCa:Cr increased and in 16% the increase indicated hypercalciuria (UCa:Cr > 0.2).  CONCLUSIONS: Although the treatment of childhood asthma with budesonide 400  micrograms/day via an aerochamber does not appear to be associated with  hypercalciuria, the existence of a subgroup of patients in whom ICS may induce  hypercalciuria is plausible. This needs to be further evaluated in a larger  study.","2003-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","313-316","","4","58","","Therapie","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 14679669","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Child; Child, Preschool; Administration, Inhalation; Creatinine/*urine; Calcium/*urine; Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Anti-Asthmatic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Asthma/complications/*urine; Budesonide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in Japan, Cin has not been officially  recognized by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan for clinical  use. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) has been used to estimate the renal function of  patients, but there have been many studies in which Ccr estimates were GFR  falsely high because the metabolism and tubular excretion of creatinine widely  varied according to the pathophysiological state of the patient. In the present  study, we determined Cin and Ccr simultaneously in 116 adult patients with renal  diseases and diabetic mellitus. The clearance study was performed by the modified  Wesson's method. The inulin preparation was FFI-1010 (Fuji Yakuhin Co. Ltd.).  Inulin in serum and urine was determined by the newly devised enzymatic assay  (Toyobo Co. Ltd.), which is specific for inulin. The mean Cin was 35.0 +/- 14.4  ml/min/1.73 m2. The mean Ccr(the enzyme assay) was 63.6 +/- 24.1 ml/min/1.73 m2  and that of the kinetic Jaffe assay was 55.3 +/- 19.3 ml/min/1.73 m2. Mean  Ccr/Cin was 1.93 +/- 0.73, 1.69 +/- 0.62, respectively. This ratio was  significantly different(p < 0.05) in the degree of reduction of Cin, with values  of 2.07 +/- 0.82 (Cin < 40 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 1.64 +/- 0.32(40 < Cin < 80  ml/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Only 8 patients were classified into the same  degree of reduced renal function (the Guideline of Japanese Society of  Nephrology). The findings of this study suggest that the GFR determined by Ccr  could misjudge the renal function of patient and delay the administration of  proper treatment of the patient. Introduction of Cin into the clinical field is  necessary to avoid this delay.","2005","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","804-812","","7","47","","Nihon Jinzo Gakkai Shi","","","","","","","","jpn","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 16296410","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Aged, 80 and over; Acute Disease; Chronic Disease; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Diabetes Mellitus/physiopathology; Biomarkers/urine; *Creatinine/urine; *Inulin/urine; Glomerulonephritis/*diagnosis/*physiopathology; Nephrotic Syndrome/diagnosis/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alternatively, Kt/V creatinine (Kt/V creat), which is  normalized to total body water (TBW) rather than BSA, could be a better dialytic  indicator. In this study, the efficiency of dialysis and the nutritional status  of pediatric patients on chronic PD were examined, and the utility of dialytic  indicators was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 49 patients under 20 years old,  in stable condition, and on PD were analyzed. Weekly total Kt/V of urea (Kt/V  urea), CCr, Kt/V creat, and normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance  (nPNA) were measured for all patients and for patients under 6 years old. The  target value was 2.0/week for Kt/V urea and 60 L/ week/1.73 m2 for CCr, as  recommended by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. The  target value for Kt/V creat was set as 1.52/week, using a male model with a  height of 170 cm and a body weight of 65 kg. RESULTS: The mean values of  delivered Kt/V urea, CCr, Kt/V creat, and nPNA (and proportion of patients that  achieved each target value) for all patients were 2.25 +/- 0.57/ week (67.4%),  53.8 +/- 19.3 L/week1/.73 m2 (26.5%), 1.83 +/- 0.73/ week (65.3%), and 1.11 +/-  0.42 g/day, respectively.

Stepwise multiple regression  analyses revealed that the relationship between CCr and Kt/V urea was affected by  the patient's age. CONCLUSIONS: Our pediatric patients achieved the recommended  target value of Kt/V urea. At the same time, the nPNA results reflected the  patient's status well. However, CCr appeared to be inappropriate as an indicator  for patients under 6 years old.

Two multicentre trials performed in the  U.S. (PPDSC) and Europe (MEPPS) have established reference curves for solute  equilibration in children performed with the use of 1100 ml/m2 fill volume in the  former and 1000 ml/m2 in the latter study. AIM OF THE STUDY: Assessment of basal  peritoneal membrane equilibration based on PET tests in polish children and  adolescents treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 58  PET tests from patients treated at 8 Polish PD centres were analysed. The mean  time of performing PET test was 6,5 months after the start of PD therapy. All of  the patients had been peritonitis free from onset. The mean fill volume was 1021  (906-1170) ml/m2. RESULTS: Based on the results of creatinine and glucose  equilibration we established basal peritoneal solute transport curves for polish  PD children using an average fill volume of 1020 ml/m2. The following values were  obtained at 4hrs of dwell time for 2.27% glucose solution: D/P for creatinine =  0.68 +/- 0.15 and D/Do for glucose = 0.39 +/- 0.12. CONCLUSIONS: The DIP  creatinine equilibration curves were similar to the previously published  reference curves for children, whereas those for glucose was significantly lower.  Using a fill volume scaled to body surface area of 1020 ml/m2 equilibration  curves for glucose and creatinine are similar in children over 1 year of age and  adults.","2006","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","75-77","","","63 Suppl 3","","Przegl Lek","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 16898494","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Permeability; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Retrospective Studies; Poland; Glucose/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/*blood; *Peritoneal Dialysis; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it causes systematic overdosing when the creatinine  levels are measured by an enzymatic peroxidase-antiperoxidase method (PAP-Cr). We  previously suggested an amended dosing formula to adjust this overdosing:  carboplatin dose (mg) = AUC (mg ml(-1) min) x [adjusted Ccr (ml min(-1)) + 25],  where the Ccr was adjusted by adding 0.2 (mg dl(-1)) to serum PAP-Cr. In this  study, we prospectively validated this formula in 55 patients from six  institutions. Target AUC ranged from 3 to 7 mg ml(-1) min, and Ccr was measured  by 24-h urine collection. Estimation of carboplatin clearance with the amended  formula was unbiased [mean prediction error (MPE) +/- SE = 2.9 +/- 3.4%] and  acceptably precise [root mean squared error, (RMSE) = 24.7%], whereas the Calvert  formula using non-adjusted Ccr overpredicted carboplatin clearance systematically  (MPE +/- SE = 24.9 +/- 4.9% and RMSE = 36.1%). The improvement in the bias and  precision of the estimation was seen in all of the participating institutions as  shown by decrease in the absolute value of MPE and RMSE for each institution. The  Chatelut formula also highly overestimated carboplatin clearance when PAP-Cr was  used, but the adjustment of PAP-Cr yielded a decrease in MPE by 30.4% and in RMSE  by 21.3%. These results confirmed the necessity of adjusting the serum PAP-Cr in  carboplatin dosing formulas.","2000-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","4733-4738","","12","6","","Clin Cancer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11156227","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Area Under Curve; Aged, 80 and over; Bias; Peroxidase/blood; Creatinine/*blood/*urine; Carboplatin/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Neoplasms/*blood/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study  compares the precision of estimating GFR as ClK and ClA/B. A multiple  plasma-sample standard method (ClSM) served as reference. The comparison was  performed in 136 individuals. The variance of ClA/B on ClSM was 14.4 ml/min/1.73  m2 while the variance of ClK on ClSM was 204.5 ml/min/1.73 m2. It is concluded  that the ClA/B values are more precise than the ClK values (p less than 0.01).  The single-sample method for determination of 51Cr-EDTA clearance seems  well-suited for evaluation and monitoring of patients with known or suspected  kidney diseases.

J.","Calculation of 6-hour D/P creatinine ratio from the 4-hour peritoneal equilibration test. The effect of dwell duration on the results.","Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis","","0896-8608","","","OBJECTIVES: Since the introduction of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), the 4-hour dialysate/plasma creatinine (D/P Cr) has been used by several authors  for determining continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) prescriptions.  However, the results have been unsatisfactory because the 4-hr D/P Cr does not  accurately reflect the D/P Cr in 24-hr collections. The PET and the 24-hr  dialysate collections differ in the duration of dwell and the tonicity and volume  of dialysate, all of which influence the equilibrated D/P Cr. It can be assumed  that the D/P Cr in 24-hr collections in these patients is closer to a 6-hr D/P  Cr. Because a 6-hr PET is inconvenient, we developed a mathematical model to  calculate the 5- and 6-hr D/P using the results of a standard PET. DESIGN: In a  retrospective analysis, D/P Cr ratios in 24-hr collections and D/P Cr ratios  calculated from a mathematical formula were correlated. Using a mathematical  model, the data collected fit an exponential relation of the type D/P =  a(1-e-t/tau). The values of a and tau are unique for a given patient and were  determined using a nonlinear regression technique. The formula performed well on  our published data-the true and predicted 6-hr D/P Cr being 0.696 and 0.71,  respectively. SETTING: The University Hospital and Clinics, Dalton Cardiovascular  Research Center and Dialysis Clinic, Inc., Columbia, Missouri. PATIENTS: All CAPD  patients on four 2-L exchanges/day at the time of the 24-hr collections were  included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Closeness of 4-hr and 6-hr  D/P Cr values to those of 24-hr ratios. RESULTS: The study group comprised 74  patients (age, mean +/- SEM: 56.4 +/- 1.8 yr) with 80 PETs and 145 (24-hr)  collections. The interval between the two tests was 8.3 +/- 0.9 months (0-48.7  months). The median 24-hr D/P Cr of 0.760 did not differ significantly from the  predicted median 6-hr D/P Cr of 0.755. A subgroup analysis, based on transport  type, showed that this relationship was most precise in the high-average  transporters. The predicted 6-hr D/P Cr was within 10% of the 24-hr D/P Cr in 48%  of patients and within 20% in 77% of patients. The margin of error was greatest  in the low transporters. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, the 4-hr D/P Cr from a PET  cannot be used interchangeably with the D/P Cr in the 24-hr dialysate  collections, hence, the clearances calculated thereof will be inaccurate. Using  the proposed model, it is feasible to use the 4-hr PET results to obtain 5- and  6-hr D/P Cr values. In our study, using this model, the extrapolated 6-hr D/P Cr  is similar to the D/P Cr in 24-hr dialysate collections only in the high-average  transporters. Hence, the best way to determine clearances in peritoneal dialysis  patients is still by collecting 24-hr dialysates.","1997-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","273-278","","3","17","","Perit Dial Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9237289","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Models, Biological; Biological Transport, Active; Aged, 80 and over; Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology; Hypertension/complications; Models, Theoretical; Creatinine/*blood; Peritoneum/*metabolism; *Reproducibility of Results; Diabetic Nephropathies/complications; Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*methods; Dialysis Solutions/analysis/*metabolism; Kidney Failure, Chronic/etiology/physiopathology; Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory/methods/standards; Polycystic Kidney Diseases/complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, pharmacokinetic modeling of an exogenous plasma creatinine  clearance could be useful for assessing renal creatinine excretion in birds. For  this study, creatinine (50 mg/kg) was administered to 2 groups of 15 pigeons  (Columba livia) each; in one group by the intravenous (IV) route and in the  second by the intramuscular (IM) route. The time series of the plasma creatinine  concentrations were analyzed by pharmacokinetic models. Body mass-specific  creatinine excretion was determined for IV and IM administration to be between  6.30 and 6.44 mL/min per kg, respectively. Body surface area-specific creatinine  clearance, which is related to the metabolic rate, was calculated between 0.506  and 0.523 mL/min per dm2, respectively. The results showed that IV as well as IM  administration can be used for assessing renal creatinine excretion in pigeons.  For practical reasons, IM administration is recommended, with the use of the  Bateman function to calculate creatinine elimination.","2013-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","173-179","","3","27","","J Avian Med Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24344507","","","","Animals; Area Under Curve; Injections, Intravenous; Injections, Intramuscular; Kidney/*physiology; Columbidae/*blood; Creatinine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Cockcroft-Gault normalized to 72 kg and the  Hull equations are among the simplest to calculate and, when using a minimum  serum creatinine of 71 mumol/L, had significantly greater precision and less bias  than several of the equations.

Twenty-eight patients required hemodialysis after HSCT, with 5.5, 5.4,  and 9.1 % in groups 0, 1, and 2, respectively (p = 0.65). The incidence of  non-relapse mortality (NRM) was higher in group 2, although these differences  were not statistically significant probably due to the small sample size (23.7,  28.2, and 47.2 % at 3 years, p = 0.20). In conclusion, NRM may be associated with  mildly reduced renal function before allogeneic HSCT, which cannot be detected by  measurement of the serum creatinine level alone.","2013-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","255-260","","2","92","","Ann Hematol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 23053182","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Treatment Outcome; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Young Adult; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Comorbidity; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Transplantation, Homologous; Kidney/*physiopathology; Kidney Transplantation; Creatinine/*blood; *Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects; Anemia, Aplastic/blood/surgery; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Graft vs Host Disease/blood/etiology/prevention & control; Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/surgery; Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Renal Insufficiency/blood/*etiology/physiopathology/surgery/therapy; Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking advantage of the  fact that amylase is filtered in the glomerulus and reabsorbed by the proximal  tubules, we prospectively examined in 23 patients if changes in renal amylase  creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR) can predict gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Eighteen  of these patients had an initial creatinine clearance (rCcr) above 30 mL/min.  Eleven of them (group A) had an ACCR above 3.5% (control 3% +/- 1.03%) and all  exhibited an average reduction of 32.2% +/- 11.6% in rCcr following one week of  gentamicin therapy. In contrast, only one of seven patients (group B) with an  initial ACCR below 3.5% had a reduction, albeit transient, in rCcr. During  gentamicin therapy, group A patients had a further increase in ACCR which was  proportional to the reduction observed in rCcr (r = -.54). Our preliminary data  suggest that ACCR may prove a simple and possibly a reliable predictor of kidney  function deterioration during gentamicin therapy in patients with rCcr above 30  mL/min: patients with pretherapy ACCR above 3.5% may exhibit a deterioration in  the creatinine clearance during the first week of therapy. For patients with  pretherapy renal failure (rCcr less than 30 mL/min) the creatinine levels (but  not the ACCR) seem to retain their significance in predicting and monitoring  further renal function deterioration during aminoglycoside therapy.","1988-05","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1093-1096","","5","148","","Arch Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2452611","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Prospective Studies; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Aged, 80 and over; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Creatinine/*metabolism; Amylases/*metabolism; Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced/*diagnosis/metabolism; Gentamicins/*adverse effects; Kidney/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This spurious value was ""unmasked"" by the use of an enzymatic  method to measure the serum creatinine level. A high serum creatinine value  disproportionate to the level of BUN and recent skin exposure to nitromethane  were the clinical indications that suggested the differentiation of massive  rhabdomyolysis from spurious hypercreatinemia.

Standardization to body surface  area or lean body weight or stratification by patient factors (gender, disease  stage, risk factors, drug treatment) did not improve correlations. However,  patients with normal microalbumin excretion rates had more predictable CCR values  compared with those who had excess excretion, suggesting the influence of  HIV-associated nephropathy on CCR estimation. Since all predicted CCR equations  consistently underestimated actual values, these equations should be used with  caution in estimating measured CCR in HIV-seropositive patients.","1992-10","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","394-399","","10","30","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 1446956","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Mathematics; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics; HIV Infections/metabolism; HIV Seropositivity/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients were in intensive care units for management of acute  exacerbations of sepsis, pneumonia, or abscess; most had other complicating  conditions and were chronically ill. Urine was collected for 8 to 24 hours (70%  for 24 hours) from Foley-catheterized patients. Patients were divided into low  (less than 15 mg/kg/day), normal (15-25 mg/kg/day), and elevated (greater than 25  mg/kg/day) urinary creatinine excretion groups. Actual body weight (ABW) was used  in some patient subgroups to explore differences between using IBW and ABW. SNN  most accurately predicted Clcr in the 20% of the urine collections characterized  by normal urinary creatinine excretion (Ucr). Most study patients excreted  significantly less creatinine than the age-matched population tested in  developing the SNN. In acutely ill patients with low Ucr, SNN overpredicted Clcr  by 10-20 ml/min. SNN also overpredicted Clcr values in obese patients, but use of  IBW rather than ABW improved the correlation between measured and predicted  values in this subgroup. The SNN nomogram is applicable to critically ill  patients if adjustments are made in predicted values. The characteristics of  patients with low Ucr and the mechanism responsible for the decreased Ucr deserve  further study.","1981-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","837-840","","6","38","","Am J Hosp Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7246554","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Body Weight; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Acute Disease; Creatinine/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The maximal serum creatinine (Cr) level for  MELD is set at 4.0 mg/dL; however, there was no outcome data to justify this  strategy. METHODS: Ninety-two patients with cirrhosis with Cr level >4 mg/dL were  selected from 1438 patients and compared with MELD score-matched controls for  three-month and six-month mortality. RESULTS: At three months, patients with Cr  level >4 mg/dL had a significantly higher mortality rate than the 184 controls  with a lower Cr level (44.6% vs. 29.3%, p = 0.015). This trend was still  significant at six months: the mortality rate was 62% in the index group vs.  45.1% in the control group (p = 0.011). The difference between the index and  control groups was the smallest (2.5% at three months and 3.4% at six months)  when Cr was up-scaled to 5.5 mg/dL. The predictive accuracy of the MELD was  estimated by using area under receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) curve. Only  the cutoff of 5.5 mg/dL at six months displayed a higher AUC (0.753).  CONCLUSIONS: A cutoff at 5.5 mg/dL may be more appropriate for the MELD. The MELD  for patients with cirrhosis with advanced renal insufficiency deserves  re-evaluation.","2010-04","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","157-163","","2","24","","Clin Transplant","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Denmark PMID: 19807746","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Area Under Curve; ROC Curve; *Liver Transplantation; Severity of Illness Index; International Normalized Ratio; *Tissue and Organ Procurement; Creatinine/*blood; Liver Cirrhosis/blood/surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Japanese journal of clinical pathology","","0047-1860","","","Estimation of Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is crucial for the detection of renal insufficiency. In clinical practice, GFR is generally estimated from Ccr by  some prediction formulas including the serum creatinine concentration and some  variables: age, sex, body size. It has been suggested that serum cystatin C is  less influenced by sex, body size, muscular mass or inflammation. In several  studies, serum cystatin C performed better than serum creatinine did as a marker  to detect GFR reduction. We developed the formula for predicting creatinine  clearance (Ccr) from serum cystatin C, serum creatinine and serum beta  2-microgroburin by multiple regression analysis. In this study, we analysed  24-hour Ccr and variables (sex, age and BMI) in 82 subjects with renal diseases  to develop suitable formulas. Our serum cystatin C formula is as follows: Ccr  (ml/min/1.73m2) = (12.14-0.03 x age-1.72 x serum cystatin C) 2. Correlation  between measured 24-hour Ccr and predicted Ccr by our serum cystatin C formula  was higher (r=0.852) than our serum creatinine formula (r=0.755), serum beta  2-microgroburin formula (r=0.793), Cockcroft-Gault formula (r=0.836) and Horio  formula (r=0.825). Accuracy within 15% was higher (39.0%) than other formulas  (25.6-30.5%). Our formula using serum cystatin C for predicting Ccr is a useful  and precise marker for Ccr than other commonly used formulas using serum  creatinine.","2008-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","1093-1099","","12","56","","Rinsho Byori","","","","","","","","jpn","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 19175073","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Regression Analysis; Biomarkers/blood; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Metabolic Clearance Rate; Cystatin C/*blood; *Creatinine; beta 2-Microglobulin/blood; Renal Insufficiency/*diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The urinary  concentration of creatinine can be divided into two broad groups depending on the  GFR. The boundary of this division is around 60 ml per min. This suggests that  when GFR is depressed there would exist a limitation of the tubular secretion of  creatinine or urinary dilution problems.

Measured Ccr values were calculated from 24-hour urinary catheter  collections. Steady state Scr values were obtained during the same collection  interval. Predicted Ccr values were derived from Scr using the methods of  Cockcroft and Gault (Method II), Siersbaek-Nielsen, Kampmann and others (Method  III) and Jeliffe (Methods I and IV). Wide differences between measured and  predicted values were observed but were statistically significant (p less than  0.05) for Method I only. The smallest mean difference (+/-0.02 ml/min/1.73 m2)  occurred with Method II measured-predicted data pairs. Method III predicted Ccr  values which correlated best with measured values (r=0.770) and showed the least  variability (+/-7.6 ml/min/1.73 m2). All methods appeared to overestimate when  measured Ccr was less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Use of estimated lean body weights  did not improve correlations between predicted and measured Ccr values. While  Methods II and III may provide useful initial approximations of Ccr in burn  patients, reliance upon predicted Ccr values for dosage modification in burn  patients may result in an insufficient reduction in dosage. Whenever possible,  dosage regimens for drugs with narrow therapeutic margins should be developed or  adjusted using pharmacokinetic values determined in the individual patient.","1978-06","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","717-720","","6","35","","Am J Hosp Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 665687","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Models, Biological; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Methods; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Creatine/*metabolism; Burns/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endogenous creatinine clearance, 1.97  +/- 0.09 ml/min/kg, underestimated inulin clearance (P less than 0.01), probably  because of the presence of noncreatinine chromogens in caprine plasma.

In 6 anesthetized goats, exogenous creatinine clearance and SS  clearance exceeded inulin clearance (P less than 0.05).

Increased amylase--to--creatinine clearance  ratios (ACCR), suggesting pancreatic dysfunction, have been reported in patients  following nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pulsatile CPB is  increasingly recognized to be a more physiological form of perfusion,  particularly with respect to capillary blood flow. In this study the ACCR has  been determined before, during, and after cardiac operations performed with both  nonpulsatile and pulsatile CPB. Twenty patients undergoing elective cardiac  operations were studied. Ten patients had nonpulsatile CPB (nonpulsatile group)  and 10 had pulsatile CPB (pulsatile group). The two groups were comparable as  regards perioperative variables and perfusion parameters. In both groups the ACCR  was estimated preoperatively, on three occasions during the operation, and daily  on the first 5 postoperative days. A significant elevation in ACCR was observed  in nine of 10 patients in the nonpulsatile group but in only one of 10 patients  in the pulsatile group (p less than 0.001). The significant improvement of ACCR  stability following pulsatile CPB may indicate that this form of perfusion will  reduce the risk of pancreatitis following cardiac operations performed with CPB.","1981-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","248-253","","2","82","","J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6166815","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Creatinine/*metabolism; Amylases/*metabolism; Cardiopulmonary Bypass/adverse effects/*methods; Pancreatitis/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An acute protein load has been  reported to increase creatinine clearance; however this alteration in function is  variable. Therefore, the route of administration of a protein load was examined  in this study while the dietary protein was controlled. Sequentially, both oral  and intravenous protein loads were administered to the same volunteer while  initially on a low protein diet (0.75 g/kg/24h) for three weeks followed by three  weeks of an ad libitum protein diet (1.31 g/kg/24h). Neither the baseline serum  creatinine nor the creatinine clearance were altered by the diet. Only the oral  protein load resulted in an increase in the creatinine clearance.

The ability of this method to achieve therapeutic plasma aminoglycoside  concentrations early in the course of treatment was compared with that of a  nomogram approach based on creatinine clearance estimated using the formula of  Cockroft and Gault. Ninety-two percent of patients in the computer group achieved  peak plasma concentrations within the optimum range of 6-10 mg/l at 48-72 h  compared with 21% of control group patients (p = 0.0009). The mean peak plasma  concentration of 7.45 mg/l at 48-72 h in the computer group was closer to the  target concentration of 8 mg/l than was the 5.14 mg/l in the control group (p =  0.0004). There was no significant difference between the groups in measured  indices of renal function, both groups showing an improvement in mean estimated  creatinine clearance from the beginning to the end of the course of treatment.  Dosing based on individualised pharmacokinetic data is therefore a more reliable  method of achieving therapeutic blood concentrations early in the course of  treatment than is nomogram based dosing. Other studies suggest that this should  be associated with a reduction in mortality in severe infections.","1989","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","233-237","","4","15","","Intensive Care Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2745867","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Prospective Studies; Random Allocation; Creatinine/pharmacokinetics/*urine; Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Infections/*drug therapy/mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The age of the patients ranged from two month to  fourteen years. DMSA renal uptake was measured 7 hours after injection and was  normalized in percent of the injected activity. A significant correlation was  found between creatinine clearance and DMSA uptake (Pearson's r = 0.866, p less  than 0.01). Normal creatinine clearance in children (80 to 120 ml/min-1 X 1.73  m-2) allowed determination of normal renal uptake (36 to 60%). This study  indicates that in cases of asymmetrical renal impairment renal uptake reflects  split renal creatinine clearance. Since the former is much easier to measure,  DMSA should play an important role in the evaluation of differential renal  function.","1986","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","143-145","","4","7","","Nephrologie","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 3025756","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Regression Analysis; Child, Preschool; Infant; Creatinine/urine; Nephrectomy; Radionuclide Imaging; *Technetium; Technetium Tc 99m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid; *Succimer; *Sulfhydryl Compounds; Kidney/abnormalities/*diagnostic imaging/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum cystatin C (sCysC) is a novel  marker in predicting the CKD. We therefore compare sCysC and serum creatinine  (sCr) with the aim of improving the detection of CKD in renal transplant  recipients. METHODS: We enrolled 106 renal transplant recipients and estimated  glomerular filtration rates (GFR) using the Cockcroft-Gault (GFR(CG)) and the  abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (GFR(aMDRD)) formulae. We  defined CKD as the presence of structural or functional kidney damage,  irrespective of the diagnosis. Comparisons of sCysC and sCr in detecting CKD were  analyzed. RESULTS: sCysC correlates with sCr significantly (r = 0.87; P < .001).  The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrates that sCysC has a better  specificity and area under the curve, but less sensitivity than sCr in predicting  CKD in renal transplant recipients if GFR is estimated by GFR(CG). Additionally,  if GFR was estimated by GFR(aMDRD), the role of sCysC or sCr in prediction of CKD  was comparable.

In patients with creatinine in the upper normal level,  cystatin C might be a more sensitive predictor of CIN than creatinine. Therefore,  in this study, we investigated the usefulness of cystatin C to predict CIN.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 400 consecutive patients with creatinine baseline levels  between 0.8 and 1.3 mg/dL undergoing coronary angiography (n = 200) or CT (n =  200), baseline values of cystatin C, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and  risk factors of CIN were determined. Creatinine was also assessed 24 and 48 hours  after contrast administration. RESULTS: Creatinine significantly (p < 0.001)  increased after 24 hours and 48 hours compared with baseline (1.06 ± 0.28 and  1.07 ± 0.28 vs 0.99 ± 0.18 mg/dL). Fifty-three of 373 evaluable patients (14.2%)  had an increase in creatinine of ≥ 25% or ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 48 hours. CIN  according to this definition was significantly more frequent after intraarterial  contrast administration (38/190, 20%) compared with IV contrast administration  (15/183, 8.2%; p = 0.001). CIN was predicted by baseline cystatin C (area under  the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC], 0.715; p < 0.001),  whereas creatinine, creatinine clearance, and BUN were not predictive. The best  predictive capabilities were provided by cystatin C/creatinine-ratio (AUC, 0.826;  p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that intraarterial contrast  administration (p = 0.002) and higher baseline cystatin C (p < 0.001) combined  with low creatinine (p = 0.044) were independently associated with higher  increases in creatinine within 48 hours after contrast administration.  CONCLUSION: CIN in patients with creatinine within the upper normal range is  significantly more frequent after intraarterial than after IV contrast  administration. In these patients, renal impairment after contrast administration  is independently predicted by cystatin C and cystatin C/creatinine-ratio, whereas  BUN and creatinine were not predictive.","2014-02","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","452-458","","2","202","","AJR Am J Roentgenol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24450691","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Area Under Curve; Coronary Angiography; Blood Urea Nitrogen; Creatinine/*blood; Cystatin C/*blood; Contrast Media/*adverse effects; Kidney Diseases/*blood/*chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We measured the serum  concentrations of ABK, using fluorescence polarization immunoassay, in 10  critically ill patients (patient group) and six healthy volunteers (control  group). Data were analysed with a two-compartment model and parameters were  estimated by the Bayesian method. The Mann-Whitney U-test or chi-squared test was  used as appropriate (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Creatinine clearance (CCR), measured or  estimated using Cockcroft and Gault's formula of the patient group (CCR: 58 +/-  13 mL/min), was significantly lower than that of the control group (CCR: 99 +/- 8  mL/min). However, despite the low CCR, even the maintenance ABK dosage for normal  CCR did not elevate the highest serum level (C(max)) to the effective range in  the patient group. Although the ABK clearance (CL) did not differ between the  groups, the patients' distribution volume (V(d)) increased significantly compared  with the control. The transfer rate constant from central to peripheral  compartment (k(12)) in the patient group was much higher than that in the  control. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with lowered CCR, the ABK dose  for normal CCR subjects does not elevate its serum concentration to effective  levels because of augmented V(d) caused by increased k(12). The present results  hypothesize that adjustment of antibiotic dosing according to CCR further lowers  C(max) in critically ill patients with reduced CCR.","2008-10","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","521-527","","5","33","","J Clin Pharm Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18834367","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Tissue Distribution; Bayes Theorem; Aged, 80 and over; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay; Critical Illness; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Creatinine/blood/urine; Acute Kidney Injury/complications/*physiopathology; Dibekacin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/*drug effects; Staphylococcal Infections/*drug therapy/microbiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proteinuria was assessed by 24-hour urine  protein excretion and protein-to-creatinine ratio. Correlation and limits of  agreement between the 2 methods were evaluated. The discriminant cutoff values  for spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio in predicting 24-hour urine protein  excretion were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves.

In approximately 20% of cases, these events necessitate hospitalization. By taking  into account the physiological changes associated with aging when prescribing  drugs, physicians can prevent some of these events. The objective of this study  was to analyze the prescriptions written by general practitioners for elderly  patients admitted to the emergency department in relation to the patient's  creatinine clearance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 968 consecutive patients older  than 70 years, 419 underwent a plasma creatinine assay on admission and were  included in this study. Creatinine clearance was calculated with Cockcroft's  formula. The patients were classified into two groups according to creatinine  clearance:<30 mL/min (group I) and >or=30 mL/min (group II). RESULTS: Creatinine  clearance was<30 mL/min in 84 of the 419 patients (group I) and >or=30 mL/min in  335 (group II). Mean age was significantly higher in group I than in group II (87  +/- 6 vs 81 +/- 6 years, p<0.001), as was mean plasma creatinine concentration  (113 +/- 23 vs 83 +/- 19 mmol/L, p<0.001), while mean weight was significantly  lower (57 +/- 10 vs 69 +/- 13 kg, p<0.001. In group I, 82 drugs with precautions  concerning renal function had been prescribed for 69 (82%) patients, and in group  II, 331 such drugs for 174 (52%) patients. Of the 82 drugs prescribed in group I  that required precaution, 47 (57%) were contraindicated or prescribed at an  inappropriate dose in view of the creatinine clearance. Irrespective of  pharmacokinetic parameters, the mean number of drugs taken per patient was 5 +/-  2 in group I and 6 +/-2 in group II. CONCLUSION: In prescribing drugs for elderly  patients, especially those whose weight is low, careful attention should be paid  to renal function.","2006-03","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","413-417","","3 Pt 1","35","","Presse Med","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 16550131","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Body Weight; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Kidney/drug effects/physiology; Creatinine/*metabolism; Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data; Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When measured using an injection technique in elderly former kidney donors, the  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was found to be markedly decreased. The aim of  this study was to determine the relationship between GFR and age in a cohort of  elderly controls with two kidneys. We were also interested to find out whether  GFR estimated using different equations correlated with the exact measurements.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: Renal function was determined using the iohexol technique  in 52 elderly ""healthy"" persons aged 70-110 years. Blood tests were done at the  same time. Estimated clearance was determined using the equations of  Cockroft-Gault, Walser and Levey. RESULTS: GFR showed a strong correlation with  age (p = 0.0002), with an annual decline of 1.05 ml/min. Using formulas for  estimation of clearance, the best correlation was found with that of Levey.  Probably the most widely-used formula, that of Cockroft-Gault, underestimated the  clearance, the mean value being 46.2 +/- 11.3 ml/min/1.73 m2, compared to the  measured mean value of 67.7 +/- 10.8 ml/min/1.73 m2. Serum (s)-creatinine did not  correlate with age (p = 0.3997). However, s-urea increased with age (p = 0.0019),  while s-albumin (p = 0.0018), blood haemoglobin (p = 0.0060) and s-ferritin (p =  0.0243) decreased with age. A total of 21/52 (30%) of the elderly subjects had a  GFR >70 ml/min/1.73 m2, but none of these persons was aged >90 years. Of the 21  subjects with good function, eight seemed to be quite healthy, with normal test  values. CONCLUSION: GFR decreases by approximately 1.05 ml/min per year in very  old persons. S-urea seems to be more sensitive than s-creatinine for indicating  renal function in the elderly. The best formula for estimation of clearance is  that of Levey. The Cockroft-Gault formula seems to underestimate GFR.","2004","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","73-77","","1","38","","Scand J Urol Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15204431","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Reference Values; Aged; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Sensitivity and Specificity; Aging/*physiology; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Geriatric Assessment; Tissue Donors; Kidney Transplantation; Creatinine/*blood; Kidney Function Tests/*methods; Iohexol/*pharmacokinetics; *Blood Urea Nitrogen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morbidly obese patients are increasing in  prevalence, and represent a population that can have augmented renal function  requiring higher-than-standard doses. OBJECTIVE: The current investigation was  performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and evaluate the influence of  alternate body size descriptors and renal function as predictors of levofloxacin  clearance (CL) and the area under the curve over 24 h (AUC24). METHODS: A  database of patients undergoing levofloxacin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)  were queried to identify patients ≥18 years of age with a body mass index  ≥40 kg/m(2). A maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian approach using a  two-compartment linear PK model was used to estimate individual PK parameters and  AUC24. RESULTS: A total of 394 concentration-time data points (peaks and trough)  from 68 patients between 98 and 250 kg were evaluated. The median (5th, 95th  percentile) daily dose and AUC24 was 1,000 (250, 1,500) mg and 90.7 (44.4, 228)  mg·h/L, respectively. Levofloxacin CL was significantly (p < 0.05) related to  height but not weight. As a result, levofloxacin CL was best related (R  (2) = 0.57) to creatinine CL (CLcr) estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault (CG)  equation and ideal body weight (IBW) because IBW is a height transformation. An  empiric four-category daily-dose regimen (500, 750, 1,000, 1,250 mg) stratified  by CLcr (CG-IBW) is expected to have >90 % probability of achieving an AUC24 of  50-150 mg·h/L in morbidly obese patients. Subsequent application of TDM and  integration with pathogen-specific information could then be applied to tailor  the levofloxacin regimen.

DESIGN: Single-center  cross-sectional study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 151 unselected CAPD  patients (78 males, 73 females). We calculated LBM-CK and LBM-AM using standard  formulas. The results of the two methods were then compared by the Bland and  Altman method. Dialysis adequacy and other nutritional indices, including total  Kt/V, weekly creatinine clearance (CCr), residual glomerular filtration rate  (GFR), protein nitrogen appearance (PNA), subjective global assessment (SGA), and  serum albumin, were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: The mean age of the  patients was 55.6 +/- 12.2 years, and the mean duration of dialysis was 33.6 +/-  28.5 months. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 22.7 +/- 3.7. The average LBM-AM  was 43.6 +/- 8.0 kg; the average LBM-CK was 33.0 +/- 9.3 kg. The difference  between the calculated LBM-AM and LBM-CK was 10.7 kg, with LBM-AM always giving a  higher value; the limits of agreement were -5.8 kg and 27.1 kg. The difference  between the two measures correlated with residual GFR (Pearson r = 0.629, p <  0.001). After normalizing for desired body weight, LBM-AM was only modestly  correlated with serum albumin level. No correlations were found between overall  SGA score or normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) and LBM-AM or LBM-CK.  CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese patients at least, a substantial discrepancy exists  between LBM-AM and LBM-CK. The difference is especially marked in patients with  significant residual renal function. The optimal method for determining LBM  remains obscure in Chinese CAPD patients. Moreover, LBM correlated poorly with  other nutritional indices.

Its levels are not  influenced by inflammation, infections, hepatic or renal diseases, or by dietary  or constitutional factors. We compared serum cystatin C and serum creatinine  based predicting equations to estimate glomerular filteration rate (GFR) in type  2 diabetes mellitus, using the staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined by  the National Kidney Foundation. We also explored the relationship of urine  albumin, GFR, serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations. METHODS: : A  cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi.  Consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus above the age of 35 years were  enrolled. Fasting and 2-hour-postprandial blood glucose, fasting lipid profile,  lipoprotein(a), haemoglobin, microalbuminuria, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c),  liver and renal function tests were assessed. Serum levels of Cystatin C were  measured using immune-turbidometric method (Dade Behring analyzer BN2). Estimated  GFR (eGFR) was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula, Modification of Diet in  Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Cys C  formula. The three sets of eGFR were compared using repeated measure ANOVA.  Linear regression analysis was performed to find the factor that affects the  albumin excretion rate (AER) and e-GFR levels using all three equations. RESULTS:  We assessed 172 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mean age of the patients  was 61.4 ± 9.6 years with mean duration of diabetes of 11.40 ± 7.5 years.  Approximately 70% of patients had hypertension. A family history of diabetes was  present in 53.4% of subjects and a history of CAD in first degree relatives in  20.9%. The prevalence of coronary artery disease was 17.4%. Albumin excretion  correlated with e-GFR estimated using each of the three equations. The best  correlation was seen with the CKD-EPI equation derived e-GFR. The CKD-EPI  equation also identified the maximum number of patients in the normo-albuminuria  group as having CKD.

Renal replacement therapy may be  provided by peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or renal transplantation. Among the  key indicators for tracking patients' current status are urea and creatinine  levels. AIM: The study analyzed saliva as a medium to detect and measure urea and  creatinine levels in end-stage CKD patients as well as to use it as criteria for  the effectiveness of the dialysis treatment by comparing salivary urea and  creatinine levels with their blood levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study  targeted 70 end-stage CKD patients from northeastern Bulgaria undergoing  hemodialysis treatment. The urea in blood serum was carried out using the UV  kinetic method. Creatinine levels were measured using Jaffe reaction colorimetric  method without deproteinezation, adapted on an Olympus AU 400 automated  biochemical analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA). Samples from whole unstimulated  saliva were collected in a 15 ml sterile test tube as per Navazesh method. The  qualitative determination of salivary urea was performed using the UV kinetic  method. Creatinine levels in whole unstimulated saliva were measured using Jaffe  reaction colorimetric method. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant  reduction in blood urea levels (P=0.000) and in blood creatinine levels (P =  0.000) following hemodialysis. The results revealed that there was no  statistically significant dependence between both, the urea levels (P=0.240) and  the creatinine levels (P=0.065) in whole unstimulated saliva obtained prior to  and after a hemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the parallel increase of the urea  and creatinine levels in blood serum and in whole unstimulated saliva in  end-stage CKD, salivary urea and creatinine levels could not be used as  diagnostic biomarkers for the effectiveness of dialysis treatment.","2018-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","2018-vol6","","6","35","","G Ital Nefrol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright by Società Italiana di Nefrologia SIN, Rome, Italy.","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 30550042","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Area Under Curve; Aged, 80 and over; Saliva/*chemistry; Sensitivity and Specificity; ROC Curve; *Renal Dialysis; Biomarkers/analysis; Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism/*therapy; Creatinine/*analysis/blood; dialysis; end-stage chronic kidney disease; salivary creatinine; salivary urea; Urea/*analysis/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  influence of age and body mass index (BMI) on the performance of these equations  was analyzed in 850 subjects with serum creatinine levels less than 1.5 mg/dL  (<133 micromol/L). METHODS: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as  urinary clearance of continuously infused technetium Tc 99m-labeled diethylene  triaminopentaacetic acid. Performance was assessed as bias, precision, and  accuracy. RESULTS: In the total population, the CG and MDRD calculations based on  enzymatic measurement of serum creatinine (which is constantly less than that  obtained by using the alkaline picrate [Jaffé] method) significantly  underestimated GFR by 4.9 and 12.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.08 and 0.21 mL/s/1.73 m2),  respectively. In patients 65 years and older, underestimation by means of the CG  formula was enhanced, whereas that by means of the MDRD formula was blunted,  compared with the group younger than 65 years (-11.3 versus -3.7 mL/min/1.73 m2  [-0.19 versus -0.06 mL/s/1.73 m2] for CG and -3.7 versus -14.0 mL/min/1.73 m2  [-0.06 versus -0.23 mL/s/1.73 m2] for MDRD). GFR was underestimated to a large  extent by means of the MDRD equation irrespective of BMI. Conversely, the  underestimation by means of the CG formula found in lean people (-13.0  mL/min/1.73 m2 [-0.22 mL/s/1.73 m2]) was blunted in overweight people (BMI, 25 to  30 kg/m2) and reversed to overestimation (+10.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 [+0.17 mL/s/1.73  m2]) in obese subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2). CONCLUSION: As suggested by estimations  obtained using enzymatic serum creatinine measurement, the MDRD equation may be  the estimation of choice in elderly patients, whereas the CG estimate is  preferable in subjects younger than 65 years. Nevertheless, when obesity is  present, no reliable estimation can be obtained by using the CG or MDRD formula.","2005-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","233-241","","2","46","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16112041","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Aged, 80 and over; *Algorithms; Comorbidity; Obesity/epidemiology/physiopathology; *Body Mass Index; *Kidney Function Tests; Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic; False Positive Reactions; Hypertension/epidemiology; Outpatients; Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Age Factors; Creatinine/*blood; Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate/pharmacokinetics; Blood Chemical Analysis/methods; Kidney Diseases/blood/epidemiology/physiopathology/urine; Picrates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used the  calculation of area under the curve of serum creatinine (AUC Cr) in the first 7 d  post-transplant to assess early graft function and examine the influence on  longer term outcome. METHODS: A total of 188 live donor renal transplants  performed between 1998 and 2007 were analyzed. AUC Cr was calculated over the  first 7 d post-transplant and 12 mo serum creatinine levels recorded. Donor and  recipient demographics were recorded, and univariable and multivariable analyses  were used to determine influencing factors. The sensitivity and specificity of  AUC Cr for the detection of reduced serum creatinine at 12 mo (cut-off 130  μmol/L) were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.  RESULTS: There was a significant variation in levels of AUC Cr over the first 7 d  post-transplant (range, 692-5765 μmol/L.d). The ROC curve had a relatively low  predictive value for the AUC Cr calculation (AUC=0.735). However, multivariable  analysis showed that higher levels of AUC Cr were associated with higher serum  creatinine levels at 12 mo (slope 0.012; P=0.0005). The need for dialysis, lower  kidney weight, and higher recipient weight were significant independent  predictors of a higher serum creatinine at 12 mo. CONCLUSION: The calculation of  AUC serum creatinine 7 d post-transplant highlighted the significant variation in  early graft function following live donor transplantation and was associated with  creatinine levels at 12 mo. This calculation may be used as a simple prognostic  marker to highlight poorer graft outcome.","2011-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","838-843","","2","171","","J Surg Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: The V/CrCl ratio is a pharmacokinetic risk factor for an early  abnormal increase in serum creatinine (i.e., within 24 hr) after PCI. METHODS:  V/CrCl ratios were obtained from 1,140 consecutive consenting patients after  unselective PCI. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to  identify the optimal sensitivity for the observed range of V/CrCl. The predictive  value of V/CrCl for the risk of CIN was assessed using multivariate logistic  regression. RESULTS: Fifty-five (4.8%) patients out of 1,140 developed CIN. There  was a significant association between higher V/CrCl ratio values and risk of CIN  in the overall population: 1.4%, 1.4%, 5.7%, and 10.9% for quartile 1 (Q1) of the  V/CrCl value (<1.56, n = 283), Q2 (1.56-2.27, n = 289), Q3 (2.28-3.42, n = 282),  and Q4 (>3.42, n = 285) of contrast, respectively (P < 0.001).

This study examined the degree of concordance  between eGFR and CCr and the risk factors leading to the overestimation of renal  function by eGFR. METHODS: A total of 53 data points of 19 children and 56 data  points of 16 adults who received chemotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. Body  mass index, serum creatinine concentration, 24-h urinary creatinine excretion  (UCr), and nephrectomy were considered as risk factors for overestimation by  eGFR. RESULTS: In the pediatric part of the study, 7 data points from 3 patients  who underwent nephrectomy were included. The eGFR in patients with bilateral  kidneys overestimated renal function to a greater degree than in patients with a  unilateral kidney. In 45.7 % of pediatric patients with bilateral kidneys and in  19.6 % of adult patients, eGFR overestimated renal function. The risk factor for  overestimation was lower UCr in pediatric patients with bilateral kidneys and  adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: Concordance between eGFR and CCr in pediatric  patients with a unilateral kidney should be assessed separately from that in  patients with bilateral kidneys. In restricting calculation of eGFR to pediatric  patients with bilateral kidneys and adult patients without little muscle mass,  eGFR may be useful regardless of whether patients are receiving chemotherapy.","2015-04","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","298-308","","2","19","","Clin Exp Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 24792810","","","","Adult; Humans; Japan; Male; Female; Risk Factors; Area Under Curve; Young Adult; Child; ROC Curve; Child, Preschool; Retrospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Nephrectomy; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Lactones; Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use; Creatinine/*blood/*urine; *Mathematical Concepts; Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether such models  remain viable after conversion to isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) SCr  assay. METHODS: This study analyzed data from retrospective reviews of the  medical records of nonobese adults receiving the aminoglycoside gentamicin and  having ≥2 evaluable serum gentamicin concentrations after laboratory IDMS SCr  conversion, from January 2008 to August 2009, at a tertiary care hospital in  Florida. A literature search found a number of cited aminoglycoside models. This  group of models was classified as group 1. The World Wide Web was also searched  for the term aminoglycoside dosing calculators, with 6 models found and referred  to as group 2. Predictive performance measures were used to compare the model  results with the t(½) calculated from gentamicin concentrations using the  Nelder-Mead algorithm. RESULTS: The records of 39 patients met the inclusion  criteria (23 men, 16 women; age range, 18-86 years; range of estimated CrCl,  55-115 mL/min) and provided the ""gold standard"" aminoglycoside t(½). A gentamicin  t(½) was predicted from several published models (group 1) and from other models  used in online smart-device applications (group 2) and clinical decision modules.  The median (interquartile range) root mean square errors were 0.48 (0.44 to 0.65)  and 0.48 (0.45 to 0.70) hours from group-1 and -2 models, respectively.

In this study we investigated if a low  creatinine clearance of < 65 ml/min is also a risk factor for falls and fractures  in elderly men and women treated for osteoporosis. In a cross-sectional study  with the help of questionnaires we assessed the prevalence of having experienced  falls within the last 12 months according to renal function in 5,313 German men  and women receiving treatment for osteoporosis. The CrCl was calculated using the  established Cockcroft-Gault formula. The prevalence of falls and fractures was  assessed in multivariate-controlled logistic regression models according to a  CrCl cut off of 65 ml/min. The P-values were two-sided. In this study of elderly  men and women treated for osteoporosis (n=5,313), 60.9% (n=3,238) had a CrCl of <  65 ml/min, which was associated in multivariate controlled analyses, compared to  a CrCl of > or = 65 ml/min (n=2,075), with a significant increased risk of  experiencing falls (1,775/3,238 vs. 773/2,075, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.50-1.91,  P<0.0001) and an increased risk for multiple falls (37.1 vs. 22.6%, OR 1.63, 95%  CI 1.42-1.87, P<0.0001).

Similar to community-dwelling elderly, in elderly men and women treated for  osteoporosis a CrCl of less than 65 ml/min is a significant and independent risk  factor for falls.

METHODS: Forty-eight patients receiving whole-body I-131-scintigraphy were  included. eGFR(CysC) was compared to eGFR(Crea) with regard to accuracy of  t(1/2,eff) prediction. Three different methods (i.e. blood-based, gamma  camera-based and probe-based) and two protocols with either three (short  period,SP; up to 42 h) or four (long period,LP; up to 114 h) time points were  compared using the Akaike's information criterion. RESULTS: The eGFR(CysC)  measurement is more likely than eGFR(Crea) in predicting the t(1/2,eff). High  correlation coefficients were found between t(1/2,eff) assessed by gamma camera  and probe measurements and blood-based determination revealed lower values.  Patients with normal eGFR showed higher values of t(1/2,eff) of LP compared to  SP. CONCLUSIONS: eGFR(CysC) should be included in further study protocols. As  camera and probe measurements lead to almost superimposable results, one of the  methods is expendable. Blood-based results of t(1/2,eff) were lower, presumably  due to unspecific iodine retention, whereas the lower correlation with renal  function may be caused by individual differences in intestinal iodine resorption.  SP-protocols up to 42 h after I-131 administration are sufficient to determine  t(1/2,eff). Further studies are necessary for specific recommendations regarding  I-131 activity reduction during RAIT in patients with DTC and renal  insufficiency.","2019-03","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","554-562","","3","63","","Endocrine","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30382554","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Prospective Studies; Half-Life; Aged, 80 and over; Creatinine/blood; Cystatin C/blood; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; Iodine Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics; eGFR; Carcinoma/*radiotherapy; Effective Half-life; Gamma Cameras; Radioiodine Therapy; Renal insufficiency; Thyroid Cancer; Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increase in serum creatinine levels is considered a  result of competition with abemaciclib via organic cation transporter 2 and  multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. Therefore, we evaluated the association  among serum creatinine levels, serum abemaciclib concentrations, and adverse  events and whether increase in serum creatinine levels is a useful indicator for  predicting the onset of the adverse events of abemaciclib. Methods In total, the  data of 12 patients with breast cancer who were treated with abemaciclib (150 mg  twice daily) were evaluated to determine the association between increased serum  creatinine levels and abemaciclib concentrations and hematological  toxicity. Results Grade 3 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were observed  at 4 weeks in four (33%), two (17%), and one (8%) patients, respectively. A  significant association was observed between steady-state abemaciclib  concentrations and the rate of decrease in neutrophil and platelet counts  (r = - 0.80, P = 0.003 and r = - 0.70, P = 0.016, respectively). Compared with  baseline levels (0.61 [0.53-0.82] mg/mL), serum creatinine levels significantly  increased and reached a steady state in at least 2 weeks (0.84 [0.61-1.02] mg/mL,  P = 0.01). However, we did not find a significant association between increase in  serum creatinine levels and abemaciclib concentrations and hematological  toxicity. Conclusions Abemaciclib concentrations are associated with neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia. However, increase in serum creatinine levels may not be a  useful predictor for estimating abemaciclib pharmacokinetics and hematological  toxicity.","2021-02","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","272-277","","1","39","","Invest New Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32856274","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Pharmacokinetics; Creatinine; Creatinine/blood; Platelet Count; Neutrophils/metabolism; Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors; Benzimidazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Patient Acuity; Abemaciclib; Adverse event; Aminopyridines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors; Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied 24 children on peritoneal dialysis, including 10 children  aged 9-15.7 years (mean age 12.5 years) treated with 1-1.1 IU/kg/week of rhGH  administered daily for 6 months. The control group included 14 patients aged  5.4-18.3 years (mean age 12.6 years). Kinetic modelling of urea and creatinine  using Adequest was performed in all patients at baseline and after 3 and 6 months  of follow-up. Total dialysate and urinary excretion of urea and creatinine (tUE  and tCE, mg/min), total urea and creatinine clearance (tUC and tCC, L/week),  weekly Kt/V, normalized total weekly creatinine clearance (ntCC, L/week/1.73 m2),  total body water (TBW, kg), and absolute and percent change of TBW (DTBW, kg, and  D%TBW, respectively) were calculated. Albumin level was measured and diet  composition was analysed in all patients. Insignificant decrease in Kt/V was  found after 3 and 6 months of rhGH treatment despite stable values of tUC (45.3  +/- 15 L/week vs 45.6 +/- 15 L/week, p = NS). Serum creatinine increased from  7.38 +/- 1.52 to 9.26 +/- 2.98 mg/dL after 6 months of rhGH treatment.  Significantly higher values of delta %TBW were found among treated patients  compared to the control group (1.23 +/- 0.7 kh vs 0.57 +/- 0.7 kg, P < 0.05).  delta TBW in patients treated with rhGH was significantly higher during months  0-3 compared to months 3-6 (0.85 +/- 0.6 kg and 0.38 +/- 0.17 kg, respectively, p  < 0.05). No significant changes in ntCC, albumin concentration and diet  composition were found. CONCLUSIONS: 1. A trend to lower urea values in children  treated with peritoneal dialysis was found after 3 months of rhGH treatment.  Concomitant decrease in Kt/V may have resulted from increased TBW. 2. An increase  in creatinine level was observed during rhGH treatment in children treated with  peritoneal dialysis. Decrease in normalized total creatinine clearance (ntCC) and  normalized dialysate creatinine clearance (ndCC) during rhGH treatment may have  resulted from increased serum creatinine and not from decreased creatinine  excretion. 3. Treatment with rhGH in children on peritoneal dialysis makes it  difficult to interpret commonly used indices of dialysis adequacy such as Kt/V  and ntCC.","2002-09","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","191-195","","75","13","","Pol Merkur Lekarski","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 12474568","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Case-Control Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Child; Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage; *Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory; Urea/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Creatinine/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Human Growth Hormone/*administration & dosage; Kidney Failure, Chronic/drug therapy/*metabolism/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mean 4-hour and 8-hour creatinine clearances were not significantly different  from the 24-hour values. Clearance values from 8-hour collections between  24:00-08:00 and 16:00-24:00 were found to be the most accurate and gave the best  correlations. Furthermore only the mean absolute percentage deviations of the  8-hour from the 24-hour clearance values were significantly less than 20%.  Significant cyclical variations in creatinine clearance over 24 hours were not  observed. Time intervals between 23:00-07:00 and 07:00-09:00 were chosen for the  comparisons between 8-hour, 2-hour, Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance  estimations and the 24-hour values in 21 healthy subjects. The mean 2-hour and  8-hour creatinine clearances were not significantly different from the 24-hour  values. However, once again only the 8-hour clearance values differed by less  than 20% from the 24-hour values and they were more accurate and better  correlated than the 2-hour values. As expected, in both groups of subjects, the  percentage of clearance values that deviated by more than 20% from the 24-hour  values decreased as the length of the collection times increased. The Cockcroft  Gault formula in both groups of volunteers gave less accurate clearance  estimations, smaller correlation coefficients (not statistically significant in  Group I subjects) and percentage deviations from the 24-hour values greater than  20%. Undetected early stage renal insufficiency in three volunteers and the use  of actual instead of normalized Scr values may have been the cause of these poor  clearance estimations. In healthy subjects (Scr < 1.5 mg/dl) 24-hour creatinine  clearance may be estimated from an 8-hour urine collection with voluntary voiding  if a 20% deviation from the 24-hour value is considered clinically acceptable.","1998-12","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","258-263","","6","20","","Pharm World Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 9972527","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Circadian Rhythm; Kidney Function Tests/*methods; Creatinine/blood/metabolism/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AMI and VAN are eliminated  untransformed by glomerular filtration, showing depuration ratio highly  correlated with creatinine (CRE) clearance. AMI, VAN and CRE are highly polar  structures, presenting poor retention in reversed-phase liquid chromatography  when using conventional stationary phases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop  and validate a simple UPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of AMI,  VAN, and CRE in human plasma for therapeutic drug monitoring. RESULTS: Samples  were prepared by protein precipitation, followed by dilution. Heptafluorobutyric  acid (HFBA) was added to the mobile phase at low concentration (0.01%), and  separation was performed in an ultra-performance reversed-phase column (particle  diameter of 1.8 μm). These conditions allowed retention times of 0.92, 0.93,  2.12, 2.17 and 2.27 min for CRE, CRE-D3, AMI, KAN and VAN, respectively. The  assay was linear from 0.5 to 100 mg L(-1) for AMI and VAN and 5 to 100 mg L(-1).  Precision, accuracy and stability assays were acceptable according to  bioanalytical validation guidelines. Suitable results. Matrix effects were in the  range of +10.5 to +11.6% for AMI, -4.3 to -4.5% for VAN, and - 1.7 to +0.7 for  CRE. CONCLUSION: The first assay for the simultaneous determination of AMI, VAN  and CRE in plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was reported.  This assay allows the obtention of the necessary analytical data for the clinical  application of population pharmacokinetic methods for therapeutic drug monitoring  of AMI and VAN.","2019-08","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","39-45","","","70","","Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

B.","Effect of high-dose growth hormone and glutamine on body composition, urine creatinine excretion, fatty acid absorption, and essential fatty acids status in  short bowel patients: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled  study.","Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology","","0036-5521","10.1080/00365520150218057","","BACKGROUND: Positive effects of high dose growth hormone and glutamine (GH + GLN) on body composition in short bowel patients have been described. Lack of effects  on intestinal absorption found in some studies has been ascribed to concomitant  essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency. This study describes changes in body  weight (BW) and composition, 24-h urine creatinine excretion, intestinal fatty  acid absorption (total, saturated, unsaturated and EFA), and EFA status in  relation to treatment with GH + GLN in 8 short bowel patients. METHODS: A  double-blind, crossover study between placebo and growth hormone (mean, 0.12  mg/kg/day) plus oral (mean, 28 g/day) and parenteral glutamine (mean, 5.2 g/day)  for 28 days. Body composition was measured by dual-energy absorptiometry (DEXA)  scans. Intestinal fatty acid absorption was evaluated in balance studies, and  EFAs were measured in plasma phospholipids by gas liquid chromatography. RESULTS:  Active treatment did not increase BW, lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM) and  bone mass significantly compared with placebo treatment, but BW increased 1.03 kg  (1.7%, P < 0.05), LBM 2.93 kg (8.7%, P < 0.001) and FM decreased 2.41 kg (10.6%,  P < 0.001) in comparison with baseline. Twenty-four-hour urine creatinine  excretion did not differ between study periods. No changes in intestinal  absorption of fatty acids were seen, and no changes in EFAs measured in plasma  phospholipids were observed. Only 1 of 8 patients, who did not receive parenteral  lipids, had a Holman index above 0.2, indicative of EFA deficiency. All developed  peripheral oedema. CONCLUSIONS: Combined high dose growth hormone and glutamine  administered for 4 weeks, did not improve absorption of fatty acids or EFA status  in short bowel patients. No changes in BW or composition were seen when comparing  treatment to placebo periods. The increase in LBM measured by DEXA scan,  comparing treatment and baseline periods, was not accompanied by an increase in  the 24-h urinary creatinine excretion and is suspected to be associated with an  accumulation in extracellular fluids.","2001-01","2023-07-10 09:10:22","2023-07-10 09:10:22","","48-54","","1","36","","Scand J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11218239","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Cross-Over Studies; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; Absorptiometry, Photon; Creatinine/urine; Body Weight/drug effects; Fatty Acids/metabolism; Body Composition/drug effects; Fatty Acids, Essential/metabolism; Glutamine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Human Growth Hormone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Phospholipids/blood/chemistry; Short Bowel Syndrome/*drug therapy/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
