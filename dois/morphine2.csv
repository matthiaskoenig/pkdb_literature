Intravenous oxycodone produced a faster onset of pain relief than  oxycodone tablets, but the duration of analgesia was approximately the same (4  hours). However, the incidence of side effects and their severity were  significantly higher (p < 0.05) for intravenous oxycodone than for oxycodone  tablets. The marked interindividual variation observed in the pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone in this study supports the need for  individualized dosing regimens.","1992-11","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:56:32","","487-495","","5","52","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Leow1992b PMID: 1424423 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Analysis of Variance; Aged; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Half-Life; Injections, Intravenous; Biological Availability; Pain/*drug therapy/etiology; Neoplasms/*complications; Oxycodone/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dose proportionality of OROS hydromorphone has been shown in  healthy Caucasian volunteers; however, no studies have been conducted in Asian  populations. To determine whether ethnic differences affect the drug's  pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, we evaluated the dose proportionality of OROS  hydromorphone in healthy Taiwanese adults. METHODS: This 12-week, open-label,  4-way crossover, phase 1 study randomly assigned subjects to 1 of 4 treatment  sequences - single oral dose OROS hydromorphone: 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg, or 64 mg -  along with 50 mg naltrexone. Dose proportionality was assessed using a linear  mixed-effects model to estimate the slope of the regression line and its 90% CI  for Cmax, AUC0-48h, and AUClast. Descriptive statistics measured plasma  hydromorphone concentrations, PK parameters, laboratory analytes, and vital  signs. RESULTS: 23 subjects completed the study; a single-dose of OROS  hydromorphone increased plasma concentration steadily for 6 hours and sustained  it at or near maximum levels for ~ 24 hours. After dose normalization to a 16 mg  dose, all studied doses demonstrated dose proportionality for Cmax, AUClast, and  AUC0-48h,as the slopes of the regression lines for Cmax, AUClast, and AUC0-48h  were close to zero, and the 90% CIs within pre-specified limits. Adverse events  were as expected for hydromorphone administered with concomitant naltrexone.  CONCLUSIONS: Single doses of 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg, and 64 mg of OROS hydromorphone  were found to be dose proportional for Cmax, AUClast, and AUC0-48h and were  generally safe and well-tolerated in healthy Taiwanese adults.","2014-03","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:19:40","","217-226","","3","52","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Vandenbossche2014b PMID: 24472398 place: Germany","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Young Adult; Delayed-Action Preparations; Hydromorphone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatments included a MS constant rate  infusion followed by an oral MS solution (MS-OS) (5 to 15 mg administered every 3  hours) and then a 30 mg MS-controlled release tablet (MS-CR) every 8 hours. Each  treatment was separated by a washout period when sampling of morphine was done.  The apparent terminal half-life for MS-OS was 3 hours, which is similar to that  of patients without burns, but the apparent terminal half-life for the MS-CR in  patients with burns was substantially longer at 14.7 hours. The mean time to  reach peak concentration for MS-CR was delayed relative to MS-OS 1.4 versus 0.5  hours, and the peak concentration was attenuated. The mean release time of the MS  for the CR tablet is about 15 hours. The renal clearances of the MS-CR (114  ml/min) and MS-OS (147 ml/min) were less than the measured creatinine clearance  (177 ml/min) but greater than the creatinine clearance (106 ml/min) predicted for  a healthy individual. The prolonged release of MS-CR makes the MS-CR a good  choice in the management of pain in patients with burns on an 8- to 12-hour  dosing schedule, even though the patient might exhibit an increased clearance.","1994-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:15:42","","95-103","","2","15","","J Burn Care Rehabil","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Herman1994a PMID: 8195267 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Biological Availability; Infusions, Intravenous; Pain/*drug therapy; Delayed-Action Preparations; Solutions; Burns/*metabolism; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2) To determine differences with age within the group  and from adults. (3) To explore relationships between plasma concentration and  pain measurements. STUDY DESIGN: Blood samples were collected and plasma analyzed  by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical and fluorescence  detection. Population pharmacokinetic parameters were derived with the program  P-PHARM. RESULTS: Forty children with a median age of 11.4 years (range 1.7 to  18.7 years) received a median dose of 1.4 mg/kg/d (range 0.4 to 24.6 mg/kg/d). A  median of 4 blood samples per child was collected. Plasma clearance of morphine  was 23.1 mL/min per kg body weight. The volume of distribution was 5.2 L/kg.  Molar ratios of M3G/morphine, M6G/morphine, and M3G/M6G were 21.1, 4.7, and 4.2,  respectively. Children <11 years had significantly higher clearance and larger  volume of distribution for morphine and its glucuronides than older children and  adults. Regression analysis indicated average plasma morphine concentration equal  to dose (mg/kg/d) x 8.6 (95% confidence interval 7.4 to 9.9). Significant pain  was present in 30% of the children. Higher pain scores were recorded in children  with average morphine concentrations <12 ng/mL (P <.01 MW). CONCLUSION: Age  differences in morphine pharmacokinetics exist within children and compared with  adults.

Hydromorphone  (0.075 mg/kg) was administered intravenously as a bolus or intramuscularly on  separate occasions to healthy, socially housed, socially reared, adult, intact  male rhesus macaques (n = 4). Blood samples were collected prior to and until 10  h after administration. Serum hydromorphone concentrations were analyzed with  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compartment models were fit to  time-concentration data. A 3-compartment model with input in and elimination from  the central compartment best fit intravenous data, whereas a 1-comparment model  best fit intramuscular data. After intravenous administration, the median  clearance and terminal half-life were 37.7 (range, 33.7 to 47.1) mL/kg/min and  142 (range, 131 to 218) min, respectively. The median (range) elimination  half-life after intramuscular administration was 81.5 (77.2 to 92.5) min. Median  intramuscular bioavailability was 92% (range, 75% to 104%).

METHODS: Twenty subjects with asthma received inhaled placebo and inhaled  morphine sulfate, 2.2 mg, 4.4 mg and 8.8 mg, on separate days in a single-blind  crossover study. Six of the subjects received an additional open-label dose of  17.6 mg on a separate day. Plasma morphine concentrations and safety evaluations  including pulmonary function testing were performed. RESULTS: Mean tmax values  were similar following all dose groups at approximately 1-2 minutes. Mean  AUC(0-->1) values showed dose proportionality for the first 3 dose groups (6.3,  12.3 and 24.3 ng x h x ml(-1)), the mean AUC(0-->1) for the 17.6 mg dose group  was 1.6x that of the 8.8 mg dose group.

Serum samples were drawn at intervals up to 480 min following oral and 420 min  following i.v. administration. Serum was analysed for morphine concentration  using a radioimmunoassay. Data were analysed using non-compartmental  pharmacokinetics. The only statistically significant difference between OSRMS and  NSRMS was maximum serum concentration (Cmax). There were trends toward longer  time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) and longer mean absorption time (MAT)  for OSRMS when compared to NSRMS, but the differences were not statistically  significant (P < 0.05). Pharmacokinetic parameters for both oral formulations  exhibited large variability in the rate of absorption of MS from the  gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability of both OSRMS and NSRMS was low  (15%-17%). As expected, the area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC) and  Cmax for the i.v. data was significantly greater than for both oral groups, and  Tmax and mean residence time (MRT) were significantly less following i.v.  administration. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3  treatment groups for apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) or  elimination parameters. The OSRMS formulation used in this study provided  equivalent bioavailability to NSRMS in dogs, accompanied by large individual  variability in drug absorption. It also did not appear that the sustained release  formulation provided sufficiently prolonged release of morphine sulfate from the  tablet matrix in dogs to allow prolonged dosing intervals compared to NSRMS.","1997-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:28:27","","251-255","","4","61","","Can J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Dohoo1997b PMCID: PMC1189417 PMID: 9342447 place: Canada","","","","Female; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Area Under Curve; Biological Availability; Delayed-Action Preparations; Injections, Intravenous/veterinary; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Dogs/blood/*metabolism/physiology; Morphine/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Radioimmunoassay/methods/veterinary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The efficacy of this opioid in the treatment of  postoperative pain has been proved in different groups of patients. The drug has  a favourable adverse reaction profile, which encourages doctors and patients to  use it more and more widely. The drug is also used in the patients who underwent  an abdominal surgery, e.g. stomach resection. Gastrectomy leads to  pathophysiological changes within the gastrointestinal tract, which may cause  changes in the drug absorption. In consequence this leads to a change in the  pharmacokinetics and effect of the drug. The aim of the research was an analysis  of the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone from prolonged release tablet in patients  after total gastrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The research was carried out on  patients after gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The patients (n=24;  mean [SD] age, 67.6 [9.8] years; weight, 69.1 [13.6] kg; and BMI, 25.2 [4.0]  kg/m(2)) received oxycodone in a prolonged release tablet in a single orally  administered dose of 10 mg. Blood samples were collected within 12 h after the  drug administration. The plasma concentrations of oxycodone and noroxycodone were  measured with validated high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with triple  tandem mass spectrometery method. RESULTS: The main pharmacokinetic parameters  for oxycodone in men (n = 14) and women (n = 10) were as follows: Cmax, 14.40  (3.76) and 11.54 (6.98) ng/ml (p = 0.2066); AUC0-∞, 157.87 (56.89) and 106.44  (61.31) ng´h/ml (p = 0.0460); tmax, 2.18 (0.58) and 2.15 (0.58) h (p = 0.8008),  respectively.

CONCLUSION: The increased and prolonged  duration of pain relief after morphine administration seen in some elderly  patients cannot, based on these findings, be ascribed to changes in the  pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and younger patients. Similar for  oxycodone, no changes in the pharmacokinetic could be found when comparing the  parameters found in elderly patients with those from younger healthy volunteers.  A great variability within the individual pharmacokinetic parameters was seen for  both drugs. Therefore, we recommend that treatment with morphine and oxycodone in  elderly patients is initiated very conservatively and is titrated slowly to  effect.","2007-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:19:56","","961-967","","5","3","","Ther Clin Risk Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Villesen2007b PMCID: PMC2376067 PMID: 18473019 place: New Zealand","","","","pharmacokinetics; elderly; oxycodone; morphine; age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RIA-A and RIA-B differed only with respect to the  particular pool of antibodies used, and both were elicited from rabbits immunized  with a 2-diazomorphine-protein conjugate. In vitro inhibition studies indicated  the molar ratio of M-3-G/morphine which inhibited 3H-morphine-antimorphine  binding by 50% (150) was 90 and 14 for RIA-A and RIA-B, respectively. RIA-B 150  values were dependent on the final protein concentration of the incubation  mixture. RIA-A and RIA-B estimates of the ME per milliliter were in agreement in  serum samples obtained from rabbits after i.v. morphine 0.01 mg/kg; however,  after higher doses only samples obtained in the first minutes agreed and at later  times RIA-B estimates exceeded RIA-A by increasing amounts. After i.v. M-3-G (1.0  mg/kg) RIA-B estimated 20 to 25 times more ME per milliliter than RIA-A. After  rapid i.v. administration of morphine (1 or 5 mg/kg) the disappearance curves  obtained with RIA-B were multiphasic and contained a prolonged terminal phase  with an estimated half-life of 24 hours. The higher estimates obtained with RIA-B  are best explained by cross-reactions with M-3-G or other morphine metabolites.  With RIA-A the mean serum morphine clearance (86 ml/min/kg) and half-life of the  elimination phase (74 minutes were independent of dosage. The least complicated  pharmacokinetic model which describes the disposition of morphine in the rabbit  is the open two-compartment model.","1977-01","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:20:56","","224-235","","1","200","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Catlin1977a PMID: 833758 place: United States","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Models, Biological; Rabbits/immunology; Radioimmunoassay; Immune Sera/pharmacology; Glucuronates/metabolism; Morphine/blood/immunology/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, CSF samples, are available  only in rare circumstances. If they can be obtained they may provide important  insights into the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of opioids. METHODS: Nine  neurological and neurosurgical patients (age 19-69 years) received 0.5 mg kg-1  morphine sulphate pentahydrate as an intravenous infusion over 30 min. Plasma and  CSF were collected for up to 48 h. Concentration time-course and interindividual  variability of morphine (M), morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6  glucuronide (M6G) were analysed using population pharmacokinetic modelling.  RESULTS: While morphine was rapidly cleared from plasma (total clearance = 1838  ml min-1 (95% CI 1668, 2001 ml min-1)) the glucuronide metabolites were  eliminated more slowly (clearance M3G = 44.5 ml min-1 (35.1, 53.9 ml min-1),  clearance M6G = 42.1 ml min-1 (36.4, 47.7 ml min-1)) and their clearance could be  described as a function of creatinine clearance. The central volumes of  distribution were estimated to be 12.7 l (11.1, 14.3 l) for morphine. Transfer  from the central compartment into the CSF was also rapid for M and considerably  slower for both glucuronide metabolites. Maximum concentrations were achieved  after 102 min (M), 417 min (M3G) and 443 min (M6G). A P-glycoprotein exon 26  polymorphism previously found to be linked with transport activity could be  involved in CSF accessibility, since the homozygous mutant genotype was  associated (P < 0.001) with high maximum CSF concentrations of M but not M3G or  M6G. CONCLUSIONS: From the population pharmacokinetic model presented, CSF  concentration profiles can be derived for M, M3G and M6G on the basis of dosing  information and creatinine clearance without collecting CSF samples. Such  profiles may then serve as the link between dose regimen and effect measurements  in future clinical effect studies.","2002-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:23:48","","592-603","","6","54","","Br J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Meineke2002a PMID: 12492606 place: England","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Models, Biological; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Genotype; Infusions, Intravenous; Genes, MDR; Creatinine/pharmacokinetics; Central Nervous System Stimulants/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics; Intracranial Hemorrhages/metabolism; Morphine Derivatives/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics; Narcotics/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This cohort study was carried out in a  teaching hospital. Sixty-six young, healthy male subjects from 3 ethnic groups  (Caucasians, native Indians, and Latinos; n = 22 in each group) consented to  participate. All subjects received an intravenous morphine bolus of 0.08 mg/kg  followed by 0.002 mg/kg. min infused for 30 minutes. Respiratory response was  evaluated with the carbon dioxide rebreathing method before and at 25, 95, 180,  and 360 minutes after morphine administration. Vital signs and opioid side  effects were recorded, and serial blood samples were analyzed for morphine,  morphine-3-glucuronide, and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). RESULTS: All 3 groups  had suppression of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia, but the degree of  blunting of the ventilatory response differed among groups. Compared with  Caucasians, native Indians had an additional 18% reduction in ventilatory  response after morphine administration (95% confidence interval, -35% to -2%).  The incidence of side effects was similar in all groups (P =.18). Caucasians had  higher plasma levels of M6G than did native Indians or Latinos. M6G areas under  6-hour concentration-versus-time curve were as follows: Caucasians, 12,065 +/-  4354; native Indians, 8464 +/- 4809; and Latinos, 9156 +/- 3764 ng. min/mL (P  =.03).

SETTING: Both studies were multicenter  clinical studies. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In study 1, 115 subjects with  postsurgical pain (bunionectomy) received single doses of 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg  hydrocodone-ER, 10 mg hydrocodone/325 mg acetaminophen immediate-release (IR), or  placebo. In study 2, 37 subjects with osteoarthritic pain received doses of 10,  20, 30, or 40 mg of hydrocodone- ER twice-daily for 7 days. Venous blood samples  were taken periodically up to 24 hours postdosing after the single dose (study 1)  or after 7 days of dosing (study 2) and were assayed for concentrations of  hydrocodone and its major metabolites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standard  pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis methods.  RESULTS: Following a single dose of hydrocodone-ER, Tmax was prolonged to  approximately 6 hours at all dose levels of hydrocodone-ER compared with 2.9  hours for the IR formulation. All doses of hydrocodone-ER formulations provided  prolonged and sustained release of hydrocodone throughout the 12-hour dosing  interval with reduced peak-to-trough fluctuation at steady state compared with  hydrocodone/acetaminophen-IR comparator.

Geriatric  analgesia requires special consideration of age-associated physiologic changes  that can affect drug dosing. The study of extended-release (ER) oxymorphone in  older (≥ 65 years of age) versus younger (18-40 years of age) male and female  volunteers was described. METHODS: In this multiple-dose, parallel-group,  open-label trial, healthy volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg  oxymorphone ER on day 1, followed by a 48-hour washout period, then two oral  doses of 20 mg oxymorphone ER tablets every 12 hours from day 3 to day 8, and a  single oral dose of 20 mg oxymorphone ER on day 9. Naltrexone was administered  each day to the subjects. RESULTS: The elderly had significantly higher plasma  levels of oxymorphone, 6-OH-oxymorphone, and oxymorphone-3-glucuronide than the  younger group (1.36-fold higher area under the concentration versus time curve  [AUC] and 1.45-fold higher C(max)) when they were treated with a single dose (20  mg) of oxymorphone. Steady-state AUC and C(max) also were higher in the older  group. Following adjustment for body weight, AUC values for oxymorphone and its  metabolites were about 40 percent higher and the mean C(max) values were 30-35  percent higher in the older group compared to the younger group. CONCLUSION: The  results of the current study of an ER formulation revealed no pharmacokinetic  features that would preclude dosing in the elderly. As with any drug and any age  group (but particularly the elderly), oxymorphone ER should be initiated at lower  doses in elderly compared to younger patients and titrated to optimal level.","2012-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:07:36","","383-393","","6","8","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Pergolizzi2012a PMID: 23264316 place: United States","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Area Under Curve; Age Factors; Young Adult; Delayed-Action Preparations; Tablets; Glucuronides/pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Naltrexone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Narcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Oxymorphone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over a 72-hr implant  period one, two or three 75-mg morphine pellets released 12.5, 22.6 and 27.6 mg  of morphine, respectively. Mean plasma morphine concentration after two morphine  pellets reached a peak at 4 to 6 hr, then declined to a mean apparent  steady-state level of 210 ng/ml at 36 hr that was maintained until the pellets  were removed at 72 hr. The antinociceptive action of two morphine pellets peaked  at 4 to 6 hr and had returned to predrug base-line values by 36 hr. After pellet  removal, the plasma elimination kinetics of morphine were biexponential with a  terminal T1/2 of 8.3 hr. The plasma morphine concentration declined 85% before  the onset of significant weight loss could be measured. Peak abstinence weight  loss was dose-related and was significantly correlated with both plasma morphine  levels just before withdrawal and total dose of morphine absorbed over the 72-hr  implant. These studies indicate that the release of morphine from s.c. implanted  pellets in the rat is characterized by an initially higher rate of release (dose  dumping effect) over the first 24 hr followed by a very constant release from 36  to 72 hr after implantation. The pharmacodynamic consequences of these dosage  characteristics are the rapid development of tolerance and maintenance of  physical dependence during the period of the implant.","1985-11","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:22:41","","282-286","","2","235","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Yoburn1985a PMID: 4057070 place: United States","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Body Weight; Rats, Inbred Strains; Delayed-Action Preparations; Injections, Subcutaneous; Mathematics; Pain/drug therapy; Morphine/*administration & dosage/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical pharmacokinetic considerations of oral treatment.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-198611020-00001","","Several clinical studies have shown oral morphine and methadone to be effective in the treatment of intractable pain in patients with malignant disease. Recent  pharmacokinetic studies have confirmed the rationale for regular administration  of oral morphine and methadone but have revealed marked interindividual  differences in the kinetics and metabolism which must be considered when  titrating the oral dose according to the individual patient's need. Oral  absorption of morphine in patients with malignant diseases is rapid, with peak  plasma concentrations occurring at 20 to 90 minutes. Predose steady-state  concentrations bear a constant relationship to dose, but vary considerably  between individuals. The oral bioavailability is approximately 40% with marked  patient-to-patient variations as a result of differences in presystemic  elimination. The reported values for the volume of distribution range from 1.0 to  4.7 L/kg. Plasma protein binding is about 30%. The elimination half-life varies  between 0.7 and 7.8 hours. Plasma clearance is approximately 19 ml/min/kg (5 to  34 ml/min/kg) and mostly accounted for by metabolic clearance. Studies in a few  patients with malignant diseases treated regularly with daily doses of oral  morphine ranging from 20 to 750mg indicate a linear relationship between the dose  and trough concentration of morphine. Long term treatment with 10- to 20-fold  increase of the oral dose over a period of 6 to 8 months does not seem to change  the kinetics of oral morphine. The plasma concentrations of the main metabolite,  morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), exceed those of the parent drug by approximately  10-fold after intravenous administration and by 20-fold after oral  administration. The relationship between the area under the plasma  concentration-time curve (AUC) of morphine and the AUC of morphine-3-glucuronide  remains constant during the development of tolerance upon long term treatment  with increasing doses. Renal disease causes a significant increase in the mean  plasma concentrations of morphine for 15 minutes after its administration, while  mean values of terminal half-life and total body clearance are within the normal  range. However, the glucuronidated polar metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide rises  rapidly to high concentrations which persist for several days. Chronic liver  disease causes an increase in the bioavailability of oral morphine but no, or  only a slight reduction in the intravenous clearance. The elimination half-life  and volume of distribution are within the normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400  WORDS)","1986-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:30:54","","87-106","","2","11","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Sawe1986a PMID: 3514045 place: Switzerland","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Administration, Oral; Protein Binding; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Half-Life; Intestinal Absorption; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Biological Availability; Tissue Distribution; Pain/*drug therapy; Aging; Kidney Diseases/metabolism; Liver Diseases/metabolism; Neoplasms/metabolism/*physiopathology; Methadone/administration & dosage/*blood; Morphine/administration & dosage/*blood; Opioid-Related Disorders/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, open-label study recruited men  and women > or = 18 years of age scheduled for major upper abdominal surgery.  Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups and were administered  a single 15-mg dose of EREM or EREM preceded by a 3 ml lidocaine  (1.5%)/epinephrine (1 : 200,000) test dose with or without a saline flush: EREM  alone; test dose + flush + 3-minute wait + EREM; test dose + flush + 10-minute  wait + EREM; test dose + flush + 15-minute wait + EREM; or test dose + 3-minute  wait + EREM. EREM was administered at the lower thoracic epidural intervertebral  space (T8 - T12) approximately 30 minutes before the surgical incision.  Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on the serum  concentration-time profiles of morphine and morphine metabolites. Effectiveness  and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat and safety  populations included 39 patients; the pharmacokinetic population included 37  patients. Administration of EREM 3 minutes after a lidocaine-epinephrine test  dose, with or without a flush, resulted in an increased mean maximum serum  concentration of morphine (Cmax; flush, 30.2 +/- 8.5 ng/ml; no flush, 25.6 +/-  10.1 ng/ml; EREM alone, 11.5 +/- 7.3 ng/ml) and a decreased median time to Cmax  (tmax; flush, 0.2 h; no flush, 0.2 h; EREM alone, 2.0 h) compared with  administration of EREM alone, without affecting relative morphine  bioavailability. Flushing the catheter and waiting 15 minutes normalized the Cmax  (11.4 +/- 6.4 ng/ml) but not the median tmax (0.5 h). There were no significant  group differences in safety, tolerability, or analgesic effectiveness.  CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between EREM and a lidocaine-epinephrine test dose  administered at T8 - T12 can be minimized by waiting 15 minutes after test dose  administration. The overall safety and effectiveness of 15 mg EREM administered  at the lower thoracic epidural intervertebral space in patients undergoing major  upper abdominal surgery appears similar to that observed in previous studies  assessing lumbar administration.

The antinociceptive effect of morphine  (0.5-4 mg/kg i.v.) on mechanical (paw pressure test), thermal (tail immersion  test) and chemical (formalin test) hyperalgesia was reduced. To clarify the  mechanisms involved in the alteration of morphine analgesia, the binding  characteristics of mu and delta receptor agonists and the pharmacokinetics of  morphine and its glucuronide metabolites morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine  6-glucuronide were determined. KD and Bmax values for [3H][D-Ala2,(Me)Phe4,  Gly(ol)5]enkephalin and [3H][D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin to cerebral mu and delta  opiate receptors were not altered by diabetes. Likewise, the plasma maximal  concentration of morphine and metabolites, as well as the area under the curve,  did not differ between diabetic and normal rats. Only the total clearance and the  apparent volume of distribution of morphine were increased in diabetic rats,  which suggests that the diabetes-induced glycosylation of proteins might increase  the distribution of morphine in the aqueous compartment. These data indicate that  the reduced analgesic effect of morphine caused by diabetes cannot be explained  by a decrease in opiate-receptor affinity or density but rather by kinetic  alteration of morphine (increase of total clearance and of volume of distribution  in comparison with healthy animals).","1998-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:15:41","","63-70","","1","285","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Courteix1998a PMID: 9535995 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Pain Measurement; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*metabolism; Streptozocin; Pain Threshold; *Analgesia; Analgesics, Opioid/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics/pharmacokinetics; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Enkephalin, D-Penicillamine (2,5)-; Enkephalins/metabolism; Morphine/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Receptors, Opioid, delta/*metabolism; Receptors, Opioid, mu/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The morphine  concentrations in the CSF were considerably higher compared with plasma (45-100  times the plasma concentration at 1 h, 100-250 times at 3 h, and 125-175 times at  5 h) but the elimination half-life of morphine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)  was similar to that in plasma. The lumbar approach was used with similar efficacy  as reported for thoracic administration. Side effects were few and  nonsignificant. The authors conclude that epidural morphine administration  results in a dose-dependent analgesia, as well as concentrations in the CSF that  are considerably higher than in plasma. With similar elimination half-lives for  morphine in CSF and plasma, the long analgetic duration probably depends on the  locally high morphine concentrations achieved.

The effects of renal or hepatic  impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single, oral doses of Remoxy 20 or 10  mg, respectively, were assessed in two phase 1 studies in subjects aged 18-80  years. METHODS: PK parameters included maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and  area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable  concentration (AUC(0-t)), and extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf). Adverse events  (AEs) were monitored. RESULTS: Mean (SD) oxycodone Cmax values following Remoxy  20-mg administration were 17.6 (9.1), 21.9 (11.2), 25.9 (18.2), and 31.6 (14.5)  ng/mL and AUC0-t values were 210.7 (82.1), 271.6 (83.3), 299.5 (76.3), and 493.5  (175.9) ng·h/mL in subjects with normal or mild (n = 6 each), moderate (n = 5),  and severely impaired renal function (n = 6), respectively.

Systemic bioavailability and peak plasma concentrations  of morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide were significantly greater  after oral morphine administration compared with the rectal route (AUC: M6G,  377.1 +/- 124.2 versus 236.2 +/- 133.7 nmol.hr/L, p = 0.05; M3G, 2610.1 +/- 446.4  versus 1650.2 +/- 309.0 nmol.hr/L, p = 0.004; maximum concentrations: M6G, 110.9  +/- 37.5 versus 64.6 +/- 28.8 nmol/L, p = 0.002; M3G, 576.9 +/- 155.8 versus  266.8 +/- 110.5 nmol/L, p = 0.007). Conversely, the systemic availability of  morphine was lower after oral administration, although this difference failed to  achieve statistical significance (142.3 +/- 17.1 versus 176.6 +/- 69.4 nmol.hr/L,  p = 0.14). These data suggest that rectal administration of morphine is  associated with significant avoidance of hepatic biotransformation, and they  provide a convincing argument for the evaluation of morphine-6-glucuronide  concentrations in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparisons involving  different routes of morphine administration.","1993-09","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-12-04 05:09:47","","286-292","","3","54","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Babul1993a, Babul1993b PMID: 8375123 place: United States","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8375123","Adult; Humans; Male; Administration, Oral; Biological Availability; data:timecourse; species:human; priority:high; Administration, Rectal; data:pharmacokinetics; Morphine/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine Derivatives/blood/urine; checked:DM","Morphine; Morphine Derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead of the usual  increments of morphine and a benzodiazepine, propofol (4 mg/kg/h) was initiated  at the start of CPB and ceased at CPB separation. Whole blood propofol  concentrations were determined during and postinfusion using high-performance  liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Data from four patients seemed  to fit a two-compartment model, whereas those from seven patients were  significantly (F test, p < 0.05) better fitted to a three-compartment model. The  pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: The mean (SD) of the initial  distribution phase t1/2 pi, intermediate distribution phase t1/2 alpha, and  elimination phase t1/2 beta were 2.22 (1.04) min, 42.9 (16.4) min, and 370 (138)  min, respectively. The mean clearance of 1.31 (0.50) L/min was lower than those  reported from other studies, whereas the mean blood concentration of 2.2 (1.0)  mg/L at the 1-h infusion period was higher. The mean calculated apparent Css was  3.9 (1.5) mg/L. The low clearance is likely to be due to hemodynamic changes  during CPB and CABG, thereby affecting drug distribution and blood flow to the  liver.","1995-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:53:33","","336-341","","4","17","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Lee1995a PMID: 7482686 place: United States","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Singapore; China/ethnology; India/ethnology; *Coronary Artery Bypass; Propofol/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Anesthetics, Intravenous/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Indonesia/ethnology; Malaysia/ethnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The opioid receptor antagonist -naltrexone is often coadministered to  healthy subjects in clinical trials evaluating the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  oxycodone to minimize its pharmacodynamic opioid effects. One objective of this  relative bioavailability trial in healthy subjects was to investigate the effect  of naltrexone on the PK of oxycodone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized,  single-dose, parallel-group, within-groups crossover, clinical trial was  conducted in 24 healthy subjects. 12 subjects were to receive a new oxycodone  prolonged-release (PR) tablet (test) with naltrexone (T+) and without naltrexone  (T) in the fasted state. Additionally, 12 subjects were to receive an Oxygesic PR  tablet (reference) with naltrexone (R+) and without naltrexone (R) in the fasted  state. Naltrexone was given orally 1.5 hours prior to each oxycodone  administration. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability were assessed.  RESULTS: The PK parameters of either oxycodone formulation were not changed with  naltrexone administration under fasted conditions (point estimate T+/T  (corresponding 90% confidence interval): C(max): 103% (88 - 119%), AUC(0-t): 97%  (87 - 108%), AUC: 97% (88 - 108%); point estimate R+/R (corresponding 90%  confidence interval): C(max): 104% (97 - 112%), AUC(0-t): 95% (88 - 102%), AUC:  94% (87 - 100%)). The safety and tolerability of both formulations was not  qualitatively affected by naltrexone coadministration; however, treatment with  naltrexone coadministration showed lower frequencies of adverse events.  CONCLUSION: Oral naltrexone does not affect the PK of oral oxycodone under fasted  conditions. A naltrexone block can be applied in oxycodone PK trials to minimize  adverse opioid effects.","2020-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:49:59","","439-448","","8","58","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Kleideiter2020a PMID: 32507128 place: Germany","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Biological Availability; Delayed-Action Preparations; Analgesics, Opioid; Naltrexone/*administration & dosage; Narcotic Antagonists; Oxycodone/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present experiments, rats were  treated with two, 30-mg naltrexone pellets and the pharmacokinetics and  pharmacodynamics examined. This dosing method produced high plasma naltrexone  levels (350 ng/ml) by 1 hr which declined over an implant period of 192 hr (24  ng/ml). Approximately 40% of the systemically available naltrexone (15.6 mg) was  released in the first 24 hr. A total of 39.8 mg was released over the 192-hr  implantation period. At 192 hr after implantation, naltrexone produced a greater  than 50-fold shift to the right in the dose-response curve for morphine analgesia  relative to placebo-implanted controls. When naltrexone pellets were removed at  192 hr after implantation, morphine analgesia (10 mg/kg) returned with a time  course that was inversely related to the elimination of naltrexone.  Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that naltrexone has a terminal elimination  half-life of 4.6 hr. Probit analysis revealed a linear plasma level-response  relationship for naltrexone antagonism of morphine analgesia with a plasma ED50  of 2.1 ng/ml when plasma morphine levels average 1126 ng/ml. In the rat, s.c.  naltrexone pellets are a dosage form that provides a rapid release of systemic  drug. The systemic availability of naltrexone continues for at least 192 hr after  implantation. The high potency of naltrexone permits continued antagonism of  morphine even when the systemic availability of naltrexone from the pellets has  greatly diminished.","1986-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:22:45","","126-130","","1","237","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Yoburn1986a PMID: 3958962 place: United States","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Drug Implants; Morphine/antagonists & inhibitors/blood; Naltrexone/administration & dosage/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research suggested that intravenously administered  dynorphin A(1-13) has the ability to modulate morphine-induced analgesia. We  designed this study to characterize the disposition of intravenous dynorphin  immunoreactivity in humans and to determine whether concomitant long-term opioid  therapy influenced the pharmacokinetics or side-effects profile of dynorphin  A(1-13). METHODS: The study subjects comprised 20 volunteers divided into two  groups of 10 each, stratified by dose (low dose, 250 micrograms/kg; high dose,  1000 micrograms/kg). There were four volunteers receiving long-term opioid  therapy and six opioid-naive volunteers (nonopioid group) within each dosing  group. Dynorphin A(1-13) was infused over 10 minutes, and arterial blood samples  were drawn and assayed for dynorphin immunoreactivity. A population modeling  approach was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics. Dynorphin effects on  heart rate and arterial blood pressure were also studied. RESULTS: The  pharmacokinetics of dynorphin immunoreactivity were linear over the dose range  studied and were best described by a three-compartment mammillary model whose  parameters were volume 1, 5.0 L; volume 2, 0.80 L; volume 3, 12 L; clearance 1,  6.0 L/min; clearance 2, 0.054 L/min; and clearance 3, 0.044 L/min. Concomitant  opioid medication did not affect the disposition of dynorphin immunoreactivity.  Tachycardia and flushing were commonly observed side effects. The incidence of  side effects was dose dependent and was not influenced by long-term opioid use.  CONCLUSIONS: Intravenously administered dynorphin A(1-13) is very rapidly  metabolized, on the basis of the time course of immunoreactivity in the blood.  Long-term opioid therapy did not influence either the pharmacokinetics or  incidence of side effects.","1998-07","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:35:40","","27-38","","1","64","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Gambus1998a PMID: 9695716 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Drug Interactions; Infusions, Intravenous; Immunoassay; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Dynorphins/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Peptide Fragments/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These results suggest that the enhancement of morphine  antinociception by adrenelectomy can not be explained by the increased morphine  level alone.","1988-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:33:49","","379-386","","4","46","","Jpn J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Miyamoto1988a PMID: 3404768 place: Japan","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Injections, Intravenous; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Injections, Subcutaneous; *Adrenalectomy; Electrochemistry; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; *Analgesics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also,  morphine clearance during the first 5 days of ECMO was studied. DESIGN:  Prospective, open-label study with consecutive patient enrollment. SETTING:  Neonatal intensive care unit at a university-affiliated, children's hospital.  SUBJECTS: Eleven neonates with severe persistent pulmonary hypertension of the  newborn receiving continuous intravenous infusions of morphine sulfate and  requiring ECMO. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were obtained from the subjects and  ECMO circuits at predetermined time intervals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:  Serum morphine concentration was determined using high-performance liquid  chromatography. Morphine concentrations were no different from baseline at 5  mins, 1 hr, or 3 hrs after beginning ECMO. There was no significant difference in  morphine concentration from samples taken immediately proximal and distal to the  membrane oxygenator at 5 mins, 1 hr, and 3 hrs after the start of ECMO. Morphine  clearance was calculated on days 1, 3, and 5 of ECMO. The mean value for morphine  clearance was 11.7 +/- 9.3 (SD) ml/min/kg (range 2.6 to 34.5). CONCLUSIONS: The  initiation of ECMO does not lead to a significant decrease in serum morphine  concentration and there is no uptake of morphine onto the membrane oxygenator of  the ECMO circuit. Morphine clearance for infants receiving ECMO is variable.","1997-02","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:26:51","","360-364","","2","25","","Crit Care Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Geiduschek1997a PMID: 9034277 place: United States","","","","Humans; Prospective Studies; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Infusions, Intravenous; Infant, Newborn; Gestational Age; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Morphine/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Hypertension, Pulmonary/*metabolism/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, in a sheep model of  iliac crest infiltration, we compared the pharmacokinetics of single  administration of plain bupivacaine (100 mg) and bupivacaine (500 mg)-loaded  microspheres. In the clinical control group, pain from the iliac crest was worse  than pain from the primary surgical site. Pain from the iliac crest was  significantly reduced during the first 12 postoperative hours in local  anaesthetic groups compared to the control group. However, during this period,  pain from the primary surgical site was increased compared to the control group.  Finally, there was no difference between the three groups in the average intake  of PCA morphine. There was no significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  difference between plain bupivacaine and ropivacaine. The maximal plasma  concentration (Cmax) of ropivacaine and bupivacaine were 964 (282) ng ml(-1) and  638 (366) ng ml(-1), respectively. In the sheep model, it was clearly shown that  the release of bupivacaine from microspheres was controlled and prolonged despite  the largest dose of bupivacaine used (500 mg; n = 4). Wound infiltration of iliac  crest harvest site with local anaesthetic is an easy technique for postoperative  analgesia. However, this effect lasts only 12 hours without reducing the morphine  consumption due to an increase of pain from the primary surgical site. The local  anaesthetic infiltration produced a significant peak of plasma level, which could  be dangerous if another infiltration or regional anaesthetic technique was  associated with it. Experimentally, as a drug delivery system, the use of local  anaesthetic-loaded microspheres could be an interesting alternative.","2009","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:31:28","","39-45","","1","60","","Acta Anaesthesiol Belg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Estebe2009a PMID: 19459553 place: Belgium","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Animals; Prospective Studies; Double-Blind Method; Sheep; Drug Delivery Systems; Microspheres; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage; Morphine/administration & dosage; Delayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Sodium Chloride/administration & dosage; Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled/methods; Amides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Anesthesia, Local/*methods; Anesthetics, Local/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Bone Transplantation/*methods; Bupivacaine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Extremities/surgery; Ilium/*transplantation; Pain Measurement/statistics & numerical data; Ropivacaine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective, single-center observational trial. SETTING: PICU  in a university-affiliated pediatric teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-one  children with Down syndrome and 17 without, 3-36 months old, scheduled for  cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. INTERVENTIONS: A loading dose of  morphine (100 μg/kg) was administered after coming off bypass; thereafter,  morphine infusion was commenced at 40 μg/kg/hr. During intensive care, nurses  regularly assessed pain and discomfort with validated observational instruments  (COMFORT-Behavior scale and Numeric Rating Scale-for pain). These scores guided  analgesic and sedative treatment. Plasma samples were obtained for  pharmacokinetic analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Median COMFORT-Behavior  and Numeric Rating Scale scores were not statistically significantly different  between the two groups. The median morphine infusion rate during the first 24  hours after surgery was 31.3 μg/kg/hr (interquartile range, 23.4-36.4) in the  Down syndrome group versus 31.7 μg/kg/hr (interquartile range, 25.1-36.1) in the  control group (p = 1.00).

In this study the  pharmacokinetics of two different rectal formulations of morphine were examined  and compared with intravenous morphine. METHODS: Children undergoing elective  surgery received rectal morphine 0.2 mg/kg before start of surgery. Ten children  (mean age 14 months) received morphine rectally in a hydrogel formulation and  another 10 children (mean age 16 months) received morphine rectally in a  parenteral formulation. For comparison, 6 children (mean age 21 months) were  given the same dose intravenously. The plasma concentrations of morphine,  morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) were measured by  HPLC over 6 h after drug administration. RESULTS: The mean rectal bioavailability  of morphine was 35% (range 18-59) after hydrogel administration and 27% (range  6-93) after the solution. Mean values of Cmax were 76 nmol/l (25-129) and 56  nmol/1 (15-140), respectively. The results showed that morphine gel had a  significantly higher bioavailability (P < 0.02) than the solution. The ratios of  plasma (M3G + M6G) to morphine were higher after rectal administration (mean  7.5-8.7) than after i.v. injection (mean 5.3), indicating the presence of  first-pass metabolism using the rectal route. CONCLUSIONS: The rectal morphine  hydrogel has pharmacokinetic properties which makes it a useful formulation for  premedication and pain alleviation in paediatric patients.","1996-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:13:10","","445-451","","4","40","","Acta Anaesthesiol Scand","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Lundeberg1996a PMID: 8738689 place: England","","","","Humans; Child, Preschool; Infant; Administration, Rectal; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 7 subjects in  the study were taking commercially sold MSC 60 mg daily (30 mg twice-daily) prior  to the study and had ""mild"" or ""no"" pain at the start of the study. Plasma  morphine concentrations of PF-402 were longer-lasting and showed smaller  fluctuations than those of MSC. Repeated administration of the same daily doses  of PF-402 and MSC produced similar plasma concentrations for periods of 24 hr and  12 hr. PF-402 administration produced a Tmax of 7.4 hr, and an MRT of 9.8 hr, all  longer than those with MSC. Moreover, no significant difference was observed in  AUC between PF-402 and MSC. These results indicate that the sustained-release  characteristics of PF-402 are superior to those of MSC, and that the two drugs  have a similar absorption pattern. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were observed in  all 7 subjects and consisted of 6 incidences of constipation, 3 incidences of  nausea, 2 incidences of itching, and 1 incidence each of vomiting and somnolence.  Study drug administration was not discontinued in any case due to ADRs, and no  symptoms indicating physical or psychic drug dependence were observed. No  abnormal laboratory values related to study drug administration were observed.  The above results indicate that once-daily administration of PF-402 is sufficient  to maintain plasma concentrations obtained with twice-daily administration of  MSC.

Plasma  morphine concentration-time profiles and changes in PaCO2 were determined after  morphine injection. After morphine injection, the end-tidal anesthetic dose was  manipulated over the course of a 4-h observation period to account for the  decline in plasma morphine concentration and to maintain an anesthetic level  equivalent to 1.0 MAC isoflurane or halothane alone. Morphine decreased the MAC  of halothane and isoflurane. The magnitude of MAC decrease was related to time  after morphine injection and was similar for a given time with both halothane and  isoflurane. For example, at 28.8 +/- 3.6 (mean +/- SE) and 34.8 +/- 6.3 min after  morphine injection, the MAC for halothane and isoflurane were reduced by 35.7%  +/- 4.5% and 39.3% +/- 3.4%, respectively. By 4 h after morphine injection, the  MAC reduction for both anesthetics was less than 10% in most of the animals.

Following establishment of a baseline thermal  threshold, six adult cats were administered 0.1 mg/kg of hydromorphone  intravenously. Thermal threshold testing and blood collection were conducted  simultaneously at predetermined time points. Plasma hydromorphone concentrations  were determined by a liquid chromatographic-mass spectral method and  pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by nonlinear least squares regression  analysis. Plasma hydromorphone concentrations declined rapidly over time, and  were below the limit of quantification of the assay (LOQ = 1.0 ng/mL) by 360 min.  In contrast, thermal thresholds rose from a pretreatment value of 40.9 +/- 0.65  degrees C (mean +/- SEM) to instrument cut-out (55 degrees C) within 15 min and  remained significantly elevated from 15-450 min after treatment. Inspection of  the data revealed no direct correlation between plasma hydromorphone  concentrations and the antinociceptive effect of this drug in cats. These  findings support the importance of conducting pharmacokinetic studies in parallel  with objective measurements of drug effect.","2004-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-12-11 05:49:33","","329-336","","5","27","","J Vet Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Wegner2004a PMID: 15500571 place: England","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Body Temperature/drug effects; Injections, Intravenous/veterinary; Cats/*metabolism; Analgesics/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Hydromorphone/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: Two heroin-dependent patients participating in a  heroin-assisted treatment program received single or repeated doses of 200 - 690  mg DAM i.v., orally (capsules, controlled-release tablets) and rectally. Plasma  and urine profiles of DAM and metabolites were monitored by high-performance  liquid chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, flash and high  effects by visual analog scaling (VAS). RESULTS: DAM was only detectable in  plasma after i.v. administration. With a t 1/2 beta of 1.3 - 2.2 min it was  rapidly desacetylated to 6-acetylmorphine which was further metabolized to  morphine and its 3- and 6-O-glucuronide. Morphine-3-glucuronide was the  dominating metabolite in plasma and urine independent of the administration  route. Oral and rectal doses and dosage intervals were adequate to produce flash  and high effects without any cardiovascular and respiratory side-effects nor  withdrawal symptoms.

However, early  respiratory depression has been reported in patients after relatively large doses  of epidural sufentanil. This has been attributed to systemic drug uptake. We used  a dog model to investigate the pharmacokinetics and rostral spread of epidural  sufentanil in CSF. Sampling catheters were placed in the lumbar subarachnoid  space, the cisterna magna, and femoral arteries of six mongrel dogs. Samples of  cisternal CSF, lumbar CSF, and blood were drawn at 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120,  and 180 min after lumbar epidural sufentanil injection. We measured sufentanil  concentrations by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and used the least squares  method to a fit tri-exponential function to each sufentanil concentration versus  time data set. Paired t-test was used to test for statistical significance. After  epidural sufentanil, lumbar CSF concentrations were significantly higher than  plasma or cisternal CSF sufentanil concentrations at all assessment times.  Sufentanil concentrations were significantly higher in cisternal CSF than in  plasma at 30 and 60 min after injection. Sufentanil appeared rapidly in lumbar  CSF, reaching a maximum concentration (Cmax) of 57 ng/mL at 6.5 min. In cisternal  CSF, a Cmax of 1.2 ng/mL was reached at 21 min, and Cmax in plasma was 0.35 ng/mL  at 6 min.

The two treatments were  separated by a washout period of 7-14 days. Naltrexone was given throughout both  treatment periods to block the opioid effects of hydromorphone. Steady-state  hydromorphone concentrations were statistically analyzed using Helmert contrasts  to determine when steady state was reached. A total of 30 participants were  enrolled, of whom 29 completed both treatment periods. The two treatments  produced comparable steady-state plasma drug concentrations, but peak-to-trough  fluctuations were smaller with OROS hydromorphone (61 percent vs 172 percent) in  comparison with immediate release hydromorphone. Overall systemic exposure to  hydromorphone was similar between the two formulations. The ratio of the  geometric means between the two formulations for the area under the  concentration-time curves at steady state was 105.2 percent with a 90% confidence  interval (CI) of 99.8-110.8 (geometric mean: 102.7 percent; 90% CI: 97.6-108.2  after correcting for measured drug content), which was within the bioequivalence  range (80-125 percent). The analysis of Helmert contrasts showed that steady  state conditions were attained by day 4. Both treatments were well tolerated.

The aim of these experiments was to obtain controlled  morphine tissue concentrations similar to those encountered in fatal human heroin  overdoses. These tissues can be used as a food source for developing fly larvae  in entomotoxicological studies. In the single injection experiment, seven rabbits  were administered 1 or 2 mg/kg body weight of morphine chlorhydrate via the main  ear artery. Blood samples of 200 microL were removed regularly via a catheter.  Morphine concentration was determined using RIA techniques. Morphine was found to  be first rapidly distributed and then slowly eliminated, following a  two-exponential equation. Elimination of morphine from blood can be described as  a two-compartment model. Constants of the equation were determined using the  Kaleidagraph program. Using those constants, the main pharmacokinetics parameters  were calculated. Results of these parameters showed the following: clearance from  13.3 to 16.2 L.h.1, half-life of the distribution phase from 0.6 to 0.9 min, and  half-life of the elimination phase from 21 to 26 min. These results were used to  calculate the rate of perfusion of morphine for rabbits to obtain desired,  controlled, and constant concentrations of morphine in tissues. In the second  experiment, three rabbits received a perfusion of morphine intravascularly at a  rate of 2 mg/kg/h for a period of 3 h. These rabbits were sacrificed and analyses  performed on several abdominal and thoracic organs. Results showed that the  concentrations of morphine differed according to the organ analyzed, but were  reproducible for organs between animals. These concentrations were similar to  those normally encountered in cases of human death due to heroin overdoses.","1999-03","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:44:54","","347-350","","2","44","","J Forensic Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Hedouin1999b PMID: 10097360 place: United States","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Animals; Injections, Intravenous; Tissue Distribution; Infusions, Intravenous; Radioimmunoassay; Rabbits/*metabolism; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Narcotics/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Forensic Medicine/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of damaged veins, many patients administer diacetylmorphine  intramuscularly or orally. Therefore we characterized the pharmacokinetics of  intramuscular and oral diacetylmorphine in the high dose range usually required  in narcotic addicts. METHODS: Three intramuscular doses, 3 oral doses, and 1  intravenous dose of diacetylmorphine and oral and intravenous test doses of  deuterium-labeled morphine (morphine-N-methyl-d3 [morphine-d3]) were administered  to 8 heroin-addicted patients. Arterial plasma concentrations of  diacetylmorphine, monoacetylmorphine, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide,  morphine-6-glucuronide, and morphine-d3 were measured by liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Intramuscularly administered  diacetylmorphine (</=200-250 mg) exhibited linear diacetylmorphine,  monoacetylmorphine, and morphine kinetics and resulted in sustained  diacetylmorphine exposures (bioavailability, 380% +/- 157% [mean +/- SD]) and in  lower and delayed peak monoacetylmorphine and morphine concentrations as compared  with intravenous administration. Oral diacetylmorphine (</=600 mg) yielded  negligible systemic diacetylmorphine and monoacetylmorphine exposures but was  associated with linear kinetics and high bioavailabilities for morphine (67% +/-  19%), morphine-3-glucuronide (205% +/- 52%), and morphine-6-glucuronide (180% +/-  61%). In addition, oral diacetylmorphine was absorbed more rapidly and to a  greater extent than a concomitant test dose of morphine-d3. CONCLUSIONS: On the  basis of the linear pharmacokinetics, the high bioavailability of intramuscular  diacetylmorphine, and the rapid and extended morphine absorption from oral  diacetylmorphine, the intramuscular and oral routes can be recommended as safe  and feasible alternatives to the intravenous route for medical prescription of  diacetylmorphine.","2003-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:38:07","","341-352","","4","74","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Girardin2003a PMID: 14534521 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Injections, Intravenous; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Biological Availability; Injections, Intramuscular; Heroin Dependence/*metabolism; *Heroin/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; *Narcotics/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUBJECTS: In vivo: Forty-four healthy male and female volunteers. METHODS: In  vitro: DETERx capsule contents and marketed comparator tablets were subjected to  manipulation (crushing) using 10 different household utensils.

In addition, the fourth group  received multiple doses (10 g each) of charcoal every 12 h for 84 h. Blood  samples were collected for 96 h and urine for 72 h. Pholcodine concentrations  were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. A significant reduction  in absorption was found when charcoal was administered immediately after  pholcodine; the AUC0-96h was reduced by 91% (p < 0.0005), the Cmax by 77% (p <  0.0005), and the amount of pholcodine excreted into urine by 85% (p < 0.0005).  When charcoal was administered 2 h after pholcodine, the AUC0-96h was reduced by  26% (p = 0.002), the Cmax by 23% (p = NS), and the urinary excretion by 28% (p =  0.004). When administered 5 h after pholcodine, charcoal produced only a 17%  reduction in the AUC0-96h (p = 0.06), but reduced the further absorption of  pholcodine still present in the gastrointestinal tract at the time of charcoal  administration, as measured by AUC5-96h (p = 0.006).

Morphine (21.0 mumol/kg) or M6G (21.7  mumol/kg) were administered s.c. to young adult and aged male Hooded-Wistar rats.  Antinociceptive effect was measured by the tail-flick method at various times up  to 2.5 h or 6.5 h after morphine or M6G administration, respectively, and  concentrations of morphine, morphine-3 beta-glucuronide (M3G) and M6G in plasma  and brain were determined by HPLC. Creatinine clearance was significantly lower  by 33% or 21% in aged compared to young adult rats receiving morphine or M6G,  respectively. After morphine administration, the areas under the (i)  antinociceptive effect-time curve, (ii) plasma morphine concentration-time curve,  and (iii) brain morphine concentration-time curve were not different between  young adult and aged rats. However, the AUC for plasma M3G was five-fold higher  in the aged relative to young adult rats, which could not be accounted for by  only a 33% lower creatinine clearance. M6G was not detected in any plasma or  brain sample from rats administered morphine and no M3G was detected in brain.  For M6G administration, the areas under the (i) antinociceptive effect-time  curve, and (ii) plasma M6G concentration-time curve were 1.8- and 1.6-fold higher  in aged compared to young adult rats, respectively. Concentrations of M6G in  brain were below the limit of quantification. No morphine or M3G was detected in  any of the plasma or brain samples of rats administered M6G. The results  demonstrate no change in morphine antinociception and pharmacokinetics with age,  and suggest that blood-brain barrier permeability and reception sensitivity to  morphine are not altered in aged rats. Accumulation of M3G in plasma of aged rats  is probably due to diminished renal clearance of M3G in addition to a reduction  in the biliary excretion of M3G. The heightened sensitivity of the aged rats to  M6G is probably due to the observed altered kinetics of M6G rather than a  pharmacodynamic change.","1997-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:09:04","","199-205","","2","71","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= VanCrugten1997a PMID: 9211481 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Brain/metabolism; Injections, Subcutaneous; Creatinine/urine; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Aging/*metabolism/*physiology; Morphine Derivatives/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Melanin has affinity for many pharmacologically unrelated drugs and is  responsible for the pigmentation in hair. To assess the role of pigmentation in  the incorporation of drugs into hair, the distribution of codeine and its  metabolites was studied in Sprague-Dawley (SD; white nonpigmented hair), Dark  Agouti (DA; brown pigmented hair), and hooded Long-Evans (LE; both black  pigmented and white nonpigmented hair) rats. Codeine was administered at a dose  of 40 mg/kg/day i.p. for 5 days. Fourteen days after beginning the dosing  protocol, hair was collected and analyzed for codeine, and its metabolite,  morphine, by positive-ion chemical ionization GC/ion-trap MS. The plasma  pharmacokinetics for codeine and morphine were also determined after a single 40  mg/kg injection (equivalent to first dose in 5-day dosing protocol) in all three  strains of rats. Hair and plasma codeine and morphine concentrations were also  determined after acid hydrolysis to evaluate the presence of glucuronide  metabolites. Codeine concentrations in the hair of SD, DA, and pigmented LE hair  were 0.98 +/- 0.10, 5.99 +/- 1.24, and 111.93 +/- 18.69 ng/mg hair, respectively;  morphine concentrations were 0.34 +/- 0.04, 0.51 +/- 0.11, and 14.46 +/- 1.81  ng/mg hair, respectively; morphine glucuronide concentrations were 0.67 +/- 0.08,  1.04 +/- 0.37, and 13.80 +/- 3.60 ng/mg hair, respectively. Studies examining the  in vitro binding of [3H] codeine and [3H]morphine to hair demonstrated both  specific and nonspecific binding sites for codeine and morphine. Pigmented hair  from LE rats possessed the greatest number of binding sites, white hair from SD  rats contained the least, and brown hair from DA rats was intermediate. A time  course study of codeine and its metabolites showed pigment-mediated differences  in incorporation of codeine and metabolites within a few hours of drug  administration. These data indicate that pigmented hair possesses a greater  capacity to bind and incorporate codeine and its metabolites than does  nonpigmented hair. Interpretation of hair concentrations of drugs should involve  consideration of hair pigmentation.","1996-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:42:44","","495-501","","4","24","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Gygi1996b PMID: 8801066 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Half-Life; Morphine/*metabolism; Codeine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Hair/*metabolism; Pigmentation/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphine produced a dose-dependent (2.5 to 10.0 mg/kg) analgesic response as  measured by the tail-flick test. M6G in the same doses as morphine produced a  greater degree of analgesia with longer duration of action. The concentrations of  M6G and morphine were determined in plasma as the protein unbound form after the  use of an equilibrium dialysis technique and in BECF after administration of the  drugs (10.0 mg/kg s.c.). The concentrations of morphine and M6G in BECF were  determined by using microdialysis. The concentration of M6G in plasma and BECF at  each time interval after its administration was much higher than morphine. The  maximal concentrations in plasma and AUC0-infinity values for M6G were, thus,  significantly higher for M6G than for morphine in plasma and BECF. In BECF, the  Tmax value for M6G was lower than for morphine, but the t1/2 beta values did not  differ. In plasma, Tmax and T1/2 values for M6G and morphine did not differ, but  volume of distribution and total clearance values for M6G were lower than for  morphine. It is concluded that per milligram, M6G has a much higher analgesic  potency than morphine in the rat and these differences may be related, in part,  to the higher levels of M6G in comparison to morphine in plasma and BECF.","1995-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:40:24","","852-857","","2","274","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Stain1995a PMID: 7636748 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Brain/*metabolism; Analgesia; Morphine Derivatives/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parenteral heroin provided  measureable blood levels of heroin, 6-acetylmorphine, and morphine. Blood levels  of heroin and 6-acetylmorphine reached their maximal concentrations within  minutes and were cleared rapidly. The mean half-life of heroin (+/- S.D.) after  intravenous injection or infusion was only 3.0 +/- 1.3 minutes, and the mean  clearance of heroin from the blood at apparent steady state was 30.8 +/- 2.1 ml  per kilogram of body weight per minute. Morphine levels rose more gradually, and  morphine was cleared much more slowly. Oral administration of heroin resulted in  measurable blood levels of morphine but not of heroin or 6-acetylmorphine. The  amount of circulating morphine provided by an oral dose of heroin was only 79 per  cent of that available from an equal amount of morphine. We conclude that heroin  is a pro-drug that serves to determine the distribution of its active  metabolites. Parenteral heroin is rapidly converted to 6-acetylmorphine, which  contributes to rapid pain relief. Oral heroin is converted to morphine and  appears to be an inefficient means of providing morphine to the systemic  circulation.","1984-05-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:08:12","","1213-1217","","19","310","","N Engl J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Inturrisi1984a PMID: 6709027 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Administration, Oral; Half-Life; Injections, Intravenous; Biological Availability; Pain/*drug therapy; Chronic Disease; Injections, Intramuscular; Infusions, Parenteral; Morphine Derivatives/blood; Morphine/blood; Heroin/administration & dosage/*blood; Pain, Intractable/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective, open-label,  observational study. SETTING: Canadian, university-based renal program.  PARTICIPANTS: Twelve anuric hemodialysis patients with chronic pain, established  on immediate-release HM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HM and H3G plasma concentrations  were measured during and between hemodialysis treatments using a reverse-phase  high-performance liquid chromatography assay with liquid chromatography/mass  spectrometer/mass spectrometer detection. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and  a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to measure pain. Noncompartmental  analyses were conducted. Adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: HM did not  substantially accumulate (accumulation factor R = 2.7 (1.6)), most likely due to  the rapid conversion to H3G. Conversely, H3G accumulated between dialysis  treatments (R = 12.5 (12.1)) but appeared to be effectively removed during  hemodialysis (1.8 (0.7), p = 0.03). HM resulted in > 65 percent reduction in pain  over dosing intervals. Mean MPQ pain scores decreased from 39.8 (18.2) to 12.3  (16.2) on dialysis and from 35.0 (18.5) to 15.5 (13.6) between dialysis  treatments. Mean VAS pain scores decreased from 7.5 (2.5) to 3.0 (1.5) on  dialysis and from 5.9 (3.2) to 4.4 (1.6) between dialysis treatments. No  clinically significant opioid toxicity was observed. The accumulation of H3G  between hemodialysis treatments was associated with greater sensory-type pain (r  = 0.76, p < 0.0001) and reduced duration of analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: HM may be a  safe and effective opioid for use in selected hemodialysis patients.","2008-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:18:58","","335-6, 339-344","","6","4","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Davison2008a PMID: 19192761 place: United States","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Renal Dialysis; Chronic Disease; Analgesics, Opioid/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Glucuronates/*blood; Hydromorphone/*analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*therapy; Pain/classification/*drug therapy/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peak plasma levels and distribution phase half-lives for dl-, l- and d-KC were  similar, indicating no major dispositional differences between the isomers of KC  despite a trend for d-KC to have a longer elimination half-life, slower plasma  clearance and a greater apparent volume of distribution than l-KC. Although a  relatively low dose of naltrexone (0.01 mg/kg) was sufficient to shift morphine  dose-effect curves to the right, this dose of naltrexone was not sufficient to  shift the dose-effect curves of dl-KC to the right. A dose of 1 mg/kg of  naltrexone was required, consistent with the view that the effects were mediated  by kappa opioid receptors. The overall pharmacological profile of l-KC differed  from that of the more selective kappa opioid agonist U-50,488H, which produced  both stimulatory and sedative effects. Neither l-KC nor U-50,488H produced  pharmacological profiles typical of the sigma agonist d-N-allylnormetazocine or  phencyclidine. The data suggest that the pharmacological activity of KC resides  in the l-enantiomer, that the effects are kappa opioid receptor-mediated and that  the binding of d-KC to haloperidol-sensitive sigma receptors does not produce  N-allylnormetazocine- or phencyclidine-like actions in the dog.","1991-01","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:25:14","","211-221","","1","256","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Vaupel1991a PMID: 1846414 place: United States","","","","Female; Animals; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Dogs; Stereoisomerism; Receptors, sigma; Behavior, Animal/drug effects; Naltrexone/pharmacology; 3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide, (trans)-Isomer; Analgesics/pharmacology; Ethylketocyclazocine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Morphine/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology; Pyrrolidines/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, kappa; Receptors, Opioid/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the relationship between incorporation and dose or time  course of plasma concentrations is poorly defined. The purpose of this study was  to compare plasma and hair concentrations of codeine and its metabolites after  various doses of codeine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats had a 1"" x 1"" square shaved  from their backs. Codeine was administered by intraperitoneal injection (10, 20,  40, or 60 mg/kg/day) daily for 5 days. Fourteen days after beginning drug  administration, the original patch was reshaved and newly grown hair was analyzed  for codeine and morphine using GC/MS. The mean concentrations of codeine in hair  for the 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day groups were 0.29, 0.57, 0.96, and 1.93 ng/mg  hair, respectively, and the concentrations of morphine were 0.15, 0.28, 0.49, and  0.79 ng/mg hair, respectively. The plasma concentration time courses for codeine  and morphine were determined after single doses of either 20 or 40 mg/kg. Peak  plasma codeine concentrations for the 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 1,441 and 2,452  ng/ml plasma, respectively, and the areas under the plasma concentration vs. time  curve were 699 and 1,581 ng-hr/ml, respectively. Morphine glucuronide, but not  codeine glucuronide, was measured in the hair of rats administered codeine.  Codeine was also administered to rats by constant intravenous infusion (40  mg/kg/day for 5 days). The concentration of codeine in rat hair after this route  of administration was 2.92 +/- 0.72 ng/mg hair. Codeine and morphine are  incorporated into rat hair in a dose-proportional fashion.

Decrement curves of naloxone were compared with those after  iv injection of morphine (5 mg/kg). Serum concentration of naloxone at 5 minutes  was 1.45 +/- 0.1 mug/ml (mean +/- SE) and that of morphine was 1.0 +/- 0.08  mug/ml. Their serum half-lives from one to four hours were approximately the  same, 30-40 minutes. With naloxone, the brain-serum concentration ratios ranged  from 2.7 to 4.6. Concentration of naloxone in the brain declined parallel to that  in the serum. However, with morphine the initial brain concentration was  approximately one tenth that in the serum (0.096 +/- 0.04 mug/ml). The brain  morphine concentration was sustained for one hour, while serum morphine  concentrations declined from 1.0 to 0.19 mug/ml during this period. Two minutes  after iv injection of naloxone HCl (0.4 mg) in nine healthy volunteers, the serum  drug concentration was 0.01 +/- .001 mug/ml. At 5 minutes, 97 per cent of the  administered dose was no longer found in the serum, the serum concentration being  0.004 +/- .0003 mug/ml. From 20 minutes to two hours after injection, the  calculated mean serum half-life of naloxone was 64 minutes. These results suggest  that the rapid penetrance of naloxone into the brain and the high brain-serum  concentration ratio contribute to its rapid onset of action and potency as a  narcotic antagonist. The rapid decline of naloxone concentration in the brain  found in the animal model, in contrast to that of morphine, could be the basis  for its relatively short duration of action.","1976-05","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:04:36","","398-401","","5","44","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Ngai1976a PMID: 1267205 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Middle Aged; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Half-Life; Lipids; Solubility; Brain/metabolism; *Anesthesia, Intravenous; Morphine/metabolism/pharmacology; Naloxone/metabolism/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All  patients had both clinical and radiological evidence of metastatic spread of  their cancer and there were no significant differences in age, weight and sites  of the primary cancer between the methadone (n = 9) and morphine (n = 9) groups.  Blood opioid concentration, visual analogue pain scores (VAPS) and end-tidal  percent carbon dioxide were measured before and after both an intravenous and  oral dose of either methadone or morphine. Terminal half-lives (mean +/- S.D.)  were 30.4 +/- 16.3 h and 2.7 +/- 1.2 h respectively for methadone and morphine  while the clearance values (mean +/- S.D.) were 0.19 +/- 0.13 l/min and 1.16 +/-  0.47 l/min. The long half-life of methadone was associated with prolonged pain  relief. However, the large variation in the half-life of methadone necessitated  careful adjustment of the dosing interval in individual patients. There were  pronounced differences in oral bioavailability between the two opioids:  methadone, 79 +/- 11.7%, compared to morphine, 26 +/- 13% (mean +/- S.D.). Of  greater clinical significance was the variability in these bioavailability  estimates with a coefficient of variation of 15% for methadone compared to 50%  for morphine. The combined effects of low and variable oral bioavailability for  morphine may result in sub-therapeutic doses being administered as practitioners  may be inhibited by the size of the effective oral morphine dose and may be  confused by the variability in this dose compared to intramuscular doses. The  initial oral dose of morphine varied from 15 mg 4 hourly to 150 mg 3 hourly,  while the initial dose for methadone varied from 15 mg on alternate nights to 20  mg twice daily. There was no rapid escalation of daily opioid dose for either  methadone or morphine when adequate pain control was provided rapidly at the  start of treatment by the technique described in this study.","1986-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:40:33","","297-312","","3","25","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Gourlay1986a PMID: 3528988 place: United States","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Clinical Trials as Topic; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Half-Life; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Biological Availability; Drug Administration Schedule; Random Allocation; Infusions, Parenteral; Neoplasms/*physiopathology; Methadone/blood/*therapeutic use; Morphine/blood/*therapeutic use; Pain/blood/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Male Sprague-Dawley rats received po or iv doses  of each drug equivalent to 10 mg/kg free base. Blood samples were collected at  various times over the 6-hr period after each drug administration, and plasma  concentrations of the parent drugs and metabolically produced morphine were  determined. A single ethylmorphine antiserum was used for analysis of codeine,  ethylmorphine, t-butylmorphine, and pholcodine in separate experiments, whereas a  specific morphine antiserum was used in the radioimmunoassay of this compound.  The absolute oral bioavailabilities of morphine, codeine, ethylmorphine, and  t-butylmorphine all were below 10%, whereas that of pholcodine was over 40%.  Terminal half-lives of morphine, codeine, ethylmorphine, and t-butylmorphine  after iv administration all were less than 45 min, while that of pholcoline was  over 2 hr. Codeine, ethylmorphine, t-butylmorphine, and pholcodine did not appear  to undergo conjugation, as evidenced by the similarity between areas under the  curve for total (unconjugated plus conjugated) and parent (unconjugated) drugs.  Amounts of metabolically produced morphine in rats treated with codeine,  ethylmorphine, t-butylmorphine, or pholcodine differed markedly. After oral  administration, presystemic O-dealkylation of codeine and ethylmorphine was much  greater than that of t-butylmorphine or pholcodine, presumably due to the  presence of much bulkier 3-alkyl substituents in the latter compounds. Thus, the  ratio of the morphine AUC to that of parent drug after po administration was 1.37  for codeine and 1.60 for ethylmorphine, but only 0.08 for t-butylmorphine and  0.01 for pholcodine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1983-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:23:26","","481-488","","5","11","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Butz1983a PMID: 6138235 place: United States","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Rats, Inbred Strains; Dealkylation; Radioimmunoassay; Cross Reactions; Morphine/metabolism; *Morphine Derivatives/metabolism; Codeine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Ethylmorphine/metabolism; Handling, Psychological; Morpholines/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such changes have the potential to alter drug metabolism. There are few studies  describing drug disposition in acute trauma. We determined the pharmacokinetics  of an intermediate extraction drug, morphine, in trauma patients. Nine patients  with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > or = 16 were studied within 48 hours of  trauma. Morphine 5 mg was given intravenously and serial blood and urine samples  were drawn to derive pharmacokinetic parameters. Alpha acid glycoprotein (AAG)  levels were determined. Total morphine clearance (CL) and volume of distribution  (Vss) were decreased compared to established literature values. Area under the  curve (AUC) and terminal half-life (T 1/2 alpha) were increased. AAG levels were  higher than reference range. Elimination half-life was increased. The decrease we  observed in Vss may be attributed to increased binding of morphine by AAG, which  is increased after trauma as in our patients. Decreased clearance and increased  half-life of an intermediate extraction drug may be explained by increased  protein binding, decreased liver blood flow, and reduced hepatocellular function.  Decreased clearance of the magnitude observed in these patients could result in  drug accumulation. Better understanding of the effects of trauma on the  pharmacokinetics of low, high, and intermediate extraction drugs will prevent  excessive or suboptimal drug dosing.","1995-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:42:40","","749-752","","4","39","","J Trauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Christie1995a PMID: 7473969 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Protein Binding; Half-Life; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Drug Monitoring; Tissue Distribution; Acute Disease; Liver/blood supply/metabolism; Morphine/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Injury Severity Score; Multiple Trauma/drug therapy/*metabolism; Orosomucoid/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  pharmacokinetics of codeine were determined from the respective plasma and urine  concentrations. Before the administration of rifampin, the pharmacodynamic  effects of codeine were more prominent in the EMs (P < .01). Rifampin  significantly enhanced codeine oral clearance by increasing its metabolic  clearances through N-demethylation and glucuronidation in both phenotypes, but  its O-demethylation was induced only in EMs. Relative to base-line values,  codeine N-demethylation was induced to a greater extent, resulting in a marked  reduction in the plasma concentrations of codeine and codeine metabolites and  elevated plasma concentrations of norcodeine, norcodeine-glucuronide, and  normorphine. The reduction in morphine plasma concentration was associated in the  EMs with a significant attenuation of codeine's respiratory and psychomotor  effects, whereas its miotic effect was unaltered. In PMs, codeine's respiratory  and psychomotor effects were unaltered by rifampin, but its pupillary effect was  reduced. Codeine O-demethylation to produce morphine can be significantly induced  by rifampin, but this induction is phenotypically determined. However, because  (relative to base-line values) rifampin enhanced codeine N-demethylation more  than codeine O-demethylation, morphine plasma concentrations were reduced-and  hence codeine's pharmacodynamic effects were attenuated-in EMs of debrisoquin.","1997-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:12:16","","330-336","","1","281","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Caraco1997a PMID: 9103514 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Drug Interactions; Pharmacogenetics; Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects; Dealkylation; Debrisoquin/*metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/physiology; Rifampin/*pharmacology; Respiration/*drug effects; Narcotics/*pharmacology; Codeine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Miotics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We define dosing rules for a loading dose  followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of morphine sulfate to achieve a  serum morphine concentration of 75 micrograms/L. This concentration is well above  the minimum serum morphine concentration of 50 micrograms/L for moderate  analgesic effects in adults. It also exceeds the concentration of 65 micrograms/L  claimed to provide adequate analgesia in children during surgery. The clearance  of morphine in 8 children between 0 and 5 yr of age was 20.5 +/- 2.8 mL/kg/min  (means +/- SD). This result is threefold larger than the clearance value obtained  after a single intravenous dose and 1.5 times greater than clearance values found  after multiple intravenous doses of morphine, previously reported by others in  children between the ages of 1 and 15 yr. Having established a dosing regimen  that achieves a steady-state serum morphine concentration of approximately 75  micrograms/L, we plan to investigate the relationship between morphine serum  concentration and pharmacologic effect. Intraoperatively the action of morphine  at its receptor site will be assessed according to a scoring system including EEG  changes, heart rate, blood pressure, response to sensory stimuli, and maintenance  of vital functions. The effect of intravenous morphine will further be estimated  according to the postanesthetic scoring system described in this report. Using  intraoperative and postanesthetic scores to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of  morphine for anesthesia in relation to morphine serum concentration will lead to  a better understanding and improvement in use of intravenous morphine in young  children.","1983","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-12-11 05:56:24","","887-903","","5","14","","Drug Metab Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Vandenberghe1983a PMID: 6653402 place: England","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Postoperative Period; Child, Preschool; Infant; *Anesthesia, Intravenous; Morphine/administration & dosage/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The parent drug and  glucuronide metabolites were measured simultaneously using high-performance  liquid chromatography (HPLC) and native fluorescence detection. The mean morphine  area under the curve (AUC) value (0-8 h) was smaller (434.3 +/- 170.2 nmolL(-1)h)  in the oral administration than in the rectal administration (574.8 +/- 285.0  nmolL(-1)h) (p < 0.05).

The median AUC ratio--M3G/M and M6G/M, 12.58 and  1.85--following MSR rectal administration was smaller than following MST oral  administration in 6 patients (19.97 and 2.59; p < 0.05), whereas the median AUC  ratio M3G/M6G in the rectal dosing was 6.24 (range 5.2-7.6) was almost the same  as the median ratio M3G/M6G in the oral dosing was 6.49 (range 5.8-8.5; p > 0.1).  Four of the 6 patients had a greater Cmax of M3G and M6G after oral  administration than after rectal administration. The same 4 had lower fluctuation  rates for morphine, M3G (p < 0.05), and M6G (p < 0.05) after rectal  administration.

METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved, prospective  crossover study of ten healthy human volunteers ingesting 5 grams of APAP, 5  grams of APAP + 250 mg of DPH (APAP+DPH), or 5 grams of APAP + 0.5 mg/kg of OXY  (APAP+OXY). Serum APAP concentrations (APAPs) were measured hourly from zero  through eight hours and again at 24 hours, and basic noncompartmental  pharmacokinetic parameters were compared. RESULTS: For APAP alone, the mean  parameters were: maximum APAP concentration ([APAP](max)) 71.8 microg/mL, time to  peak [APAP] (t(max)) 1.71 hours, and area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUC(0-8)) 318.3 microg-hr/mL. For APAP+DPH, the mean  parameters were: [APAP](max) 67.6 microg/mL, t(max) 1.90 hours, and AUC(0-8)  297.7 microg-hr/mL. For APAP+OXY, the parameters were: [APAP](max) 42.9  microg/mL, t(max) 2.87 hours, and AUC(0-8) 232.1 microg-hr/mL. Compared with APAP  alone, APAP+OXY had a 27% lower AUC, a 40% lower [APAP](max), and a 68% longer  t(max). Co-ingested DPH had no significant effect on APAP absorption, except a 6%  decrease in the AUC. CONCLUSIONS: Co-ingested OXY, but not DPH, delayed  absorption of APAP.

Interestingly, 24 hr after morphine administration (when antinociception and  morphine blood levels were no longer detectable) these parameters underwent a  marked reduction. Similarly, macrophage-mediated inhibition of tumor cells  proliferation was first stimulated (at 20 and 40 min) and then depressed (at 24  hr). Splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity, determined by standard 51Cr  release from YAC-1 target cells, also was evaluated. No differences in natural  killer activity was observed at any of the monitored time points. In addition, we  evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of an acute injection of methadone (a  synthetic narcotic compound) at a dose inducing the same degree of analgesia as  morphine. None of the tested immunoparameters were affected by the administration  of methadone, which indicates the different drug-sensitivity of immunological  correlates in vivo.","1994-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:06:39","","1112-1116","","3","269","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Pacifici1994a PMID: 8014855 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Respiratory Burst/drug effects; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects; Immunity/*drug effects; Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects; Methadone/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Neutrophils/drug effects/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was no interethnic difference in the metabolism to  normorphine. Morphine depressed the respiratory response to rebreathing carbon  dioxide more in white subjects than in Chinese subjects, resulting in a greater  reduction in resting ventilation and resting end-tidal PCO2. The slope of the  ventilation/PCO2 response curve, a measure of carbon dioxide sensitivity, was  reduced more in white subjects than Chinese subjects. As a result, white subjects  had a greater depression in ventilation at a PCO2 of 55 mm Hg.

Pretreatment with GF120918 increased both the area  under the concentration-time curve of unbound morphine in brain extracellular  fluid (ECF) and morphine-associated antinociception. The area under the  concentration-time curve ratio for unbound morphine in brain ECF versus unbound  morphine in blood was significantly higher in GF120918-treated rats compared with  control rats (1.21 +/- 0.34 versus 0.47 +/- 0.05, respectively; p <.05).  Modulation of morphine brain-blood distribution was confirmed by quantitating  brain tissue morphine in a separate group of rats; GF120918 increased the brain  tissue:serum concentration ratio approximately 3-fold.

Plasma morphine  and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) concentrations interpolated to the average time  of minimal respiratory rate indicated decreases of 23%+/-13% (0%-79%) and 1%+/-9%  (0%-32%) from their respective starting values. Plasma M6G concentrations were  significantly different from baseline only 420 and 480 min after the  administration of diclofenac. The potential opioid-sparing effects of a  nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug added during PCA morphine use may not be  manifest for several hours. During this lag, plasma concentrations of M6G may  reach and remain at levels high enough to increase the risk of respiratory  depression and other opioid side effects for hours. IMPLICATIONS: Plasma  concentrations of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, and diclofenac were measured  postoperatively after a single dose of rectal diclofenac 100 mg was added to  morphine patient-controlled analgesia. Peak analgesia occurred 309 min and  respiratory depression 197 min after diclofenac administration. Morphine  consumption had decreased by 20%, but concentrations of the active metabolite  morphine-6-glucuronide were unchanged. Vigilance is recommended in patients  receiving patient-controlled analgesia opioids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory  drugs.","1999-05","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-12-11 05:59:19","","1137-1142","","5","88","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Tighe, Tighe1999a PMID: 10320184 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Drug Interactions; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy; Administration, Rectal; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology; Respiration/drug effects; *Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Morphine Derivatives/*blood; Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects; Diclofenac/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology; Morphine/*adverse effects/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The duration of pain was  usually less than 24 h (mean 20.9+/-0.55 h), and only 24.8% of patients  experienced chest pain of longer duration. The majority of patients had only one  attack of pain, but 34.4% experienced four or more attacks during  hospitalization. A mean morphine dose of 6.7+/-0.2 mg was administered over the 3  hospitalization days, but surprisingly 52.4% of all patients required no morphine  analgesia at all. Independent predictors of an increased morphine consumption  were initial degree of suspicion of acute myocardial infarction, ST changes on  admission ECG, male sex, a history of angina pectoris and a history of congestive  heart failure. In a separate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study in 10  patients, plasma concentrations of morphine and its major metabolites,  morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), were measured  after intravenous administration of morphine. In this patient group, terminal  half-life of unchanged morphine ranged from 0.77 to 3.22 h. M3G and M6G plasma  concentrations increased gradually up to 60-90 min after the intravenous morphine  injection. Initial pain intensity by numerical rating scale was 6.6+/-0.6  (arbitrary units), and after morphine administration, there was a rapid and  significant decrease in pain intensity. After 20 min, pain relief was 69+/-11%  and remained at this level during the following 8 h observation period. It is  concluded that the need for morphine administration in patients with suspected or  definite acute myocardial infarction, differs among subgroups of patients and, in  particular, higher doses are needed in those with a strong suspicion of  myocardial infarction at arrival. When intravenous morphine is given, it attains  full effect 20 min after injection. Furthermore, the active morphine metabolites  M3G and M6G appear rapidly in the circulation, which could influence the  analgesic response to morphine treatment.

METHODS: Single oral codeine doses (60 and  120 mg/70 kg) were administered to 19 volunteers. Oral fluid and plasma were  analyzed for free codeine, norcodeine, morphine, and normorphine by solid-phase  extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE/GC-MS).  Physiologic and subjective effects were examined. RESULTS: Mean (SE) peak codeine  concentrations were 214.2 +/- 27.6 and 474.3 +/- 77.0 micro g/L in plasma and  638.4 +/- 64.4 and 1599.3 +/- 241.0 micro g/L in oral fluid. The oral  fluid-to-plasma ratio for codeine was relatively constant ( approximately 4) from  1 to 12 h. The mean half-life (t(1/2)) of codeine was 2.2 +/- 0.10 h in plasma  and 2.2 +/- 0.16 h in oral fluid. Significant dose-related miosis and increases  in sedation, psychotomimetic effect, and ""high"" occurred after the high dose.  Mean codeine oral fluid detection time was 21 h with a 2.5 microg/L cutoff,  longer than that of plasma (12-16 h). Detection times with the proposed Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration cutoff (40 microg/L) were only 7  h. Norcodeine, but not morphine or normorphine, was quantified in both plasma and  oral fluid. CONCLUSIONS: The disposition of codeine over time was similar in  plasma and oral fluid, but because of high variability, oral fluid codeine  concentrations did not reliably predict concurrent plasma concentrations. Oral  fluid testing is a useful alternative matrix for monitoring codeine exposure with  a detection window of 7-21 h for single doses, depending on cutoff  concentrations. These controlled drug administration data should aid in the  interpretation of oral fluid codeine results.","2002-09","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:49:38","","1486-1496","","9","48","","Clin Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Kim2002a PMID: 12194925 place: England","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Administration, Oral; Specimen Handling; Substance Abuse Detection/*methods; Pupil/drug effects; *Mouth; Body Fluids/chemistry/*metabolism; Codeine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Narcotics/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because these fluids may be administered to trauma victims, the pharmacokinetics  of morphine was studied in rats after transfusion with one of these fluids.  During development of high-performance liquid chromatography assay for morphine  in plasma, an in vitro interaction between plasma, Fluosol DA, or stroma-free  hemoglobin and morphine was observed at pH greater than 10.5. This interaction  was dependent on pH and was specific to morphine, compared with codeine. The  interaction between stroma-free hemoglobin and morphine appeared to be covalent  in nature. The t1/2 of morphine was significantly prolonged from 1.02 +/- 0.50  hours (mean +/- SD) to 2.46 +/- 2.68 hours (p = 0.03) after transfusion with  stroma-free hemoglobin, and to 2.05 +/- 0.95 hours (p = 0.006) after transfusion  with Fluosol DA. The volume of distribution was increased from 1.35 +/- 0.81 L X  kg-1 to 2.99 +/- 1.45 L X kg-1 (p = 0.004) after transfusion with stroma-free  hemoglobin; no such difference was observed after transfusion with fluosol DA (p  = 0.86). The area under the time-concentration curve was increased from 2.37 +/-  1.78 mg X hr X L-1 to 6.02 +/- 6.61 mg X hr X L-1 (p = 0.02), and total body  clearance was decreased from 1.02 +/- 0.53 L X hr-1 X kg-1 to 0.55 +/- 0.36 L X  hr-1 X kg-1 (p = 0.01) after transfusion with Fluosol DA. No significant  differences were observed in these parameters after transfusion with stroma-free  hemoglobin (p = 0.48 and p = 0.81, respectively). These data show that  stroma-free hemoglobin prolongs the t1/2 of morphine by altering the volume of  distribution. In contrast, Fluosol DA prolongs the t1/2 of morphine by altering  the total body clearance. These data may have important therapeutic implications.","1984-09","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:49:05","","433-444","","3","104","","J Lab Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Kemner1984a PMID: 6470567 place: United States","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Drug Interactions; Half-Life; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Resuscitation; Morphine/blood/*metabolism; *Hemoglobins; Fluorocarbons/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hyoscine 0.006 mg kg-1 and morphine 0.20 mg kg-1 were administered  intramuscularly as routine premedication. Surgery was performed using high-dose  fentanyl anaesthesia (100 micrograms kg-1). The clinical responses followed were  heart rate, blood pressure, subjective sedation and antisialogogue effect. The  plasma hyoscine levels were determined by radioreceptor assay, and plasma  morphine levels by liquid chromatography, both up to 24 h. The maximum levels of  plasma hyoscine (6.6 micrograms l-1) and morphine (158 micrograms l-1) and the  time they were reached (13.0 and 9.7 min, respectively) were comparable with the  values obtained in earlier studies using young healthy subjects. After the start  of cardiopulmonary bypass, significant decreases in plasma levels of both  hyoscine and morphine were found. The elimination half-life of hyoscine in the  plasma was 2.4 h, which is somewhat greater than obtained in earlier studies with  young healthy patients under regional anaesthesia. Elimination of plasma morphine  (t1/2el = 3.3 h) was not significantly altered by the procedure. The sedative and  antisialogogue effects of the drugs appeared quickly and were significant, but no  tachycardia or other side effects were observed. In conclusion, the kinetic  properties of both hyoscine and morphine are suitable for routine use as  premedicants before cardiac surgery.","1991-03","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:49:13","","135-140","","2","8","","Eur J Anaesthesiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Kentala1991a PMID: 1874209 place: England","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Half-Life; Heart Rate/drug effects; Injections, Intramuscular; Conscious Sedation; *Coronary Artery Bypass; *Preanesthetic Medication; Anesthesia, Intravenous; *Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Morphine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Salivation/drug effects; Scopolamine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Beagle dogs were  prepared with lumbar epidural catheters with subcutaneous injection ports and  lumbar intrathecal catheters. Each dog (n = 6) received the following by the  epidural route: 5 mg/3 ml morphine sulfate in saline (MS-5), 10 mg/3 ml C0401  (C0401-10), and 30 mg/3 ml C0401 (C0401-30). Behavioral and physiologic  parameters and nociceptive responses (skin twitch latency) were evaluated, and  morphine concentrations were determined in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid and serum.  RESULTS: All morphine treatments blocked the skin twitch response. Time to onset  was 1.3 +/- 0.3 h for C0401-30; 2.6 +/- 0.6 h for C0401-10; and 0.4 +/- 0.2 h for  MS-5. Duration of action was 62 +/- 0.3 h for C0401-30; 27 +/- 2 h for MS-5. All  treatments produced a modest reduction in arousal, muscle tone, and coordination,  with the duration of the C0401-30 preparation being longer lasting. Respiratory  rate was mildly depressed by all treatments, and moderate hypotension was noted.  Time to peak cerebrospinal fluid morphine concentration was 11 h for C0401-30; 3  h for C0401-10; and 5 min for MS-5. Peak lumbar cerebrospinal fluid level was  34,992 +/- 5,578 ng/ml for MS-5; 14,483 +/- 3,438 ng/ml for C0401-30; and 10,730  +/- 2,888 ng/ml for C0401-10. Morphine mean residence time in lumbar  cerebrospinal fluid was 0.8 +/- 0.1 h for MS-5; 8.9 +/- 1.0 h for C0401-30.  DISCUSSION: Kinetics studies showed that multivesicular liposome sequestration  results in a restrained and persistent release of morphine from the epidural  space. This extended release corresponded with an extended duration of analgesia  without an attendant increase in the incidence of side effects.","1999-05","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:22:17","","1402-1412","","5","90","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Yaksh1999a PMID: 10319789 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Dogs; Body Temperature/drug effects; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Delivery Systems; Liposomes; Respiration/drug effects; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Epidural Space/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  investigated the acidic hydrolysis of M6G and found that the recovery of morphine  did not exceed 5%. The stability of M6G was studied in different physiological  compartments of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The formation of morphine after M6G  incubation in feces was under 2% in the small intestine, whereas the formation of  morphine in colon feces represented 85.6 +/- 12.9% of the initial concentration  of M6G. The stability of M6G was also determined ex vivo using the isolated  perfused rat liver. The hepatic extraction ratio of M6G was very low (0.04 +/-  0.02), but 88. 7 +/- 11.2% of the dose was excreted in bile. The elimination  half-life of M6G in the perfusate (66.4 +/- 20.6 min) was higher than the  elimination half-life in bile (18.6 +/- 2.5 min). The hydrolysis of M6G was low,  with only 7.7% and 0.03% of morphine in the perfusate and bile, respectively. The  perfusate level of morphine 3-glucuronide (M3G) resulting from morphine  conjugation was 4.9 +/- 3.6%. An in vivo experiment demonstrated that after oral  administration, M6G was absorbed per se in the proximal intestine, and the  process was prolonged over the 24-hr experiment due to its reabsorption following  enterohepatic recirculation. Finally, 10.5 +/- 4.3% of morphine and 12.9 +/- 5.1%  of M3G compared with M6G AUCs were found in plasma. These results show that M6G  is weakly converted into morphine when orally absorbed, with a kinetic profile  similar to a slow release formulation.","1998-05","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:29:53","","383-387","","5","26","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Stain-Texier1998a PMID: 9571218 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; In Vitro Techniques; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Hydrolysis; Liver/metabolism; *Intestinal Absorption; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine Derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Thirty HIV-seropositive  L-methadone-substituted i.v. drug abusers (stage CDC/WHO B2 - 3 with CD4+-counts  ranging from 65 to 293/microl) were randomized into 3 groups (A - C). Ten  patients were treated with fusidic acid 500 mg/day over a period of 14 (group A)  or 28 days (group B), respectively. Patients in group C served as a control group  and did not receive any medication apart from L-methadone. In order to  investigate the hepatic monooxygenase system, pharmacokinetics were determined in  all patients before initiation and 14 and 28 days after starting therapy with  fusidic acid. The concentration of antipyrine and its 3 main metabolites  (norantipyrine (NORA), 4-hydroxyantipyrine (OHA), 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine  (HMA)) in plasma and urine were measured by high-performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: No effects on antipyrine pharmacokinetics and  pharmacokinetics of antipyrine metabolites were found in group A after 14 days of  fusidic acid intake and in the control group without therapy. However, in  contrast an activation of the CYP450 enzyme system was observed in group B after  28 days of fusidic acid therapy with an increase of total antipyrine clearance  (43.0 +/- 7.62 ml/min to 51.0 +/- 9.03 ml/min) as well as clearances to all  metabolites (NORA 7.11 +/- 1.75 to 8.60 +/-2.10 ml/min, OHA 11.5 +/- 2.89 to 14.0  +/- 3.97 ml/min, HMA 4.05 +/- 0.99 to 4.94 +/- 1.27 ml/min). Antipyrine half-life  was significantly reduced (12.3 +/- 2.8 h to 9.4 +/- 2.2 h) and some patients  developed clinical signs of L-methadone underdosage. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  suggest that fusidic acid has a time-dependent activating effect on the CYP450  enzyme system. Especially in treatment of patients who are frequently under  multidrug regimens such as HIV-positive patients drug interactions should be  taken into consideration.","1999-11","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:10:06","","562-566","","11","37","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Reimann1999a PMID: 10584978 place: Germany","","","","Humans; Time Factors; Drug Interactions; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*drug effects/metabolism; Liver/*drug effects/enzymology; Enzyme Activation/drug effects; HIV Seropositivity/*enzymology; Narcotics/therapeutic use; Anti-Bacterial Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Antipyrine/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Fusidic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Methadone/therapeutic use; Morphine Dependence/*enzymology/rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clearance (CL) was estimated as 148 +/- 58 ml/min*kg  after the bolus dose and 108 +/- 32 ml/min*kg during infusion (N.S.). Tolerance  developed during the first day of morphine infusion and no antinociceptive effect  could be measured from the third day. After cessation of the infusions, rebound  hyperalgesia, significant for the higher infusion rate (P < .05), was observed.  No hyperalgesia was detected after the bolus dose. A pharmacodynamic model with  separate effect and tolerance compartments was used to describe the  antinociceptive effect over time. The rates of equilibration of drug between the  blood and effect compartment and the blood and tolerance compartment, expressed  in half-lives, were estimated as 25 +/- 8 min and 26 +/- 6 hr, respectively. It  is apparent from these results that an i.v. bolus dose of morphine causes less  tolerance than constant rate infusions of morphine. With the presented model it  is possible to quantify the rate and extent of tolerance development of morphine.","1993-07","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:30:35","","244-252","","1","266","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Ekblom1993c PMID: 8331561 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Half-Life; Injections, Intravenous; Drug Administration Schedule; Infusions, Intravenous; *Models, Biological; Nociceptors/drug effects; Drug Tolerance; Body Fluid Compartments; Morphine/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plasma morphine concentrations  were not affected by fluoxetine. In comparison to placebo, oral fluoxetine  resulted in less sedation during morphine infusion and less nausea during  morphine washout. Morphine-induced pruritus, psychomotor function, and  respiratory depression were unaffected by fluoxetine. Acute administration of 30  mg oral fluoxetine augmented analgesia by approximately 3% to 8% and reduced  morphine-associated nausea, mood reduction, and drowsiness.","2000-11","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:31:20","","1286-1295","","11","40","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Erjavec2000a PMID: 11075315 place: England","","","","Adult; Humans; Drug Synergism; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Analgesia; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Fluoxetine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Morphine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Nausea/chemically induced/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  present investigation sought to determine if the mu-opiate receptor agonist  methadone incurred a similar immune suppression in B6C3F1 mice. Serum methadone  and corticosterone levels peaked 1 hr following a single subcutaneous injection  of 20 mg/kg methadone HCl. Indeed, the rise in corticosterone levels paralleled  that of methadone. After a single injection with 20 mg/kg methadone a  pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a serum half-life of approximately 2 hr.  Following five injections of methadone over a 24-hr period (every 6 hr),  methadone levels were elevated as would be expected; however, corticosterone  levels did not become elevated. This suggests that the ability of methadone to  elevate corticosterone becomes uncoupled following repeated dosing, indicative of  either a tolerance or an increased catabolic mechanism. Moreover, dosing every 6  hr for 5 days induced an increase in the catabolism of methadone itself.  Therefore, all assays were begun 1 hr after subcutaneous administration of  methadone HCl, a time at which both methadone and corticosterone serum levels  were elevated. The primary IgM antibody response to sheep red blood cells (sRBC)  was suppressed when splenocytes were immunized in vitro. In contrast, animals  immunized with sRBC and assayed for the primary IgM antibody response 4 days  later were not suppressed. The activity of the resident macrophages of the liver  and spleen as measured by the uptake of 51Cr-sRBC was suppressed in a  dose-dependent manner. Previously, it has been demonstrated that morphine  suppresses hepatic and splenic phagocytic activity through an opiate  receptor-mediated pathway that involves the release of corticosterone. It would  appear that methadone plays a similar role in the suppression of hepatic and  splenic phagocytosis.","1995-02","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:56:44","","275-284","","2","24","","Fundam Appl Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= LeVier1995a PMID: 7737438 place: United States","","","","Female; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Half-Life; Body Weight/drug effects; Mice, Inbred DBA; Corticosterone/blood; Spleen/immunology; Erythrocytes/immunology; Immunity/*drug effects; B-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology; Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis/immunology; Listeriosis/immunology; Methadone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity; Mononuclear Phagocyte System/cytology/drug effects; Pneumococcal Infections/immunology; T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical efficacy  of the Biojector System was equivalent to that of needle and syringe injection in  unpublished trials with vaccines, but had not been studied using other drugs.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of the Biojector with conventional needle  and syringe injection in administering intramuscular morphine and subcutaneous  heparin to healthy adults, as measured by plasma drug concentration. METHODS:  Intramuscular injections of morphine 8 mg (5 mg if weight < or = 65 kg) were  given 24 hours apart with the jet injector and with a needle and syringe to 30  subjects at the deltoid site and 10 subjects at the dorsogluteal site. Blood  samples for plasma concentrations of free morphine were drawn at 15, 30, 45, 60,  120, and 240 minutes and were analyzed using radioimmunoassay. Abdominal  subcutaneous injections of heparin 3500 U were given every 8 hours for 5 days  with both injection methods to 29 subjects, with 48 hours between the two series.  Daily blood samples for plasma heparin were analyzed by colorimetric assay for  antifactor Xa activity. RESULTS: Mean free morphine concentration, peak value,  and area under the curve did not differ significantly between the deltoid and  dorsogluteal sites or between the jet injector and needle and syringe. Values of  mean daily heparin concentrations and area under the curve were low and did not  differ between the two injection methods. CONCLUSION: Plasma drug concentrations  provided by the Biojector were equivalent to those provided by conventional  needle and syringe when administering intramuscular morphine and low-dose  subcutaneous heparin.","1996-01","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 05:47:41","","42-48","","1","5","","Am J Crit Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Baer1996a PMID: 8680492 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Analysis of Variance; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Biological Availability; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; *Injections, Jet/instrumentation; Heparin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Injections, Intramuscular/instrumentation; Needlestick Injuries/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aging decreased sulfotransferase activity toward acetaminophen while activity  toward glycolithocholate increased with age. Glucuronosyltransferase activity  toward estrone increased with age, while activity toward testosterone, morphine  and naphthol remained constant. Glutathione-S-transferase  (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) activity was also unchanged through the various age  groups. Cytochrome P-450 content and monooxygenase activity (p-nitroanisole  demethylation) activity decreased with advancing age. Overall, the age-related in  vitro changes in enzyme activities approached or equaled values measured in  5-month-old female Fischer 344 rats. Moreover, age-related alterations in total  phenol sulfotransferase activity and the isozyme pattern paralleled changes in  the in vivo elimination kinetics and metabolic fate of acetaminophen. The  fraction of drug excreted as the sulfate conjugate and the partial clearance to  acetaminophen sulfate decreased with increasing age. Conversely, the fraction  excreted as the glucuronide and the partial clearance to acetaminophen  glucuronide increased with increasing age. There was no effect of aging on the  total clearance of acetaminophen. The gender-related differences in the pattern  of sulfotransferase isozyme activity toward phenolic and bile salt acceptors  disappeared with age. Age-related changes in sulfation and perhaps  glucuronidation in male rats appear to feminize hepatic biotransformation and may  arise due to altered gonadal hormone status.","1986-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 10:51:14","","107-113","","1","237","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Galinsky1986 PMID: 3083094 place: United States","","","","Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism; *Aging; Acetaminophen/*metabolism/urine; Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism; Glutathione Transferase/metabolism; Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism; Sulfurtransferases/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fentanyl is released  from a 72-hour reservoir by diffusion through a controlled-release membrane to  the skin, through which it is absorbed into the microcirculation. The  pharmacokinetics of fentanyl differ markedly as a function of the route of  administration. Unlike intravenous administration, in which peak plasma levels  occur within minutes and the plasma elimination half-life is 2 to 3 hours, after  initial transdermal fentanyl patch application, peak levels occur within 14 hours  and the elimination half-life exceeds 24 hours. When compared with oral morphine  at doses effecting the same degree of pain relief, fewer gastrointestinal  disturbances (nausea, vomiting, and constipation) and better alertness and sleep  quality have been reported in two studies. The transdermal fentanyl patch is as  effective as oral opioids in relieving cancer-related pain, with a safety and  side effect profile equal to or better than that of oral opioids. The convenient,  once-every-72 hours dosing regimen is easily adjusted to the individual's need  for around-the-clock pain control, and provides stable and predictable  therapeutic drug plasma concentrations. Patient acceptability is high and the  cost is lower than other methods required to deliver parenteral opioids. The  recent development of an oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate delivery system for  the treatment of breakthrough pain will further expand the use of transdermal  fentanyl patches for the treatment of chronic pain.","1998-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:07:12","","47-53","","3 Suppl 7","25","","Semin Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Payne1998a PMID: 9671331 place: United States","","","","Humans; Chronic Disease; *Quality of Life; Administration, Cutaneous; Pain/*drug therapy/etiology; Neoplasms/*complications; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Fentanyl/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN:  Randomized, double-blind controlled trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four  patients of ASA physical status 1 or 2, undergoing elective laparoscopic  cholecystectomy, were included. Anaesthesia technique was the same for all  patients. At the end of surgery, they were randomly assigned to one of two  groups. Patients in group bupivacaine were administered 0.375% bupivacaine, 0.6  mL.kg-1 intraperitoneally in both subdiaphragmatic areas and the cholecystectomy  wound, those of the control group were given the same volume of NaCl 0.9%.  Analgesia was provided by morphine PCA. Postoperative pain, assessed on a 100 mm  visual analogue pain scale (VAS), and administered morphine were recorded 30 min  after extubation, and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours later. Blood  samples were collected 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 300 and 480 min after the  intraperitoneal administration of bupivacaine to measure bupivacaine plasma  concentration. Statistics included Student t test and Chi square test. P < 0.05  was considered significant. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between  the two groups with regard to VAS scores during the first 48 postoperative hours.  Morphine requirements (total and at each point) were also similar. Plasma  bupivacaine concentrations reached a plateau at 10-20 min, and then decreased  slowly. The median plasma peak concentration was 0.94 +/- 0.47 microgram.mL-1. In  one patient toxic concentrations (> 1.6 micrograms.mL-1) during the first 60 min  after intraperitoneal administration were obtained, while in another patient a  concentration of 1.58 micrograms.mL-1 was reached twice. CONCLUSIONS:  Intraperitoneal administration of 0.6 mL.kg-1 of 0.375% bupivacaine is  ineffective in reducing postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Furthermore these high doses of bupivacaine may result in toxic plasma  concentrations.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active and  placebo-controlled, five-way crossover study. Pharmacodynamics, safety, and  pharmacokinetics (PKs) were evaluated for up to 36 hours postdose. SETTING:  Single site in Canada (INC Research Toronto). PARTICIPANTS: Healthy male and  female nondependent recreational opioid users underwent a naloxone challenge and  drug discrimination qualification test. INTERVENTION: Single IN dose of ground  ELI-200 (30-mg oxycodone hydrochloride [HCl]/3-mg naltrexone HCl), crushed 30-mg  oxycodone HCl IR (Roxicodone®), placebo, fixed placebo, and single oral dose of  intact ELI-200 (30mg/3mg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Peak effect (E(max)) for bipolar  Drug Liking (0-100 point visual analog scale). RESULTS: Of the 44 randomized  subjects, 37 completed all five treatment periods. All active treatments showed  significantly higher (p<0.001) median Drug Liking E(max) relative to placebo.  Significant reductions (p<0.001) in median Drug Liking [E(max)] were observed for  IN ELI-200 [56.0] compared to IN oxycodone IR [100.0]. Secondary positive or  objective measures (High, Good Drug Effects, Overall Drug Liking, Take Drug  Again, and maximum pupil constriction) showed significantly lower E(max) for IN  ELI-200 (p<0.001) compared to IN oxycodone IR. CONCLUSIONS: IN administration of  ELI-200 demonstrated significantly decreased effects on subjective and  physiologic measures, and greater nasal irritation, compared to IN oxycodone IR.  These findings, along with the PK profile of naltrexone, demonstrated that when  ELI-200 capsules were ground and administered intranasally, the naltrexone  component was rapidly released and conferred meaningful abuse-deterrent  properties.","2017-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:13:36","","449-464","","6","13","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Setnik2017b PMID: 29308591 place: United States","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Cross-Over Studies; Young Adult; Drug Combinations; Administration, Intranasal; Drug Compounding; *Abuse-Deterrent Formulations/adverse effects; *Illicit Drugs/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Drug Users/psychology; Naltrexone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Narcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Opioid-Related Disorders/*prevention & control/psychology; Oxycodone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Randomized, open, single-dose, prospective study. SETTING: Postanesthesia  care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: 54 ASA physical status I-III  patients scheduled for lower major abdominal, gynecologic, or urologic surgery.  INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 comparable groups, to receive,  for 72 hours postoperatively, an IV (Group IV) or epidural (Group EP)  constant-rate infusion of fentanyl (loading dose 1.5 micrograms/kg, infusion rate  1 micrograms/kg/hr), or a transdermal patch (Group TTS), applied preoperatively,  delivering fentanyl 75 micrograms/hr. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pain  intensity, vital signs, blood gas status, and plasma fentanyl concentration (Cp)  were measured for up to 96 hours postoperatively. Onset of analgesia was delayed  in Group TTS. Analgesic efficacy was similar for all 3 routes of administration  except during the first 4 hours in Group TTS. Initially, the patients in Groups  TTS and IV needed significantly more rescue morphine than those in Group EP. The  time course for fentanyl Cp in Groups TTS and IV evolved to similar plateau  levels. However, fentanyl Cp continued to rise throughout the study period in  Group EP, reaching concentrations that elicited hypoxemia after 48 hours. A  significant negative relationship existed between fentanyl Cp and oxygen  saturation in this group. All 3 routes of administration showed similar  frequencies of side effects (i.e., nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and ileus).  CONCLUSIONS: The epidural, transdermal, and IV administration of identical doses  of fentanyl given at a constant rate provided almost equivalent degrees of  analgesia. But continuing epidural administration produced a steady rise in  systemic fentanyl concentrations into the ventilatory-depressant range, affecting  the hypoxemic regulation of breathing.","1994-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:19:33","","308-314","","4","6","","J Clin Anesth","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= vanLersberghe1994a PMID: 7946367 place: United States","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Half-Life; Infusions, Intravenous; Pain Measurement; Analgesia/*methods; Oxygen/blood; Administration, Cutaneous; Pain, Postoperative/*prevention & control; Morphine/administration & dosage; Respiration/drug effects; *Analgesia, Epidural; Carbon Dioxide/blood; Fentanyl/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their relevance in a study of the influence of clomipramine on  morphine analgesia in mice.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","","0022-3565","","","Many studies have shown tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) to potentiate morphine analgesia, but more recent work, using different modes of administration, has  revealed inhibition of morphine analgesia by TCAs. The influence of different  modes of administration of clomipramine (CMI) on morphine analgesia assessed by  the hot-plate test was studied in mice. The administration procedure was based on  the pharmacokinetic parameters of CMI determined in the strain used. Acute and  chronic (i.e., every half-life of 130 min for five half-lives) administration of  CMI (10 or 20 mg/kg i.p.) had opposite effects; the former potentiated morphine  analgesia and the latter inhibited it. Five closely repeated administrations  (i.e., every 40 min) suppressed the potentiation without producing inhibition.  The time course of the influence of CMI showed that the inhibition of morphine  analgesia observed after repeated administration of a given dose of CMI occurred  if the latter was present for sufficient time; this time decreased when the dose  of CMI was increased. Moreover, comparison with literature data shows the  importance of standardized patterns of repeated administration: the variability  in the frequency of repeated administration and in the time-lag between the last  injection of TCA and the test may account for the varying results observed. The  discrepancies in the literature regarding TCA/morphine interaction are thus only  apparent, and arise merely from varying conditions. Possible mechanisms for the  CMI-morphine interaction are discussed: involvement of opiate receptors and/or  the serotonergic system.","1989-02","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:32:29","","747-751","","2","248","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Fialip1989a PMID: 2918477 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; *Analgesia; Clomipramine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: CNTF was administered  using a drug pump implanted into the lumbar subarachnoid space in each of four  patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Escalating doses (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 4,  and 8 micrograms/h) were infused for 48 hours per week in 2-week cycles until the  highest tolerated dose was achieved. Patients were observed for side effects, and  standardized muscle and respiratory function tests were performed. Cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) levels of CNTF were determined using simultaneous lumbar and cervical  taps. Plasma and CSF levels of antibodies, CSF cells and protein, and routine  blood chemistries were monitored, as were weight and vital signs. RESULTS:  Pharmacokinetic studies of four patients demonstrated that the distribution and  clearance of recombinant human (rH)CNTF are similar to those of many small,  water-soluble agents (morphine, baclofen, clonidine) and that the steady-state  concentration of rHCNTF at the cervical level was 18 to 36% of that at the lumbar  level. Lumbar CSF levels were in the range of 44 to 1230 ng/ml. Intrathecally  administered rHCNTF had different adverse effects than the systemically delivered  drug. With intrathecal administration, no asthenia, fever, chills, nausea, weight  loss, increased cough, or sputum production was found. All patients who received  rHCNTF intrathecally experienced dose-related CSF pleocytosis (primarily  lymphocytic) and rises in protein levels. No clinical signs of meningeal  irritation, such as stiff neck, photophobias, or nausea, were seen. However, one  patient who had lumbar spinal stenosis developed severe burning and cramping leg  pain. A second patient developed a severe headache and leg and back cramping. No  abnormal clinical chemistry or hematological findings were encountered. Plasma  levels of rHCNTF were below detection. Antibodies to rHCNTF were found in the  systemic circulation of only one patient. The gradual decline in motor strength  and performance of standard skills did not improve or worsen. CONCLUSIONS: In  this first trial of a recombinant neurotrophic factor to be administered  intrathecally by drug pump, the CNTF was well distributed along the spinal canal.  Pain syndromes (headache, radicular pain) that were dose-related occurred in two  patients, but systemic side effects, which had been observed with subcutaneous  rHCNTF, did not occur. Intrathecal drug pump delivery of neurotrophic factors may  be the most appropriate way in which to test the efficacy of these high-molecular  weight proteins, because high CSF levels can be achieved without significant  systemic side effects.","1997-01","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:07:25","","94-99; discussion 99-100","","1","40","","Neurosurgery","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Penn1997a PMID: 8971830 place: United States","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology; Injections, Spinal; Infusion Pumps, Implantable; Activities of Daily Living/classification; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/diagnosis/*therapy; Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor; Nerve Growth Factors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Nerve Tissue Proteins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two doses of morphine sulfate (5 and 10 mg/70 kg, i.v.) and a  placebo dose (0 mg/70 kg, i.v.) were administered to healthy volunteers under  three infusion rates (2 min bolus, 15 min, and 60 min). Faster infusions of  morphine produced greater positive subjective effects than slower infusions on  visual analog scale measures of good drug effect, drug liking, and high. Faster  infusions also resulted in greater self-reported drug effects and opioid agonist  effects, without producing significant physiological or psychomotor impairment.  Importantly, faster rates of drug infusion produced significantly higher morphine  plasma levels than slower rates, and morphine plasma levels followed a similar  pattern and timing of peak effect as the self-reported effects of the drug.  Moreover, morphine produced dose-dependent increases in self-reported drug  effects, opioid agonist effects, and morphine plasma levels in the study. Results  suggest that the pharmacokinetic properties of a drug, including the dosage  administered and the rate of at which it is administered may function to jointly  affect the abuse liability of the drug.","2001-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:00:33","","1056-1065","","3","299","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Marsch2001a PMID: 11714895 place: United States","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Infusions, Intravenous; Respiration/drug effects; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology; Skin Temperature/drug effects; Narcotics/*administration & dosage/pharmacology; Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects/physiology; Vision, Ocular/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MOR is extensively metabolized to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and  morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). A rapid and sensitive method that was able to  reliably detect at least 0.5 ng/ml of MOR and 1.0 ng/ml of M6G was required to  define their pharmacokinetic profiles. An LC-MS-MS method was developed in our  laboratory to quantify all three analytes with the required sensitivity and a  rapid turnaround time. A solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used to isolate MOR,  M3G, M6G, and their corresponding deuterated internal standards from heparinized  plasma. The extract was injected on a LC tandem mass spectrometer with a turbo  ion-spray interface. Baseline chromatographic separation among MOR, M3G, and M6G  peaks was achieved on a silica column with an aqueous organic mobile phase  consisting of formic acid, water, and acetonitrile. The total chromatographic run  time was 3 min per injection, with retention times of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.4 min for  MOR, M6G, and M3G, respectively. Chromatographic separation of M3G and M6G from  MOR was paramount in establishing the LC-MS-MS method selectivity because of  fragmentation of M3G and M6G to MOR at the LC-MS interface. The standard curve  range in plasma was 0.5-50 ng/ml for MOR, 1.0-100 ng/ml for M6G, and 10-1000  ng/ml for M3G. The inter-day precision and accuracy of the quality control (QC)  samples were <7% relative standard deviation (RSD) and <6% relative error (R.E.)  for MOR, <9% RSD and <5% R.E. for M6G, and <3% RSD and <6% R.E. for M3G.

DESIGN:  Randomized prospective clinical trial. Patients were not told which agent they  received (single-blind). SETTING: Department of anesthesia and gynecology  surgical service at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Forty women undergoing  abdominal hysterectomy (n = 39) or myomectomy (n = 1). INTERVENTIONS: Patients  received either methadone (Group 1) or morphine (Group 2) 20 mg intravenously  (IV) following induction of anesthesia, additional IV opioid in the recovery  room, and subsequent opioid as needed (PRN) intramuscularly (IM) on the  postsurgical wards. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pain was assessed using a  visual analog scale (VAS). Respiratory rate, sedation, and hemodynamics were  assessed frequently (at least every 4 hours). Patients were studied for 72 hours  following recovery room discharge. Patients required less methadone than morphine  in the recovery room (2.0 +/- 2.9 mg vs 4.4 +/- 2.9 mg). Patients requested less  methadone than morphine for pain relief on the wards (4.5 +/- 4.2 mg vs 42.3 +/-  14.3 mg). Patients in the methadone group reported lower pain intensity by VAS  (1.9 +/- 0.3 vs 3.4 +/- 0.6). These differences are statistically significant (p  less than 0.01). CONCLUSION: Sustained analgesia with methadone is predicted by  its pharmacokinetics. Patients who received 22 +/- 2.9 mg of IV methadone  (combined intraoperative and recovery room doses) reported less pain and required  minimal additional analgesic over the next 72 hours than did patients who  received morphine. This is consistent with sustained therapeutic plasma levels  due to methadone's long plasma half-life (54 +/- 20 hours). Use of methadone in  this manner is an effective therapy for postoperative pain control and is not  associated with toxicity or notable side effects.","1991-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:10:17","","112-116","","2","3","","J Clin Anesth","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Richlin1991a PMID: 2039637 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Methadone/*therapeutic use; Morphine/therapeutic use; *Hysterectomy; Leiomyoma/epidemiology/surgery; Pain, Postoperative/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Uterine Neoplasms/epidemiology/surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The VAS score was slightly reduced after the bolus  (6.6 +/- 1.0 vs 8.7 +/- 0.3; P < 0.05 vs the placebo group) but the cumulative  doses of morphine were similar in both groups. There was a slight, but not  sustained, improvement in pulmonary function test.

The codeine resinate and  chlorpheniramine resinate beads were prepared by a batch process and then  impregnated with Polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000), respectively. The PEG  impregnated drug resinate beads were coated with ethylcellulose as the coating  polymer and di-n-butyl-phthalate as plasticizer in ethanol and methylene chloride  mixture by the Wurster process. The coated PEG impregnated drug resinate beads  were dispersed in an aqueous suspending vehicle containing 0.5% w/w xanthan gum  and 0.5% w/w of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose of nominal viscosity of 4000 cps,  obtaining codeine resinate and chlorpheniramine resinate sustained-release  suspension (CCSS). Codeine phosphate and chlorpheniramine maleate were  respectively loaded onto AMBERLITE IRP 69, and PEG 4000 was used to impregnate  drug resinate beads to maintain their geometry. Ethylcellulose with  di-n-butyl-phthalate in ethanol and methylene chloride mixture for the coating of  drug resinate beads was performed in Glatt fluidized bed coater, where the  coating solution flow rate was 8-12 g/min, the inlet air temperature was 50-60  degrees C, the outlet air temperature was 32-38 degrees C, the atomizing air  pressure was 2.0 bar and the fluidized air pressure was adjusted as required. Few  significant agglomeration of circulating drug resinate beads was observed during  the operation. The film weight gained 20% w/w and 15% w/w were suitable for the  PEG impregnated codeine resinate and chlorpheniramine resinate beads,  respectively. Residual solvent content increased with coating level, but  inprocess drying could reduce residual solvent content. In the present study, the  rates of drug release from both drug resinate beads were measured in 0.05 M and  0.5M KCl solutions. The increased ionic strength generally accelerated the  release rate of both drugs. But the release of codeine from its resinate beads  was much more rapid than chlorpheniramine released from its resinate beads in the  same ionic strength release medium. The drug release specification of the CCSS,  where release mediums were 0.05 M KCl solution for codeine and 0.5 M KCl solution  for chlorpheniramine, was established to be in conformance with in vivo  performance. Relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetics evaluation of the  CCSS, using commercial immediate-release tablets as the reference preparation,  were performed following a randomized two-way crossover design in beagle dogs.  The drug concentrations in plasma were measured by a validated LC-MS/MS method to  determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of CCSS. This LC-MS/MS method  demonstrated high accuracy and precision for bioanalysis, and was proved quick  and reliable for the pharmacokinetic studies. The results showed that the CCSS  had the longer value of Tmax and the lower value of Cmax, which meant an  obviously sustained release effect, and its relative bioavailability of codeine  and chlorpheniramine were (103.6 +/- 14.6)% and (98.1 +/- 10.3)%, respectively,  compared with the reference preparation. These findings indicated that a novel  liquid sustained release suspension made by using IERs as carriers and subsequent  fluidized bed coating might provide a constant plasma level of the active  pharmaceutical ingredient being highly beneficial for various therapeutic  reasons.","2007-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-12-11 05:40:58","","649-665","","6","33","","Drug Dev Ind Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Zeng2007a PMID: 17613029 place: England","","","","Animals; Biological Availability; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Dogs; Random Allocation; Delayed-Action Preparations; Osmolar Concentration; Drug Carriers; Drug Compounding; Polyethylene Glycols; Suspensions; *Ion Exchange Resins; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Chlorpheniramine/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Codeine/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Histamine H1 Antagonists/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Resins, Synthetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L.","Pharmacokinetic drug interactions with oral contraceptives.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199018060-00004","","Oral contraceptive steroids are used by an estimated 60 to 70 million women world-wide. Over the past 20 years there have been both case reports and clinical  studies on the topic of drug interactions with these agents. Some of the  interactions are of definite therapeutic relevance, whereas others can be  discounted as being of no clinical significance. Pharmacological interactions  between oral contraceptive steroids and other compounds may be of 2 kinds: (a)  drugs may impair the efficacy of oral contraceptive steroids, leading to  breakthrough bleeding and pregnancy (in a few cases, the activity of the  contraceptive is enhanced); (b) oral contraceptive steroids may interfere with  the metabolism of other drugs. A number of anticonvulsants (phenobarbital,  phenytoin, carbamazepine) are enzyme-inducing agents and thereby increase the  clearance of the oral contraceptive steroids. Valproic acid has no  enzyme-inducing properties, and thus women on this anticonvulsant can rely on  their low dose oral contraceptive steroids for contraceptive protection.  Researchers are now beginning to unravel the molecular basis of this interaction,  with evidence of specific forms of cytochrome P450 (P450IIC and IIIA gene  families) being induced by phenobarbital. Rifampicin, the antituberculous drug,  also induces a cytochrome P450 which is a product of the P450IIIA gene subfamily.  This isozyme is one of the major forms involved in 2-hydroxylation of  ethinylestradiol. Broad spectrum antibiotics have been implicated in causing pill  failure; case reports document the interaction, and general practitioners are  convinced that it is real. The problem remains that there is still no firm  clinical pharmacokinetic evidence which indicates that blood concentrations of  oral contraceptive steroids are altered by antibiotics. However, perhaps this  should not be a surprise, given that the incidence of the interaction may be very  low. It is suggested that an individual at risk will have a low bioavailability  of ethinylestradiol, a large enterohepatic recirculation and gut flora  particularly susceptible to the antibiotic being used. Two drugs, ascorbic acid  (vitamin C) and paracetamol (acetaminophen), give rise to increased blood  concentrations of ethinylestradiol due to competition for sulphation. The  interactions could have some significance to women on oral contraceptive steroids  who regularly take high doses of either drug. Although on theoretical grounds  adsorbents (e.g. magnesium trisilicate, aLuminium hydroxide, activated charcoal  and kaolin) could be expected to interfere with oral contraceptive efficacy,  there is no firm evidence that this is the case. Similarly, there is no evidence  that smoking alters the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptive steroids. These  agents are now well documented as being able to alter the pharmacokinetics of  other concomitantly administered drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 05:47:22","","472-484","","6","18","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Back1990a PMID: 2191822 place: Switzerland","","","","Humans; Animals; Biology; Drug Interactions; Europe; Physiology; *Drug Interactions; England; *Alcohol Drinking; United Kingdom; Developed Countries; Contraception; Contraceptive Methods; Family Planning; Treatment; Behavior; Vitamins; Prostaglandins; *Drugs; Northern Europe; Endocrine System; *Plasma Protein Binding Capacity; Hemic System; *Literature Review; *Oral Contraceptives; Enzymes And Enzyme Inhibitors; Contraceptives, Oral/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; *Enzymes; *Antibiotics; *Ascorbic Acid; *Prostaglandin Antagonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CYP2D6 oxidation polymorphism divides the Caucasian  population in two phenotypes: approximately 8% with no enzyme activity, poor  metabolizers (PM) and the remainder with preserved CYP2D6 activity, extensive  metabolizers (EM). The objective of the study was to determine if the analgesic  effect of oxycodone in human experimental pain depends on its metabolism to  oxymorphone. The analgesic effect of oxycodone was evaluated in a randomized,  placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover experiment including 33 (16 EM and  17 PM) healthy volunteers. Pain tests were performed before and 1, 2, 3 and 4 hr  after medication and included pain detection and tolerance thresholds to single  electrical sural nerve stimulation, pain summation threshold to repetitive  electrical sural nerve stimulation and the cold pressor test with rating of  discomfort and pain-time area under curve (AUC(0-2 min.)). For single sural nerve  stimulation, there was a less pronounced increase in thresholds on oxycodone in  pain detection (9% vs. 20%, P = 0.02, a difference of 11%, CI: 2%-20%) and pain  tolerance thresholds (15% vs. 26%, P = 0.037, a difference of 10%, CI: 1%-20%)  for PM compared with EM. In the cold pressor test, there was less reduction in  pain AUC on oxycodone for PM compared with EM (14% vs. 26%, P = 0.012, a  difference of 12%, CI: 3%-22%). The plasma oxymorphone/oxycodone ratio was  significantly lower in PM compared with EM (P < 0.001).

All are agonists and, in an effort to  correlate their prolonged inhibition of binding with their pharmacology, we  examined their analgesic actions in vivo. Dose-response curves at 1 hr revealed  similar potencies of oxymorphone and the derivatives, with the exception of  OxyPNPH which was significantly less potent. After 10 hr, oxymorphone at doses up  to 50 mg/kg did not demonstrate any effect. In contrast, OxyPNPH at 25 mg/kg  elevated tail-flick latencies from 2 to over 8 sec after 10 hr. The 50-mg/kg dose  elevated latencies to approximately 5 sec after 24 hr. Oxymorphonazine and  oxymorphone phenylhydrazone also produced a prolonged analgesia, although not as  effectively as OxyPNPH. The prolonged analgesic actions of OxyPNPH were highly  dependent upon a critical period of 2 to 3 h immediately after injection.  Blockade of receptors during this period with naloxone prevented analgesia at all  time points examined. If the long duration of action of OxyPNPH resulted simply  from a long half-life and persistent-free compound within the brain, analgesia  should have returned by 8 hr, at which time naloxone has been eliminated. The  absence of analgesia 8 hr after both OxyPNPH and naloxone argues against simple  pharmacokinetic mechanisms for the prolonged analgesia and is consistent with  persistent receptor occupation. OxyPNPH (25 mg/kg) administered in vivo lowered  radiolabeled opioid binding effectively in brain membranes despite extensive  washing. OxyPNPH lowered mu1 binding by approximately 60% and mu2 binding by 35%  whereas delta binding was not lowered significantly.","1988-04","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:21:22","","8-12","","1","245","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Williams1988a PMID: 2452249 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Time Factors; Mice; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Naloxone/pharmacology; *Analgesia; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Enkephalins/metabolism; Receptors, Opioid/metabolism; Enkephalin, Leucine-2-Alanine; Enkephalin, Leucine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Hydrazones/pharmacology; Hydromorphone/*analogs & derivatives; Oxymorphone/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia  (IVPCA) has been widely used to provide analgesia by divided bolus doses on  patients' demand with satisfactory effects. This approach, by reducing the peak  serum surge, largely resembles the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantage  of continuous infusion. There is yet no report on the investigation of its effect  on post-operative bowel dysfunction. METHODS: Fifty-one women who underwent  abdominal total hysterectomy (ATH) due to uterine myoma were enrolled to  investigate the association between the doses of morphine consumption by PCA and  the time of first passage of flatus. In all patients morphine was administered  intravenously via a PCA pump immediately after recovery from general anesthesia.  RESULTS: We found that 49 out of 51 patients (96%) exhibited mild pain with IVPCA  morphine. They had consumed an average dose of 16.9 mg morphine (range, 0-46 mg)  upon the first passage of flatus which occurred 2036.4 min (average)  post-operatively. There was no correlation between the dose of morphine and the  time of first passage of flatus (r = 0.053, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The absence  of suppression of bowel movement by IVPCA morphine for post-operative pain  control suggests that favorable pharmacokinetic profile of IVPCA can help reduce  the morphine-induced bowel dysfunction at its therapeutic level.","2002-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:13:03","","61-64","","2","40","","Acta Anaesthesiol Sin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Chan2002a PMID: 12194392 place: China (Republic : 1949- )","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Pain Measurement; *Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Gastrointestinal Motility/*drug effects; Flatulence; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy/etiology; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Hysterectomy/*adverse effects; Intestines/*physiology; Leiomyoma/surgery; Morphine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Uterine Neoplasms/surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  investigation was carried out to evaluate the bioavailability of a recent  sustained-release (SR) formulation of morphine sulphate (30 mg), Skenan,  consisted of capsules, relative to a recognized product, Moscontin which is a  matrix tablet SR form. The bioavailability was carried out on 12 healthy male  volunteers who received a single dose (30 mg) of the test (T) and the recognized  (R) products in a randomized balanced 2-way crossover design. After dosing,  serial blood samples were collected for a period of 24 hours. Morphine and its  main metabolites (i.e. glucuronides M6G and M3G) were assayed by high-performance  liquid chromatography using a ion-pair formation. Data were analyzed by a  noncompartmental method and were compared by ANOVA method and, each subject taken  as his own control, by the Wilcoxon T test. Mean bioavailability of the T  formulation was greater than that of R. The parametric confidence intervals (90%)  of the mean values of the pharmacokinetics characteristics for T:R ratio were in  each case without the bioequivalence acceptable ranges of 0.8-1.25 and 0.70-1.43  respectively for AUCs (i.e. AUCo-->24h and AUCo-->infinity) and Cmax, while  confidence intervals symmetric of Westlake (CIW90%) was invariably greater than  20%, i.e. 62.8, 71.1 and 39.3% respectively. Further, the test formulation was  not found bioequivalent to the reference formulation by Schuirmann's 2 one-sided  t-test. These results justify the conclusion of the non-bioequivalence of the two  forms at the unit dose of 30 mg. This information must be considered above all as  a dosage adjustment tool enabling use of the two forms by application of a  correction factor of the order of 15% when prescribing Skenan in comparison with  Moscontin. Assessment is needed of the possible clinical consequences of this  finding.","1995-11","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-12-04 05:49:11","","588-594","","11","33","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Bourget1995a PMID: 8688982 place: Germany","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8688982","Adult; Humans; Male; Cross-Over Studies; Therapeutic Equivalency; data:timecourse; Delayed-Action Preparations; species:human; priority:high; data:pharmacokinetics; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacokinetics; checked:DM","Analgesics, Opioid; Morphine; Morphine Derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its high first-pass hepatic metabolism prevents  effectiveness by the oral route; instead, subcutaneous injection is the usual  route, and intranasal, sublingual, rectal, and iontophoretic transdermal delivery  has been investigated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The rate of  uptake after subcutaneous injection is influenced by factors such as location,  temperature, depth of injection, and body fat. Studies have shown the latency of  onset to clinical effect after s.c. injection ranged from 7.3 to 14 minutes.  Cerebrospinal fluid T(max)lags behind plasma T(max) by 10 to 20 minutes.  Considerable intersubject variability is found with pharmacokinetic variables; in  some studies there are five- to tenfold differences in C(max)and  area-under-the-concentration-time-curve seen in PD patients. Apomorphine  metabolism occurs through several enzymatic pathways, including N-demethylation,  sulfation, glucuronidation, and catechol-O-methyltransferase as well as by  nonenzymatic oxidation. The complexities of apomorphine uptake, distribution, and  clearance probably contribute to its variability of clinical actions.","2004-03-23","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:56:57","","S8-11","","6 Suppl 4","62","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= LeWitt2004a PMID: 15037665 place: United States","","","","Humans; Injections, Subcutaneous; Parkinson Disease/*drug therapy; Antiparkinson Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Apomorphine/*administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Dopamine Agonists/*administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the preoperative holding area, one group  (Group O) received Fentanyl Oralet (fentanyl 10-15 micrograms/kg), and the other  (Group IV) received only the candy matrix. Patients in Group O received an i.v.  injection of saline, and those in Group IV received an i.v. injection of fentanyl  (2 micrograms/kg) after removal of the first tonsil. Except for the opioid,  patients received a standard anesthetic. Preoperative sedation and cooperation  were assessed. Postoperative pain was evaluated using an objective pain scale.  Patients in Group O were more sedated but no more cooperative at the induction of  anesthesia compared with those in Group IV. No patient vomited preoperatively or  experienced preoperative or postoperative desaturation. Time to postanesthesia  care unit (PACU) discharge was not different between groups. There was no  significant difference in the number of patients requiring morphine in the PACU  (6 of 21 in Group O versus 10 of 19 in Group IV). Plasma fentanyl concentrations  were not a reliable indicator of the need for postoperative morphine. Among the  patients who required morphine postoperatively, there was an 11-fold variation in  plasma fentanyl concentrations at the time of morphine administration. Derived  pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those previously reported in children;  bioavailability of the fentanyl in Fentanyl Oralet was 0.33. We conclude that  premedication with Fentanyl Oralet did not differ with i.v. fentanyl in regard to  the induction of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. IMPLICATIONS: In this  double-blind, randomized study, we studied the efficacy of Fentanyl Oralet (10-15  micrograms/kg) preoperatively for providing postoperative analgesia in children  undergoing tonsillectomy. We found no incidence of preoperative desaturation or  vomiting in any patient. This is in contrast to other studies, in which there was  a longer time interval between Fentanyl Oralet completion and induction of  anesthesia. The bio-availability of the fentanyl in Fentanyl Oralet was estimated  to be 33%, which is less than that reported in adults (approximately 50%). There  was no difference in postoperative opioid requirements between patients who  received 2 micrograms/kg of fentanyl i.v. and those who received Fentanyl Oralet.","1998-01","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:29:00","","66-70","","1","86","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Dsida1998a PMID: 9428853 place: United States","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Prospective Studies; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Child; Child, Preschool; *Preanesthetic Medication; Pain, Postoperative/*prevention & control; *Tonsillectomy; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage; Fentanyl/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This experiment was conducted to  characterize M3G disposition after direct administration of the metabolite to  intact or bile duct-cannulated (BC) rats, and to develop a pharmacokinetic model  of EHR for M3G. Male Sprague-Dawley intact and BC rats (N = 4/group) received a 5  mg/kg iv bolus of M3G, with serum and bile sampled at timed intervals after the  dose; urine was collected in toto at the end of the experiment. M3G elimination  from serum was rapid in BC rats; in contrast, M3G residence was prolonged in  intact animals. M3G biliary excretion rate vs. time profiles paralleled the M3G  serum concentration-time profiles in BC rats, with up to 20% of the dose  recovered as M3G in bile. The remainder of the dose (80%) was recovered in urine  as unchanged M3G. No morphine could be detected in urine after M3G  administration. To confirm that biliary elimination of M3G occurred following  uptake by the liver, M3G was administered to isolated perfused rat livers (N =  4). Up to 20% of the M3G dose was recovered in bile after 90 min, suggesting that  systemic M3G can gain access to the liver and contribute to EHR.

The maximum levels in plasma were already reached after one to  two hours. In both active substances the suppositories displayed a classical  retardation effect. In contrast to acetaminophen the rectal absorption of codeine  was almost as effective as the oral absorption. Thus this application form shows  almost bioequivalency vis-à-vis the capsule form.

Microdialysis probes  were placed in the striatum and into the jugular vein of Sprague-Dawley rats.  Each probe was calibrated in vivo using retrodialysis by drug. M6G was  administered as a 4-h exponential i.v. infusion, and the experiment was repeated  the following day with the addition of probenecid. The data were analysed using  NONMEM. An integrated model including the total arterial concentrations, the  dialysate concentrations in brain and blood, and the recovery measurements, was  developed. The extent of BBB transport, expressed as the ratio between clearance  into the brain and clearance out of the brain (CL(in)/CL(out)), was estimated as  0.29 on both days, indicating that efflux transporters act on M6G at the BBB.  However, the probenecid-sensitive transporters are not involved in the brain  efflux, as the ratio was unaltered although probenecid was co-administered. In  contrast, the systemic elimination of M6G decreased by 22% (p<0.05) upon  probenecid co-administration. The half-life of M6G was longer in the brain than  in blood on both experimental days (p<0.05). In conclusion, probenecid decreased  the systemic elimination of M6G, but had no effect on the BBB transport of M6G.","2005-01","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-12-11 05:58:01","","49-57","","1","24","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Tunblad2005a PMID: 15626577 place: Netherlands","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Brain/*drug effects/metabolism; Drug Delivery Systems/*methods; Morphine Derivatives/*administration & dosage; Probenecid/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concentrations in plasma of  morphine and its metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide, were 4.2 +/- 1.4 microM and  7.7 +/- 4.0 microM, respectively, during the constant rate infusion. The  corresponding estimated unbound concentrations of morphine in striatum varied  between 0.06 and 0.11 microM. No morphine-3-glucuronide was detected in the brain  dialysates. The unbound concentration in striatum was lower than expected based  on unbound plasma concentrations and could be an indication of active transport  from the brain. Five different equations were tested to find the best empirical  description of the relationship between microdialysate concentration and  perfusion rate by nonlinear regression analysis. The equations were validated by  a serum in vitro study, where three unbound concentrations of morphine estimated  from microdialyis were compared to estimates obtained from equilibrium dialysis.  The precision of the parameter estimates obtained from the five equations was  tested by Monte Carlo simulations. One of the equations (Eq. 4) was selected in  preference to the others, because of the good agreement with the estimated  unbound concentration obtained by equilibrium dialysis in vitro, and good  precision of the parameter estimates. The method described in this paper is  valuable when estimating the unbound concentration of drug from microdialysate  concentrations during steady state conditions. Furthermore, the method is easily  accessible when working in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic field.","1992","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:32:15","","449-460","","6","51","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Ekblom1992a PMID: 1635423 place: Netherlands","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Biological Transport, Active; Infusions, Intravenous; Monte Carlo Method; Corpus Striatum/*metabolism; Morphine/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine Derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; *Dialysis/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 1-substituted tetrazolinones 2 were essentially prepared via the addition  reaction of aluminium azide to isocyanates or acid chlorides in tetrahydrofuran.  Alkylation of 2 under neutral or weakly basic conditions afforded almost  exclusively the 1,4-disubstituted tetrazolinone isomer 3. N-Alkylation of the  piperidine derivatives 4 with 3 in dimethylformamide yielded 9a-v. The  morphinomimetic activity in rats, after intravenous injection of the compounds,  was evaluated in the tail withdrawal reflex test. The fentanyl analogues 9a-c (R4  = H) are inactive at the measured dose of 2.5 or 10 mg/kg (iv). For the  carfentanil analogues (R4 = COOCH3) maximal narcotic activity is found when R1  represents a lower alkyl group (9d-f) or a thienylethyl group (9n). The  sufentanil analogues (R4 = CH2OCH3) show the same structure-activity relationship  (SAR) profile as the carfentanil derivatives (R4 = COOCH3). The structural  requirements for optimal activity are in good agreement with earlier observations  in the series of 10-12. From the series the ethyl tetrazolinone derivative 9r,  alfentanil (R 39209), was selected for clinical investigation. As an analgesic in  rats, 9r is 140 times more potent than pethidine 15 and 72 times more potent than  morphine 14. Alftentanil reaches its peak effect within 1 min after injection,  and its duration of action is very short; at 2 times its MED50, 9r has a duration  of action of 11 min. This duration is 30 min for 10 and 90 min for 14. Compared  to 10, alfentanil 9r is about 4 times faster but 3 times shorter acting.  Structurally, 9r shows most resemblance to sufentanil 12, since it differs only  by substitution of a 4-ethyltetrazolinone ring for the thiophene ring. The  considerable differences in their pharmacological profiles were explained in  terms of marked variations in physicochemical and, hence, pharmacokinetic  properties.","1986-11","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:47:07","","2290-2297","","11","29","","J Med Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Janssens1986a PMID: 2878076 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Structure-Activity Relationship; Alfentanil; Analgesics, Opioid/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology; Fentanyl/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS: Three hundred  ninety-five adults (opioid experienced and opioid naïve) with moderate-to-severe  chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). INTERVENTIONS: Open-label, oral ALO-02 capsules,  daily dose ranging from 20 to 160 mg oxycodone for up to 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: Number and type of adverse events (AEs) and drugrelated AEs, including  assessments of withdrawal (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale; COWS),  pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and aberrant behaviors (Current Opioid Misuse  Measure). RESULTS: A total of 193 (48.9 percent) patients received ALO-02 for  ≥181 days and 105 (26.6 percent) patients for ≥361 days. The most common  treatment-emergent AEs were nausea (25.3 percent), constipation (21.3 percent),  vomiting (13.9 percent), and headache (11.6 percent).

Our objective was to describe  application of this technology to immediate-release (IR) ADFs. DESIGN: For  development of a sample IR ADF (hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) based on  HME, feasibility studies were performed using different excipients. The  formulation selected for further development was evaluated via in vitro test  battery. Moreover, in vivo performance of IR ADF technologies was investigated in  an open-label, randomized, cross-over, phase 1, relative oral bioavailability  study with another opioid (model compound). SETTING: Single-center  bioavailability trial. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four healthy white male subjects.  INTERVENTIONS: ADF IR formulation of an opioid and marketed IR formulation. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURE(S): For feasibility and in vitro studies, dissolution profiles,  syringeability, particle size distribution after physical manipulation, and  extractability were evaluated. For the phase 1 study, pharmacokinetic parameters  were evaluated and compared for ADF IR and a marketed IR formulation. RESULTS:  After manipulation, the majority of particles from the ADF IR formulation were  >500µm and, thus, not considered suitable for intranasal abuse, while the  majority of particles for the reference marketed IR formulation were <500µm. The  ADF IR formulation was resistant to syringing and preparation for potential  intravenous injection. In healthy subjects, pharmacokinetics of an ADF and  marketed IR formulation of an opioid were nearly identical.

The opiate concentration in saliva  peaked within 30 min of drug administration and returned to near the predose  level within 24 h. Ninety-one percent of the total secretion of opiates in sweat  was collected by the skin-collection patch worn during the first 24 h after drug  administration.

Opiates were detected in extracts of alkali digests of beard  hair in all subjects on the day after drug administration. Hair concentration  peaked on day 3 after dosing and then decreased continuously until day 8. From  day 8 until the end of the experiment on day 14, beard hair contained opiate  concentrations significantly greater than the predose level. From comparison with  cotinine pharmacokinetics, it is proposed that an early and the largest transfer  of opiates into beard hair is through sweat. Transfer during hair growth is  secondary and of comparable importance to a newly identified contribution of long  duration that may involve transfer from storage depots within skin.","1996-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:11:41","","724-728","","6","18","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Callaghan1996a PMID: 8946673 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Saliva/chemistry; Codeine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Hair/*chemistry; Narcotics/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Sweat/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  BG-IMER was coupled to a reversed-phase column (C8 or C18) and the latter column  was used to separate substrates and products eluted from the beta-glucuronidase  reactor. The activity of the BG-IMER was followed by measurement of percent  deconjugation and the parameters investigated were: substrate concentration, pH  (4 to 6), temperature (r.t., 37 degrees C), enzyme-substrate contact time using  flow-rates of 0.1 to 1.0 min/min (15-1.5 min). The glucuronides used in the  evaluation of the BG-IMER were: 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide,  p-acetaminophen-beta-D-glucuronide,  3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-beta-D-glucuronide, phenyl-beta-D-glucuronide,  chloramphenicol-beta-D-glucuronide, estradiol-17-beta-D-glucuronide and  morphine-beta-D-glucuronide.

Morphine is an opioid commonly used in children to manage perioperative pain.  Al-though size and age often are considered primary covariates for morphine  pharmacokinetic models, the impact of other factors important in personalizing  care such as race and genetic variations on morphine disposition is not well  documented. DESIGN: Genotype blinded clinical observational pharmacokinetic  study. One hundred forty-six African American and Caucasian children scheduled  for elective outpatient adenotonsillectomy were enrolled in our prospective  genotype blinded observational study with standard perioperative clinical care.  SETTING: Tertiary care pediatric institution. INTERVENTIONS: Morphine bolus for  intraoperative analgesia in children and pharmacokinetic analyses in different  races. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of  intravenous morphine in a homogeneous pediatric outpatient surgical pain  population were evaluated. RESULTS: The authors observed that African American  children have higher morphine clearance than Caucasian children. The increased  clearance is directed toward the formation of morphine-3-glucuronide formation,  rather than the formation of morphine-6-glucuronide. Common uridine diphosphate  glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 2B7 genetic variations (2161C>T and 802C>T) were  not associated with observed racial differences in morphine's clearance although  the wild type of the UGT2B7 isozyme is more prevalent in the African Americans.  CONCLUSIONS: Race of the child is an important factor in perioperative  intravenous morphine's clearance and its potential role in personalizing  analgesia with morphine needs further investigation.","2012-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:28:22","","217-226","","4","8","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Sadhasivam2012a PMID: 22941849 place: United States","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Prospective Studies; Genotype; Child; Individuality; Pharmacogenetics/methods; Pain Measurement/methods; Glucuronosyltransferase/genetics/metabolism; White People/genetics; Black or African American/genetics; Morphine Derivatives/metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taken as directed, morphine provides analgesia while naltrexone remains  sequestered; if tampered with by crushing, naltrexone is released to mitigate  morphine-induced euphoric effects. While it is necessary to establish that  formulations intended to reduce attractiveness for abuse are successful in doing  so, it is also necessary to demonstrate that product therapeutic integrity is  maintained for patients. OBJECTIVES: Data were reviewed from 3 studies to  determine: 1) the quantity of naltrexone released when MS-sNT pellets are crushed  (MS-sNTC) for at least 2 minutes with mortar and pestle); 2) the extent to which  the naltrexone released upon crushing mitigated morphine-induced subjective  effects; and 3) whether sequestered naltrexone precipitates opioid withdrawal  when MS-sNT is taken as directed. METHODS: The naltrexone bioavailability study  compared naltrexone release from MS-sNTC with that from whole intact MS-sNT  capsules (MS-sNTW) and an equal naltrexone solution (NS) dose. Equivalent  bioavailability was established if 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for geometric  mean ratios (maximum plasma naltrexone concentration [Cmax] and area under the  concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity [AUC∞]) fell between 80% and  125%. The oral pharmacodynamic study assessed drug liking and euphoria and  pharmacokinetic properties of MS-sNTC and MS-sNTW compared with morphine sulfate  solution (MSS) and placebo. The 12-month, open-label (OL) safety study evaluated  safety of MS-sNT administered orally as directed in patients with chronic,  moderate-to-severe pain. Safety assessments included withdrawal symptoms based on  the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS). RESULTS: Naltrexone from MS-sNTC met  criteria for equivalent bioavailability to NS. Although morphine relative  bioavailability was similar for MS-sNTC and MSS, mean peak (Emax) visual analog  scale (VAS) scores for drug liking and Cole/Addiction Research Center Inventory  Stimulation-Euphoria were significantly reduced for MS-sNTC vs MSS (p < 0.001).  In these 2 studies, a total of 6 participants had one measurement of plasma  naltrexone after MS-sNTW that was above the lower limit of quantification. In the  OL safety study, 72/93 participants (77%) had no quantifiable naltrexone  concentrations. There was neither evidence of naltrexone accumulation for any  participant nor any significant correlation with MS-sNT dose, age, or sex. Of 4  participants with the highest naltrexone concentrations, none had COWS scores  consistent with moderate opioid withdrawal symptoms. Only 5 participants had COWS  scores consistent with moderate opioid withdrawal; all 5 had not taken MS-sNT as  directed. LIMITATIONS: Study populations may not be fully representative of  patients receiving opioid therapy for the management of chronic,  moderate-to-severe pain and of opioid abusers. CONCLUSIONS: When MS-sNT capsules  are crushed, all of the sequestered naltrexone (relative to oral NS) is released  and immediately available to mitigate morphine-induced effects. When MS-sNT was  crushed, the naltrexone released abated drug liking and euphoria relative to that  from an equal dose of immediate-release morphine from MSS administration in a  majority of participants. Naltrexone concentrations were low over a period of 12  months without evidence of accumulation, and there were no observable opioid  withdrawal symptoms when MS-sNT was taken as directed.","2011-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:26:32","","391-406","","4","14","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Johnson2011b PMID: 21785483 place: United States","","","","Humans; Area Under Curve; Biological Availability; Drug Combinations; Capsules; ROC Curve; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Naltrexone/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infants  received morphine after a loading dose of 0.05 mg/kg and continuous infusion  calculated to reach a steady-state concentration of 20 ng/mL. Blood was sampled  twice on Postoperative Day 1 at times separated by at least 2 h, and morphine and  morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G) concentrations were determined by high-performance  liquid chromatography. Clearance of morphine was calculated as infusion rate  divided by the steady-state morphine concentration. Morphine given to 26 infants  by continuous i.v. infusion after major noncardiac surgery has rapidly increasing  clearance values, from a median value of 9.2 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) in infants 1-7  days old, 25.3 in infants 31-90 days old, and 31.0 in infants 91-180 days old to  48.9 in infants 180-380 days old. Adult clearance values are reached by 1 mo of  age, more quickly than in infants of the same age previously studied who received  morphine after cardiac surgeries. M-6-G was measured in all infants. The ratio of  M-6-G to morphine concentrations was 1.9-2.1 in these infants, which is lower  than ratios reported in older infants or adults by others, but higher than those  reported in newborns. Infants with normal cardiovascular systems undergoing  surgery clear morphine more efficiently than infants of the same age undergoing  cardiac surgery. IMPLICATIONS: Morphine removal from the body is slow in newborns  but increases to reach adult values in the first months of life. Calculating the  clearance of morphine from blood samples drawn during continuous i.v. infusions  after surgery shows that this maturation occurs more quickly in infants  undergoing noncardiac surgery (by 1-3 mo of age) than in those receiving morphine  after cardiac surgery (by 6-12 mo of age).","1998-05","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:59:35","","958-963","","5","86","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Lynn1998a PMID: 9585276 place: United States","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Age Factors; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Infusions, Intravenous; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanical hyperalgesia was determined by measuring the withdrawal  threshold to a noxious mechanical stimulus applied to the paw and thermal  hyperalgesia as the withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus applied to  the plantar surface. A concentration of 1.0% carrageenan (intraplantar) reduced  mechanical thresholds from 124+/-5 to 63+/-3 g and thermal latencies from  19+/-0.4 to 4.7+/-0.9 s as determined 4 h after injection. The hyperalgesia  persisted for over 24 h. The NK(1) receptor antagonists, SDZ NKT 343, RPR100893  and SR140333, reduced mechanical hyperalgesia by 68, 36 and 27% at a dose of 30  mg kg(-1) p.o., respectively. No further reduction was noted at higher doses  (maximum 100 mg kg(-1) p.o.). The anti-hyperalgesic effect of SDZ NKT 343 and  RPR100893 peaked at 3 h while SR140333 produced maximal reversal at 1 h after  oral administration. D(30) values indicated significant differences between the  potency of these compounds. SDZ NKT 343 was by far the most potent  anti-hyperalgesic agent (D(30): 1.1 mg kg(-1)). The D(30) values for RPR100893  and SR140333 were estimated to be 17 and >100 mg kg(-1), respectively. In thermal  hyperalgesia, SDZ NKT 343 produced a significantly weaker anti-hyperalgesic  effect with a peak of 25% reversal. The D(30) value for SDZ NKT 343 was 3.89 mg  kg(-1). For comparison, morphine inhibited the carrageenan-induced mechanical and  thermal hyperalgesia with an ED(50) of 1.85 and 2.51 mg kg(-1) s.c.,  respectively. When tested up to 300 mg kg(-1) p.o., aspirin reduced  carrageenan-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia by 55.0 and 45.2%,  respectively. In addition to the anti-hyperalgesic effects of NK(1) receptor  antagonists, the effects of SDZ NKT 343 and RPR100893 on plasma protein  extravasation were measured in the FCA-treated knee joint of the guinea-pig. SDZ  NKT 343 reversed plasma protein extravasation 2 h after administration by 60% at  the oral dose of 30 mg kg(-1). RPR100893 was significantly less effective with a  maximum reversal of 30% at 100 mg kg(-1). In comparison, indomethacin produced a  50% reversal at a 10 mg kg(-1) dose. These experiments indicate that the  carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia in the guinea-pig may be predictive of analgesic  activity of NK(1) receptor antagonists in man. NK(1) receptor antagonists are  active anti-hyperalgesic drugs in both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the  guinea-pig. In addition they inhibit plasma protein extravasation in the same  species. The variability of in vivo potency and efficacy of the NK(1) receptor  antagonists in the mechanical hyperalgesia model is difficult to interpret as all  compounds are highly effective at blocking the NK(1) receptor in guinea-pig  tissues. Amongst several possibilities, differences in pharmacokinetics may  explain discrepancies.","2000-09","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:11:51","","253-263","","3","87","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Campbell2000a PMID: 10963905 place: United States","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Animals; Administration, Oral; Guinea Pigs; *Disease Models, Animal; Indoles/therapeutic use; Naphthalenes/*therapeutic use; Piperidines/therapeutic use; Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use; Isoindoles; Carrageenan; *Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists; Freund's Adjuvant; Hyperalgesia/chemically induced/*drug therapy; Proline/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Quinuclidines/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are currently no endogenous markers representing the metabolic activity and the extent of  portacaval shunts in patients with liver cirrhosis. The pharmacokinetic  properties of the applied drugs must therefore be taken into account when  adjusting the dose in patients with liver cirrhosis. For drugs with a high  degradation during the first passage across the liver (first-pass metabolism) the  bioavailability is going to increase and the clearance to decrease after oral  application. After topical, buccal or parenteral administration, only the  impaired clearance will play a role. For drugs with a high bioavailability (> 70  %) only the impaired hepatic clearance has to be considered.

It has been traditionally utilized to alleviate opiate  withdrawal symptoms. Besides consideration about potency and selectivity, a good  drug must possess a suitable pharmacokinetic profile, with suitable absorption,  distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME-Tox) profile, in order to  have a high chance of success in clinical trials. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The purity  of mitragynine in a Mitragyna speciosa alkaloid extract (MSAE) was determined  using Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography (UFLC). In vitro high throughput ADMETox  studies such as aqueous solubility, plasma protein binding, metabolic stability,  permeability and cytotoxicity tests were carried out to analyze the  physicochemical properties of MSAE and mitragynine. The UFLC quantification  revealed that the purity of mitragynine in the MSAE was 40.9%. RESULTS: MSAE and  mitragynine are highly soluble in aqueous solution at pH 4.0 but less soluble at  pH 7.4. A parallel artificial membrane permeability assay demonstrated that it is  extensively absorbed through the semi-permeable membrane at pH 7.4 but very  poorly at pH 4.0. Both are relatively highly bound to plasma proteins (> 85 %  bound) and are metabolically stable to liver microsomes (> 84 % remained  unchanged). In comparison to MSAE, mitragynine showed higher cytotoxicity against  WRL 68, HepG2 and Clone 9 hepatocytes after 72 h treatment. CONCLUSION: The  obtained ADME and cytotoxicity data demonstrated that both MSAE and mitragynine  have poor bioavailability and have the potential to be significantly cytotoxic.","2017","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 10:50:48","","796-803","","9","20","","Comb Chem High Throughput Screen","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.","","","","","","tex.ids= Kong2017 PMID: 29076424 place: United Arab Emirates","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Cell Line; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Structure-Activity Relationship; Chemistry, Physical; Solubility; cytotoxicity; Hep G2 Cells; Cell Proliferation/drug effects; Hepatocytes/drug effects; Water/chemistry; *High-Throughput Screening Assays; ADME-Tox; high throughput; Mitragyna speciosa alkaloid extract; Mitragyna/*chemistry; mitragynine; Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology; ultra-fast liquid chromatography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ciramadol glucuronidation was slower (Vmax, 1.56  vs. 5.40 nmol/min/mg of microsomal protein) in human than in dog liver  microsomes. Inhibition constants (Ki) for lorazepam and oxazepam were 3 to 4  times higher than that calculated for diazepam. Rates of morphine glucuronidation  in human liver microsomes were assessed for comparative purposes and agreed with  literature values. Each benzodiazepine appeared to be a competitive inhibitor of  ciramadol and morphine UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity. The in vivo  disposition of ciramadol was unchanged in dogs pretreated with lorazepam. After  diazepam treatment no change in the Vdss of ciramadol occurred, but plasma  clearance was significantly reduced, resulting in a prolongation of t1/2.  Diazepam caused a significant reduction in the oral clearance of ciramadol,  whereas no change occurred in systemic availability. Thus, diazepam may have had  a secondary effect on hepatic blood flow (QH) and produced offsetting alterations  in both intrinsic clearance (Cl int) and QH. A decrease in the area under the  plasma concentration time curves of ciramadol aryl O-glucuronide following iv  treatment with diazepam coupled with the in vitro data indicate that the  mechanism for the decrease in the clearance of ciramadol is inhibition of its  glucuronidation by diazepam. Since glucuronidation plays a major role in the  elimination of ciramadol in man and dog, these experiments suggest that the  disposition of ciramadol in man would not be affected by coadministration of  lorazepam, whereas the potential for a diazepam/ciramadol drug interaction in  humans exists.","1986-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:01:38","","430-436","","4","14","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Meacham1986a PMID: 2873990 place: United States","","","","Humans; Male; Kinetics; Animals; Drug Interactions; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Dogs; Biotransformation/drug effects; Microsomes, Liver/metabolism; Diazepam/pharmacology; Glucuronates/metabolism; Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology; Morphine/metabolism; Amines/*metabolism; Benzylamines/*metabolism; Lorazepam/pharmacology; Oxazepam/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the discrimination and plasma levels of ethanol with  naltrexone and morphine pretreatments. Rats were trained to discriminate ethanol  (1.5 g/kg; i.g.) from water, under a two-lever, food-reinforced procedure.  Ethanol and pentobarbital, but not amphetamine, substituted for ethanol in a  dose-related manner. Naltrexone reduced ethanol-induced, ethanol-appropriate  responding to about 35%, but the peripherally-acting antagonist, naltrexone  methobromide, was without effect. Morphine neither substituted for nor enhanced  ethanol-appropriate responding. Rather, ethanol-induced, ethanol-appropriate  responding was attenuated in a dose-related manner by morphine administration.  Neither naltrexone nor morphine altered ethanol-appropriate responding to the  substitution with pentobarbital. In another group of rats, both naltrexone and  morphine decreased plasma ethanol levels, and delayed the time of peak  concentrations, suggesting that opiates alter the behavioral effects of ethanol  through both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. The similarities  between an opioid agonist and an antagonist suggest that either naltrexone has  opioid agonist-like effects, or that these effects occur through non-opioidergic  mechanisms.","1999-02","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:51:21","","1-13","","1","10","","Behav Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Kosten1999a PMID: 10780298 place: England","","","","Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Rats, Inbred Lew; Hypnotics and Sedatives/pharmacology; Narcotics/*pharmacology; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Naltrexone/*pharmacology; Morphine/*pharmacology; Central Nervous System Depressants/*blood/*pharmacology; Discrimination, Psychological/*drug effects; Ethanol/*blood/*pharmacology; Pentobarbital/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  enhanced response to morphine could not be explained on the basis of any of the  pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine in the serum. In order to determine the  possible contribution of altered distribution of morphine in the central nervous  system in the differences in the pharmacological response to morphine in the two  strains, the time course of the distribution of morphine was determined in brain  regions and spinal cord after its i.v. administration. SHR and WKY rats were  injected with morphine (10 mg/kg). At various times (5, 30, 60, 120 and 360 min)  after the injection of morphine, brain regions (hypothalamus, cortex,  hippocampus, midbrain, pons and medulla, striatum and amygdala) and spinal cord  were collected. The level of morphine in the tissues was determined by using a  highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay method. Five minutes after  morphine injection, the concentration of morphine was the highest in the spinal  cord. Among the brain regions, the highest concentration of morphine was in the  hypothalamus and the lowest in the amygdala. In all the brain regions and spinal  cord, the concentration of morphine was significantly higher in the SHR than in  the WKY rats. Similar effects were observed at 30, 60 and 120 min after morphine  injection.

Twenty patients were randomly allocated to one of the  two study groups to receive either an intravenous CCiA or PCAM regimen. Pain  scores measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) and the number of valid demands  were used as variables to evaluate the efficacy of the postoperative analgesic  therapy. In addition, the bias and inaccuracy of the pharmacokinetic data set of  alfentanil used in the CCiA program were examined by determining the median  performance error (MDPE), and the median absolute performance error (MDAPE). The  onset of satisfactory analgesia was faster (P < 0.05) in the CCiA group (median:  20 min) than in the PCAM group (median: 50 min). The total number of demands was  lower (21 vs 34, P < 0.05) and the time when the VAS score was > 3.0 was shorter  (P < 0.05, 12% of the time) in the CCiA group than in the PCAM group (21% of the  time). The MDPE and MDAPE were 8% and 22%, respectively. The maximum alfentanil  concentrations associated with pain and the minimum effective analgesic  concentrations of alfentanil varied considerably both inter- and  intraindividually.

ED50  values for morphine- and sufentanil-induced antinociception were determined in  the paw-lift assay on days 10 and 27. The ED50 for morphine analgesia in  10-day-old pups was 0.35 mg/kg and increased with age to 5.3 mg/kg on day 27.  Similarly, sufentanil was more potent in pups than in weanlings, the ED50  increasing from 1.7 to 7.6 micrograms/kg. Serum and brain morphine levels after 5  mg/kg of morphine were higher in neonates (day 10) than weanlings (day 27),  largely due to a more rapid redistribution phase in weanlings (T1/2 = 26 min.)  than in pups (T1/2 = 2.5 hr). Additionally, a substantial (70%) antinociceptive  response was achieved in neonates at brain morphine levels that were one-half  those producing an equal effect in weanlings. Radioligand binding studies  indicated that the number of mu receptors increased 2-fold without change in  affinity between days 10 and 27, whereas the GTP analog guanylylimidophosphate  was nearly twice as effective in shifting the mu receptors from high to low  affinity on day 27 than on day 10. These data indicate that neonatal rats are  more sensitive to mu opiate antinociception despite apparently weaker  receptor-guanyl nucleotide binding protein coupling. This greater sensitivity is  enhanced by the pharmacokinetic differences between neonates and weanlings which  result in higher drug levels in pups after a similar dose.","1995-06","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:21:30","","1353-1360","","3","273","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Windh1995a PMID: 7791108 place: United States","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Molecular Sequence Data; Amino Acid Sequence; Brain/metabolism; Animals, Newborn; Receptors, Opioid, mu/agonists/*metabolism; Analgesics/*metabolism; GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism; Morphine/blood/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not clear whether an active CYP2D6 enzyme is required for opioid  receptor-mediated effects in man after standard dihydrocodeine doses. METHODS:  Whole cell opioid-receptor affinity and effects on cAMP accumulation of  dihydrocodeine and its metabolites were determined in differentiated SH-SY5Y  neuroblastoma cells. In a double-blind, 2-period, placebo-controlled randomized  crossover pilot study the pharmacokinetics of dihydrocodeine (60 mg single dose)  and its metabolites were examined in 5 phenotyped extensive (EMs) and 4 poor  metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2D6, and pharmacodynamics were evaluated using a pain  threshold model and dynamic pupillometry. RESULTS: Displacement binding and cAMP  accumulation experiments showed clearly higher affinities (100- and 50-fold) and  activities (180- and 250-fold) of dihydromorphine and  dihydromorphine-6-glucuronide, respectively, whereas the other metabolites had  similar or lower affinities and activities as compared to dihydrocodeine. The  clinical study revealed no significant difference in plasma or urine  pharmacokinetics between EMs and PMs for dihydrocodeine and its glucuronide.  Dihydromorphine and its glucuronides were detectable in EMs only. A clear  reduction of initial pupil diameters was observed up to 6 hours postdose in both  PMs and EMs, with no obvious differences between CYP2D6 phenotypes. In the pain  threshold model no effects were observed in either group.

The aim of this study was to determine  whether CTAP can enter the central nervous system (CNS) by crossing either the  blood-brain barrier or the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (CSF) and to  characterize the mechanism of CNS entry. CNS entry of [3H]CTAP was compared with  that of the vascular space marker [14C]inulin and the mu-agonist [3H]morphine. By  using an in situ brain perfusion technique coupled to high-performance liquid  chromatographic analysis, greater amounts of radioactivity were detected in the  brain or CSF at most time points for [3H]CTAP, compared with [14C]inulin.  [3H]CTAP was found to remain predominantly intact in the brain after a 20-min rat  brain perfusion (62.8%). CTAP was also stable in the blood and serum of rats  (T1/2 > 500 min), showing that the structure of this peptide offers enzymatic  resistance. Additionally, [3H]CTAP was found to be extensively protein-bound to  albumin in the perfusion medium (68.2%) and to proteins in rat serum (84.2%).  Entry into the brain and CSF was not inhibited by the addition of unlabeled CTAP  to the perfusion medium, suggesting that passage into the CNS is most likely  through diffusion across the membranes that comprise the blood-brain barrier,  rather than by saturable transport. Also, greater amounts of [3H]morphine entered  both the brain and CSF after a 20-min brain perfusion, compared with [3H]CTAP.  The increased CNS penetration observed for [3H]morphine, compared with [3H]CTAP,  is likely due to the increased lipophilicity of morphine, as shown by its higher  octanol/saline partition coefficient. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile, CTAP  may be a promising mu-selective antagonist that can be used as a treatment for  opiate overdose or addiction and also as a pharmacological tool to further  understand opioid neurobiology.","1997-01","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-15 10:36:00","","402-409","","1","280","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8996221","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Mice; Protein Binding; Biological Availability; Permeability; Solubility; Peptide Fragments; Somatostatin; *Blood-Brain Barrier; Inulin/pharmacokinetics; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Narcotics/*pharmacokinetics; Peptides/pharmacokinetics; Receptors, Opioid, mu/*antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The sensitivity of the model was  tested with a broad range of drugs, including mu-opioid agonist (morphine),  kappa-opioid agonist (nalbuphine), three non-opioid analgesics (acetaminophen,  ketorprofen and indomethacin) and two non-analgesics (droperidol and diazepam).  Furthermore, PK and PD studies of nalbuphine (chosen as an example of analgesics)  were performed. RESULTS: The authors found that the PPT in rabbits recognized the  antinociceptive activities of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics with no  positive response to non-analgesics. AD50s determined by the PPT in rabbits for  morphine and nalbuphine were 3.1 and 8.4 mg/kg, respectively. In the PK and PD  studies, the plasma concentration time profiles of nalbuphine were well fitted to  a linear two-compartment open model, and the correlation between pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics was significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results  suggest that the PPT in rabbits can be used extensively to explore the analgesic  effects (PD) of a broad range of analgesics. Also, with this model, PK and PD  studies of analgesics can be easily performed.","1996-03","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:46:14","","1-8","","1","34","","Acta Anaesthesiol Sin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Hu1996a PMID: 9084512 place: China (Republic : 1949- )","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; Pain Measurement; *Disease Models, Animal; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphine or M6G (25-67 mumol/kg) was given subcutaneously, and blood  and striatal dialysate were sampled repeatedly during 120 min. Blood samples were  obtained by indwelling catheters in the inferior vena cava. Opiates in serum or  brain dialysate were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography. The  functional intactness of the blood-brain barrier was verified by the use of  sodium technetate (Na99mTcO4). The fractional penetration into the brain of  morphine and M6G was approximately 350- and 90-fold higher than that of  Na99mTcO4, respectively, with a relative difference in the transfer of morphine  and M6G of about 4. No hydrolysis of M6G to morphine was detected. Striatal  dialysate-to-serum ratios of M6G did not differ after 25 or 67 mumol/kg. Serum  AUC0-120 min was 10 times higher for M6G than for morphine. This reflects both a  smaller volume of distribution (Vd) for M6G and a decreased rate of elimination  compared with morphine. The median t1/2 from serum was 36 and 32 min for morphine  and M6G, respectively. The striatal dialysate AUC0-120 min of M6G was 2.9 times  greater than that of morphine after an equimolar subcutaneous dose. Dialysate  tmax was delayed approximately 40 min relatie to serum tmax for both drugs, and  the median t1/2 from the dialysate was 82 and 48 min for M6G and morphine,  respectively. These results represent direct evidence for the penetration of M6G  into the brain after systemic administration to living rats.","1995-10","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-15 10:35:58","","435-441","","1","275","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7562582","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Half-Life; Rats, Wistar; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Tissue Distribution; Motor Activity; Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiology; Microchemistry; Dialysis; Morphine Derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Corpus Striatum/metabolism; Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m; Wakefulness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further  evaluation of one of these systems by measurement of the rate of excretion of  radioactivity after administration of radiolabelled naltrexone in the delivery  system confirmed that significant release occurs for a time period of about 15  days. Electron capture gas-liquid chromatographic assays for naltrexone and  naloxone in plasma or urine have been developed that yield linear calibration  curves and are sensitive to one ng/ml.

Results indicated that plasma concentrations of both codeine and morphine  steadily decreased from day 7 to 16 months and then rebounded at 24 months.  Results also indicated that plasma concentrations of both codeine and morphine  correlated well with the amounts of codeine added to the feed. Bioavailability of  codeine using the dosed feed route increased with dose, varying from 10% to 25%,  which was somewhat higher than the previously reported approximately 8%  bioavailability using the gavage route. Concentrations of conjugated codeine were  very low, whereas concentrations of conjugated morphine were very high.

The goal of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of codeine with and without quinidine between Caucasian and  Chinese extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin. Nine Caucasians and eight Chinese  subjects received in random, double blind fashion, on two occasions, codeine 120  mg. with placebo or with quinidine 100 mg. Pharmacodynamic effects were  determined over 6 h. Codeine-apparent clearance and partial metabolic clearance  by O-demethylation were significantly greater in the Caucasian than in the  Chinese subjects (1939 +/- 175 ml/min versus 1301 +/- 193 ml/min, p <.03 and  162.7 +/- 36.6 ml/min versus 52.7 +/- 12.7 ml/min, p <.02, respectively).  Codeine's respiratory effects (except on resting ventilation) were significantly  greater in the Caucasian than in the Chinese subjects (p <.05), but no  interethnic differences were noted in codeine's effect on the digit symbol  substitution test and pupillary ratio. No morphine or morphine metabolites were  detected in plasma when codeine was coadministered with quinidine. Codeine  O-demethylation was significantly reduced after quinidine in both ethnic groups;  however, the absolute decrease was greater in Caucasians (115.8 +/- 25.9 ml/min  versus 46.8 +/- 10.6 ml/min, respectively, p <.03). The diminished production of  morphine after quinidine was associated in the Caucasians, but not in the  Chinese, with a marked reduction in codeine's effects (p <.01). In conclusion,  Chinese produce less morphine from codeine, exhibit reduced sensitivity to that  morphine, and therefore might experience reduced analgesic effect in response to  codeine. In addition, quinidine induced inhibition of codeine O-demethylation is  ethnically dependent with the reduction being greater in Caucasians.","1999-07","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:12:29","","413-422","","1","290","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Caraco1999a PMID: 10381807 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Double-Blind Method; Drug Interactions; Biotransformation; Cross-Over Studies; Dealkylation; Psychomotor Performance/drug effects; Debrisoquin/metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Asian People; White People; Morphine/metabolism; Pupil/drug effects; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Codeine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Quinidine/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Respiratory Mechanics/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of our studies was to examine whether these  male-female differences might be due to differences in the blood and brain levels  of morphine attained after its s.c. injection rather than to intrinsic  differences in the central nervous system sensitivity to the drug. Our results  confirmed that males were considerably more sensitive than females to the  antinociceptive properties of morphine on the hot-plate test; the ED50 in males  was approximately half that found in females. These sex differences were not  unique to morphine because males were also more sensitive to the antinociceptive  properties of the potent mu agonist, alfentanil. With respect to the  pharmacokinetics of morphine, we found that there was a linear relationship in  both males and females between the dose of morphine injected and the blood and  brain levels achieved 60 min after the injection when the sex-linked differences  in morphine-induced antinociception was greatest; no sex differences were found  in the peak levels of morphine attained in blood or brain at any dose of  morphine. Furthermore, there were no sex-linked differences in the elimination  half-life of morphine from blood and, similarly, there were no differences in the  disappearance of morphine from brain. On the basis of these data, it appears that  the sex-related differences we have observed between males and females in the  response to morphine's antinociceptive activity cannot be explained by  differences in the pharmacokinetics of morphine. Rather, it appears that sex  differences in morphine-induced antinociception are related to inherent  differences in the sensitivity of the brain to morphine.","1997-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:14:25","","939-944","","2","282","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Cicero1997a PMID: 9262361 place: United States","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Half-Life; Brain/*metabolism; *Sex Factors; Receptors, Opioid, mu/agonists; Analgesics, Opioid/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Morphine/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Alfentanil/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drugs metabolized by these enzymes or mu receptor competitors can modify the  action of methadone. Genetic polymorphism influences plasma concentrations of the  active levo enantiomer and thus clinical efficacy. ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS:  Rifampicin lowers methadome plasma levels so dose must be adapted. Rifabutin does  not affect methadone kinetics. ANTI-EPILEPSY DRUGS: Phenytoin lowers blood levels  of methadone by about 50% in 3 to 4 days. Other anti-epilepsy enzyme inducers  (phenobarbital, carbamazepine) increase methadone metabolism. ANTI-VIRAL DRUGS:  The area under the curve of plasma concentrations of zidovudine in presence of  methadone increase by 43%, increasing the risk of undesirable effects.  PSYCHOTROPES: Plasma levels of methadone increase by 20 to 100% in the presence  of fluvoxamine. The benzodiazepine-methadone combination can be fatal due to  respiratory depression. OTHER DRUGS: Brupenophine is a methadone agonist at the  dose of 1 and 2 mg. Chronic alcoholism reduces the area under the curve while  acute alcoholism increases it.

Ensysce has designed prodrug analogs of the commonly used pain  medications including hydromorphone, oxycodone (OC), hydrocodone, and morphine  that limit their use to oral delivery, two of which are in clinical development.  This study was undertaken to demonstrate that PF614, an extended-release prodrug  of OC, allows the release of OC as designed when delivered orally, yet it resists  ex vivo extraction with household chemicals and is pharmacologically inactive  when administered by nonoral routes (nasal and parenteral), thereby substantially  reducing its intravenous (IV) and intranasal abuse potential. METHODS: In vitro  and in vivo methods were used to determine release of OC from PF614 and to show  potential µ-opioid receptor activity. Plasma and cerebral spinal fluid levels of  OC were evaluated following in vivo IV administration of PF614 in rats. In vitro  extraction of OC from PF614 was explored using enzymes, common solvents, and  household chemicals at room temperature and elevated temperature over time to  determine release of OC from the prodrug. RESULTS: PF614 was stable with in vitro  exposure to human plasma, saliva, and liver microsomes or culinary enzyme  preparations. PF614 was stable (≥90 percent remaining as intact prodrug) under  all room temperature conditions evaluated for 24 hours. At 80°C for 1 hour, no OC  was released. Incubation at 80°C for 24 hours in vinegar or vodka produced a  conversion to OC of 6 percent. Incubation with trypsin at 37°C converted PF614  approximately stoichiometric to OC with half-life of 4 hours. PF614's penetration  of the central nervous system was 83-fold lower than OC and it had a 6.5-fold  reduced potency as a µ-opioid agonist. Finally, oral PF614 delivers OC into  plasma with an extended-release profile in dogs (reduced C(max); delayed T(max)).  CONCLUSIONS: The Bio-Activated Molecular Delivery prodrug design limits the use  of PF614 to the intended oral route of delivery with reduced potential for IV or  nasal abuse, as it cannot be activated intravenously or nasally to provide an  active opioid. Unlike existing opioid formulations, the extended-release profile  of PF614 cannot be accelerated by chewing or ex vivo extraction to  pharmacologically active substances.","2017-02","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:49:53","","39-49","","1","13","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Kirkpatrick2017a PMID: 28345745 place: United States","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Dogs; Binding Sites; Saliva/metabolism; Drug Stability; Microsomes, Liver/metabolism; Receptors, Opioid, mu/metabolism; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Liberation; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Oxycodone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Opioid-Related Disorders/*prevention & control; Prodrugs/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consistent with previous two-bottle choice  experiments, C57 mean (+/- S.D.) morphine consumption was 18 +/- 3 mg/kg/day,  while the DBA mice consumed 1.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg/day. Intraperitoneal naltrexone  produced a 50% decrease in C57 morphine consumption (p < 0.01), while DBA mice  showed no change. Consumption of fluid from the control bottle was not changed  for either strain. Fifteen and 30 min after oral consumption of a morphine  solution, plasma levels of morphine and its glucuronide derivative were not  different between these two strains. C57 mice maintained a daily morphine intake  of approximately 20 mg/kg across morphine concentrations of 0.05-0.4 mg/ml.

Antinociceptive effect, as measured by the tail-flick latency, was studied  over 8 days in rats that received continuous i.v. infusion of 1) 22 mg/kg/day of  morphine, 2) 20 mg/kg/day of fenfluramine, 3) both drugs concomitantly or 4)  saline. Infusion with morphine alone resulted in a peak analgesia of 100% maximal  possible effect, which declined with time; full tolerance was reached by day 4.  Fenfluramine treatment alone had no effect. Fenfluramine coinfusion attenuated  the development of tolerance to morphine; >70% maximal possible effect was still  present on day 4. The effect of fenfluramine coinfusion occurred in the absence  of a significant increase in plasma or brain morphine concentration, or a  decrease in the accumulation of morphine's putative antagonistic metabolite,  morphine-3-glucuronide. In another set of infusion experiments, rats were  challenged with a single i.p. dose of morphine to characterize the morphine  dose-response curves at 10 hr following 4-day i.v. infusion of 1) 22 mg/kg/day of  morphine, 2) 20 mg/kg/day fenfluramine, 3) morphine plus fenfluramine or 4)  saline. An acute i. p. morphine challenge dose response experiment was also  conducted in naïve control rats and in rats receiving a concomitant i.p.  injection of fenfluramine (2.4 mg/kg). Coinjection of fenfluramine acutely  potentiated the antinociceptive potency of morphine. However, potentiation alone  does not fully account for the apparent attenuation of tolerance during morphine  i.v. infusion. ED50 of morphine was elevated to 7.0 mg/kg in the morphine-infused  rats compared to 2.4 mg/kg in saline-infused rats. Coinfusion of fenfluramine  increased ED50 to only 3.7 mg/kg. These results demonstrate that fenfluramine  significantly attenuates tolerance development to morphine by modulating the  pharmacological process responsible for tolerance development to morphine.","1998-08","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-20 11:37:16","","585-592","","2","286","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Arends1998a PMID: 9694907 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Reaction Time/drug effects; Stereoisomerism; Drug Tolerance; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Morphine/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Fenfluramine/*pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In 18 patients with FM muscle pain to i.v.  administration of morphine (0.3 mg/kg), lidocaine (5 mg/kg), ketamine (0.3  mg/kg), or saline was studied. Spontaneous pain intensity, muscle strength,  static muscle endurance, pressure pain threshold, and pain tolerance at tender  points and non-tender point areas were followed. Drug plasma concentrations and  effects on physical functioning ability score (FIQ) were recorded. A personality  inventory (KSP) was used to related pain response to personality traits. RESULTS:  Thirteen patients responded to one or several of the drugs, but not to placebo.  Two patients were placebo responders responding to all 4 infusions. Three were  nonresponders responding to no infusions. Seven of the responders had a reduction  in pain for 1-5 days. Pressure pain threshold and pain tolerance increased  significantly in responders. Plasma concentrations were similar in responders and  nonresponders. FIQ values improved significantly after the ketamine infusion.  Responders scored higher on KSP scales for somatic anxiety, muscular tension, and  psychasthenia compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSION: FM diagnosed according  to the American College of Rheumatology criteria seems to include patients with  different pain processing mechanisms.

The Japanese journal of anesthesiology","","0021-4892","","","The mechanism of action of aspirin as an analgesic is an inhibition of biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Thus the site of action has been believed to be  peripheral. However, when aspirin is injected intra- thecally, it produces an  analgesic effect. Aspirin has a membrane-stabilizing effect and it is used  locally for the treatment of post- herpetic neuralgia. Epidural opioids are  frequently used for the management of post-operative pain or cancer pain.  Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that delayed respiratory depression results  from migration of morphine in the cerebrospinal fluid to the brain. Peak  concentrations of morphine near the brain stem occur about 3 hours after lumbar  epidural injection, whereas lipophilic opioids such as meperidine, peak  concentration occur within 30 to 60 minutes. The clearance from cerebrospinal  fluid of lipophilic opioids is more rapid than that of morphine. Besides opioids,  alpha 2 receptor agonists such as clonidine also have analgesic action when  administered into the epidural space. Somatostatin is one of many neuropeptides  found in the spinal cord. It has dual action: a mediation of thermal nociception  and a general antinociceptive action. When somatostatin is administered  intrathecally or epidurally, it produces analgesic effect and its efficacy  appears to be equal to that of morphine.","1989-02","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:22:21","","152-156","","2","38","","Masui","","","","","","","","jpn","","","","","","","tex.ids= Yamamura1989a PMID: 2567360 place: Japan","","","","Humans; Pain/*drug therapy; Aspirin/therapeutic use; Analgesics/*therapeutic use; Injections, Epidural; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Opium/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Somatostatin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study. SETTING:  Single center. PATIENTS: Fourteen patients with chronic moderate-to-severe  noncancer pain receiving opioids were enrolled into the study; six completed the  maintenance and treatment phases prior to early study discontinuation for issues  with manufacturing; eight discontinued: adverse effects (4), noncompliance (1),  patient decision (1), study termination (2).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale  (COWS). RESULTS: Clinically significant withdrawal (COWS ≥ 13) was observed with  rapid onset (≤0.8 hours postdose) in three patients (50 percent) following  treatment with crushed MSN at the highest doses administered of ≥60/2.4 mg.  Although naltrexone exposure was negligible following exposure to intact MSN,  increasing plasma levels of naltrexone and 6-β-naltrexol were associated with  COWS score ≥13 in patients who received crushed MSN. COWS ≥ 13 was observed in  one patient receiving intact MSN without quantifiable naltrexone concentrations.  CONCLUSION: Crushing the MSN capsule may precipitate moderate-to-severe signs and  symptoms of opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals.

Levels were determined by  radioimmunoassay. Milk codeine levels ranged from 33.8 to 314 ng/ml 20 to 240  minutes after codeine; morphine levels ranged from 1.9 to 20.5 ng/ml. Infant  plasma samples one to four hours after feeding had codeine levels ranging from <  0.8 to 4.5 ng/ml; morphine ranged from < 0.5 to 2.2 ng/ml. Low infant plasma  levels are secondary to low excretion into milk and the small amounts of milk  available in the first few days. Moderate codeine use during this time (< or =  four 60 mg doses) is probably safe.","1993-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:01:51","","237-240","","4","9","","J Hum Lact","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Meny1993a PMID: 8260056 place: United States","","","","Humans; Female; Pain/*drug therapy; Pregnancy; Sampling Studies; Radioimmunoassay; Milk, Human/*chemistry; Infant, Newborn/*blood; *Breast Feeding; Codeine/*analysis/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Puerperal Disorders/*drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ovine CRH has a half-life, which is about three times  longer than that of human CRH and results in long lasting ACTH- and cortisol  responses. Plasma ACTH- and cortisol rises after administration of human CRH  mimic the spontaneously occurring secretory episodes of these hormones in man.  Pulsatile administration of human CRH restores the diurnal secretory pattern of  ACTH and cortisol to normal in patients with apparent CRH deficiency. Facial and  upper body flush occur in about 20% of patients receiving intravenously a 1  microgram/kg dose of CRH. Higher doses result in hypotension due to a decrease in  peripheral vascular resistance. The latter is primarily due to dilatation of the  superior mesenteric vessels. In in vitro models desensitization of the pituitary  corticotroph by continuous, high-dose CRH administration occurs. No  down-regulation of ACTH- and cortisol secretion has been shown in vivo, however.  Pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to CRH can be modulated by many factors. These  factors are involved in the basal regulation of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in its activation during the stress  response. Such factors include AVP, morphine, DAMME, and drugs modulating the  endogenous serotoninergic and GABA/benzodiazepine system. Glucocorticoid feedback  inhibition of the pituitary is one of the most important factors modulating ACTH-  and cortisol responses to CRH. A negative correlation exists between the net  ACTH- and cortisol response to exogenous CRH and the basal cortisol plasma  concentration. Replacement doses of glucocorticoid result in a drastic decrease  of basal plasma concentrations of cortisol and adrenal androgens.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1987","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 07:13:12","","24-30","","","16","","Horm Metab Res Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Schurmeyer1987a PMID: 2832286 place: Germany","","","","Humans; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Tolerance; Sheep; Hydrocortisone/metabolism; Pituitary Gland/drug effects/physiology; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Glucocorticoids/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A low-dose intraoperative infusion of the  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine did not result in  reduced postoperative morphine consumption after remifentanil-based anesthesia in  adolescents. This study investigates the potential role of the glutamate-nitric  oxide-cyclic guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) pathway in the failure of  low-dose ketamine to prevent remifentanil-induced acute opioid tolerance and/or  hyperalgesia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial at a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS,  PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-four adolescents receiving  remifentanil-based anesthesia for surgical correction of idiopathic scoliosis  were randomly assigned to receive either intraoperative ketamine administered as  a bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 mL of normal saline and a continuous intravenous  infusion of 4.0 microg/kg/min or an equal volume of saline. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: Blood samples were collected before and after the administration of  ketamine for analyzing the concentrations of cyclic GMP, ketamine, and  norketamine. Blood samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid  chromatography and an enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The median (interquartile  range) value of the concentration of plasma cyclic GMP decreased from 23.7  (17.4-26.7) to 14.8 (14.0-17.3) nmol/L after ketamine infusion (p < 0.005) and  from 23.9 (16.3-29.2) to 163 (14.5-18.6) nmol/L after saline infusion (p <  0.005). The median value of the concentration of plasma cyclic GMP at the end of  ketamine infusion did not differ significantly when compared with that after  saline infusion (p = 0.07). The concentration of plasma cyclic GMP was inversely  correlated with the concentration of plasma ketamine (r = -0.61). CONCLUSIONS:  This study suggests that the low dose of intraoperative ketamine infused was  insufficient to suppress the NMDA receptor pathway. The concentrations of plasma  cyclic GMP may serve as an indirect biological marker of ketamine-induced NMDA  receptor antagonism.","2011-12","2023-11-15 10:01:37","2023-11-26 06:31:15","","462-466","","6","7","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Engelhardt2011a PMID: 22320028 place: United States","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Prospective Studies; Double-Blind Method; Injections, Intravenous; Infusions, Intravenous; Child; Hospitals, University; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Drug Tolerance; Nitric Oxide/metabolism; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors; Remifentanil; Pain, Postoperative/prevention & control; Anesthetics, Dissociative/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Anesthetics, Intravenous/adverse effects/pharmacology; Cyclic GMP/*blood; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Glutamic Acid/metabolism; Ketamine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Piperidines/*adverse effects/pharmacology; Scoliosis/surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans  and rats, part of the analgesic effect of morphine has been attributed to the  active metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Although morphine can cause  several undesirable effects, M6G has a more favorable safety profile. The  objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics, tissue  distribution, and behavioral and select physiological effects of M6G following  intravenous administration to a small group of horses. In Part 1 of the study, 3  horses received a single intravenous administration of saline, 0.5 mg/kg body  weight (BW) M6G, or 0.5 mg/kg BW morphine in a 3-way crossover design. Blood  samples were collected up to 96 hours post-administration, concentrations of drug  and metabolites measured, and pharmacokinetics determined. Behavioral and  physiological effects were then recorded. In Part 2 of the study, 2 horses  scheduled to be euthanized for other reasons, were administered 0.5 mg/kg BW M6G.  Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and various tissue samples were collected  post-administration and concentrations of drug were determined. The clearance of  M6G was more rapid and the volume of distribution at steady state was smaller for  M6G compared to morphine. A reaction characterized by head shaking, pawing, and  slight ataxia was observed immediately following administration of both morphine  and M6G to horses. After M6G administration, these behaviors subsided rapidly and  were followed by a longer period of sedation. Following administration, M6G was  detected in the kidney, liver, CSF, and regions of the brain. Results of this  study encourage further investigation of M6G in order to assess its clinical  feasibility as an analgesic in horses.","2022-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","172-180","","3","86","","Can J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright and/or publishing rights held by the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association.","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 35794968  PMCID: PMC9251799","","","","Animals; Rats; Tissue Distribution; Horses; *Glucuronides; Administration, Intravenous/veterinary; Morphine/pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacokinetics; *Analgesics, Opioid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN:  Randomized balanced crossover study. ANIMALS: A total of seven University-owned  horses, five mares and two geldings, aged 3-6 years. METHODS: Horses were treated  with a single intravenous dosage of saline, morphine (0.2 mg kg(-1)), M6G (0.01  mg kg(-1)) and M3G (0.03 mg kg(-1)). Blood was collected prior to (baseline) and  at several times post administration. Drug and metabolite concentrations were  determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and plasma  pharmacokinetics were calculated. Behavioral observations and physiologic  variables (heart rate, step counts, packed cell volume, total plasma protein and  gastrointestinal sounds) were determined at baseline and for up to 6 hours. The  effects on thermal nociception were determined and thermal excursion was  calculated. RESULTS: The volumes of distribution were 4.75-10.5, 0.244-0.295 and  0.215-0.356 L kg(-1) for morphine, M6G and M3G, respectively. Systemic clearances  were 26.8-39.6, 3.16-3.88 and 1.46-2.13 mL minute(-1) kg(-1) for morphine, M6G  and M3G, respectively.

The alkaloid codeine contained therein via biotransformation  converts to morphine and potentially produces addictive and toxic effects. Due to  the healthy concern for a pregnant woman, our hypothesis is that codeine and its  metabolites can penetrate the placental barrier to reach the foetus and amniotic  fluid, and these processes may be modulated by the transporter. AIM OF THE STUDY:  Because codeine is also considered a prodrug of morphine, it has a good analgesic  effect. It is often used by pregnant women but may expose the foetus to the risk  of morphine harm. The aim of this study is to investigate the metabolic rate,  distribution and transplacental transfer mechanism of codeine and its metabolites  morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) in pregnant rats and to assess the risk  of medication for pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrahigh-performance  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) combined with a  microdialysis system was developed to monitor codeine, morphine and M3G in  multiple sites of maternal blood, placenta, foetus and amniotic fluid after  codeine administration. A compartmental model was used to calculate the  pharmacokinetic parameters of codeine in blood after codeine administration  (10 mg/kg, i.v.). The area under the concentration (AUC) ratio of  AUC(metabolite)/AUC(codeine) and AUC(tissue)/AUC(blood) was used to represent the  metabolic biotransformation ratio and the drug from blood-to-tissue transfer  ratio, respectively. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic results demonstrated that  codeine fit well with a two-compartment model and went through rapid metabolism  to morphine and M3G in pregnant rats after codeine administration (10 mg/kg,  i.v.). The biotransformation ratios of AUC(morphine)/AUC(codeine),  AUC(M3G)/AUC(morphine) and AUC(M3G)/AUC(codeine) were 0.12 ± 0.03, 54.45 ± 20.61  and 6.53 ± 2.47, respectively, after codeine administration (10 mg/kg, i.v.),  which suggested that codeine was easily metabolized into M3G through morphine.  The tissue distribution results demonstrated that all of the analytes penetrated  into the foetus through the placenta; however, the blood-to-tissue transfer ratio  (AUC(tissue)/AUC(blood)) of morphine and M3G was relatively lower than that of  codeine after codeine administration (10 mg/kg, i.v.), which suggested that the  blood-placenta barrier blocks the penetration of morphine and M3G into the  foetus. Thus, the tissue transfer of morphine in the placenta and foetus was  significantly enhanced by treatment with corticosterone, an inhibitor of organic  cation transporter (OCT). CONCLUSION: Based on microdialysis coupled to a  validated UHPLC-MS/MS system, the pharmacokinetics and metabolic  biotransformation of codeine and its metabolites were analyzed and clarified. The  potential mechanism of morphine placental transfer was modulated by OCT  transporters.","2022-11-15","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","115623","","","298","","J Ethnopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Development of sensitive  radioimmunoassays (RIA) and high-performance liquid chromatography in the past 20  years has allowed study of the pharmacokinetics of M, which remain incompletely  understood. Data derived by RIA must be interpreted with caution due to  cross-reactivity with anti-sera by metabolites, impairing assay specificity. The  pharmacokinetics of M have been determined for various clinical situations, but  there is large interpatient variability for most parameters. M is readily  absorbed from all routes of administration, except transdermal, and it can be  injected spinally. Peak plasma levels are achieved within 15-20 min of  intramuscular and subcutaneous administration, and within 30-90 min after oral.  Peak levels after oral administration are much lower than after parenteral  routes, since oral M undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. With  repeated administration, the oral-parenteral relative potency ratio is 1:3 M can  be administered epidurally or intrathecally and has also been given  intracerebroventricularly. Epidural M enters the subarachnoid space, but is also  absorbed into the systemic circulation. Only 5% of a dose crosses the dura. M  administered in the lumbar region is quickly redistributed in the cerebrospinal  fluid in a rostral direction, explaining the high incidence of systemic side  effects following spinal administration. After absorption, M is rapidly and  widely distributed and crosses the blood-brain barrier. With therapeutic doses,  plasma protein binding is only 20-35%, and the volume of distribution is 1-6  L/kg. The primary site of M metabolism is the liver, and the dose should be  reduced in patients with liver disease. Glucuronidation is the main metabolic  pathway, but the principal metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), is inactive.  Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) is produced in smaller amounts than M3G, but is  pharmacologically active and many times more potent than M. The ratio of M6G to M  in plasma, after a dose of M, is approximately 10:1, and the ratio does not  change with increasing doses or prolonged treatment. Normorphine (NM) is also  active, and is formed to a greater extent after oral administration; it is not,  however, usually found in plasma. NM may be neurotoxic. M and its metabolites are  excreted by the kidney, but urinary free M accounts for less than 10% of an  administered dose.

The kidneys were perfused with  Krebs-Henseleit buffer (pH 7.4) containing albumin, glucose, and amino acids, and  drug concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography.  There was no conversion of morphine to the glucuronides or deconjugation of M3G  or M6G. At an initial morphine concentration of 100 ng/ml, the unbound renal  clearance to glomerular filtration rate ratio (CLur/GFR) was 5.5 +/- 3.2 (mean  +/- SD), indicating that net tubular secretion of morphine occurred. In the  presence of M3G (2000 ng/ml) and M6G (500 ng/ml) this Clur/GFR ratio was elevated  to 17.3 +/- 4.8 (p less than .001), which implicates an interaction between these  compounds at an active reabsorption transport system. The CLur/GFR ratio for M3G  at 2000 ng/ml was 0.90 +/- 0.04, indicating the possibility of a small component  of tubular reabsorption, and this ratio was not significantly altered in the  presence of morphine and M6G. M6G was reabsorbed, probably actively, to a greater  extent than M3G, with an initial CLur/GFR ratio of 0.67 +/- 0.04, which was not  affected when morphine and M3G were coadministered. These data demonstrate an  unusual phenomenon in that the glucuronide metabolites, which are larger and less  lipophilic than the parent drug morphine, undergo net tubular reabsorption. The  renal handling of morphine is a complex combination of glomerular filtration,  active tubular secretion, and possibly active reabsorption.","1991-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1087-1092","","6","19","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1687015","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Perfusion; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Biological Transport; Kidney Tubules/*metabolism; Kidney/metabolism/physiology; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Morphine Derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Morphine/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A medicolegal case is presented in which the causality of  morphine administration with death was in dispute and pharmacokinetic modeling  was applied to infer the administered dose.

To  investigate this hypothesis, steady-state concentrations of morphine, M6G and M3G  in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in 11 patients receiving  chronic morphine therapy (9 orally and 2 subcutaneously) for treatment of  cancer-related pain. All patients appeared to have morphine-resistant pain and  had elected to proceed to intrathecal bupivacaine or percutaneous cordotomy.  Morphine, M6G and M3G concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid  chromatography. The concentrations (median and range) for morphine, M6G and M3G  in serum were 193 (14-1086) nmol/l, 847 (210-4113) nmol/l and 4553 (1324-24035)  nmol/l, respectively, while in CSF concentrations of morphine, M6G and M3G were  200 (21-1461) nmol/l, 115 (30-427) nmol/l and 719 (249-3252) nmol/l,  respectively. Median molar ratios of M6G/morphine and M3G/morphine in serum were  3.79 and 22.1, respectively, while in CSF the same ratios were 0.42 and 2.39,  respectively. Median molar ratios of M3G/M6G in serum and CSF were 5.84 and 6.61,  respectively. The median molar ratios for CSF/serum distribution of morphine, M6G  and M3G were 1.23, 0.12 and 0.14, respectively. Thus, despite their relatively  poor ability to penetrate into the CSF, the high serum concentrations of M6G and  M3G resulted in substantial concentrations of these metabolites in the CSF.  Nevertheless, M3G/M6G ratios in our morphine-resistant patients were similar to  published values in patients with well-controlled pain, suggesting that the  hypothesis that M3G plays a major role in morphine-resistance is not correct.","1994-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","145-149","","2","56","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8008404","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Resistance; Neoplasms/complications; Morphine Derivatives/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics; Pain/drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the respective contribution of the  gastrointestinal tract and the liver to the formation of the analgetically highly  potent morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) and the inactive morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G)  is still debated. In this study, morphine uptake and biotransformation to M3G and  M6G were compared in isolated cells from stomach, intestine, colon, and liver of  the guinea pig. Morphine was taken up by all cell types in a time-dependent  manner. There was evidence for a carrier-mediated accumulation in liver cells,  but not in the other cell types. Morphine was glucuronidated to M3G by gastric,  intestinal, colonic, and liver cells, and to M6G by all cell types excepted  gastric cells. The M3G/M6G ratio averaged 3.5, 4.7, and 5.4 for colonic,  intestinal, and liver cells, respectively. At low (1 microM) morphine  concentration, glucuronidation rates for M3G and M6G in intestinal cells (88 and  20 pmol x mg protein-1 x hr-1, respectively) were similar to those in liver cells  (133 and 12 pmol x mg protein-1 x hr-1, respectively). At high concentration (100  microM), rates of M3G and M6G formation in liver cells exceeded by 5- to 10-fold  those of intestinal or colonic cells. In conclusion, the epithelium of the small  and large intestine contributes with the liver to the formation of the active  M6G; at the same time, the gastric, intestinal, and colonic epithelia are  involved in the inactivation of morphine to M3G.","1993-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","13-17","","1","21","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8095206","","","","Male; Animals; Biotransformation; Biological Transport; Guinea Pigs; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Liver/cytology/*metabolism; Gastric Mucosa/metabolism; Glucuronates/metabolism; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium/metabolism; Intestines/cytology; Morphine Derivatives/*metabolism; Morphine/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Colon/cytology/metabolism; Digestive System/cytology/*metabolism; Stomach/cytology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parenteral chloramphenicol was given acutely (3-h studies) or  chronically (48-h studies). Morphine was administered by the i.v. or i.c.v.  route. Control rats received chloramphenicol and/or vehicle. Antinociception was  quantified using the hotplate latency test. Coadministration of chloramphenicol  with i.v. but not i.cv. morphine increased the extent and duration of morphine  antinociception by approximately 5.5-fold relative to rats that received i.v.  morphine alone. Thus, the mechanism through which chloramphenicol enhances i.v.  morphine antinociception in the rat does not directly involve supraspinal opioid  receptors. Acutely, parenteral coadministration of chloramphenicol and morphine  resulted in an approximately 75% increase in the mean area under the serum  morphine concentration-time curve but for chronic dosing there was no significant  change in this curve, indicating that factors other than morphine concentrations  contribute significantly to antinociception. Antinociceptive tolerance to  morphine developed more slowly in rats coadministered chloramphenicol, consistent  with our proposal that in vivo inhibition of M3G formation would result in  increased antinociception and delayed development of tolerance. However, our data  also indicate that chloramphenicol inhibited the biliary secretion of M3G.  Whether chloramphenicol altered the passage of M3G and morphine across the  blood-brain barrier remains to be investigated.","2000-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","236-244","","2","28","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10640523","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drug Synergism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Injections, Intravenous; Indicators and Reagents; Drug Tolerance; Infusions, Parenteral; Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Glucuronides/metabolism; Injections, Intraventricular; Jugular Veins; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Femoral Artery; Morphine Derivatives/blood; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Chloramphenicol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Groups of adult intact male, castrated male, female, and  testosterone-pretreated female Sprague-Dawley rats received prolonged (48 h)  infusions of i.v. morphine (5 or 10 mg/day) plus intra-arterial (i.a.) saline or  i.v. morphine (5 mg/day) plus i.a. chloramphenicol (300 mg/day). Antinociception  was quantified using the hotplate test. Serum concentrations of morphine and  morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) were assayed using high performance liquid  chromatography with electrochemical detection, whereas the serum testosterone  concentrations were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.  Consistent with our previous findings in intact male rats, prolonged coinfusion  of chloramphenicol with morphine produced a marked increase in the extent and  duration of morphine antinociception in all experimental groups. Additionally,  female and castrated male rats developed tolerance more slowly than either intact  male or testosterone-pretreated female rats, when coinfused with parenteral  morphine plus chloramphenicol. However, mean levels of antinociception were not  significantly correlated with either the mean serum morphine or M3G  concentrations, but were significantly inversely correlated with the mean values  of the M3G/morphine serum molar concentration ratio. Testosterone pretreatment of  female rats for 1 week before chronic morphine infusion abolished antinociception  and markedly reduced both the serum morphine and M3G concentrations. These latter  findings imply that testosterone modulates antinociception evoked by prolonged  morphine infusion in rats via a mechanism that appears to involve modulation of  morphine metabolism.","2001-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","446-457","","1","297","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11259573","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Infusions, Intravenous; Sex Characteristics; Creatinine/blood; Drug Tolerance; Behavior, Animal/drug effects; Chloramphenicol/pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/blood; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Testosterone/blood/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neither the morphine concentration nor its  decline correlated with the density of opiate receptors. Naloxone decreased the  morphine concentration in some CNS regions and plasma after a high dose of  morphine, but not after a small dose of morphine. The CNS regions in which  naloxone decreased the morphine concentration did not correlate with the density  of opiate receptors, and the concentration ratios (CNS regions versus plasma) of  morphine were not affected by naloxone. These results suggested that the morphine  concentration in the CNS did not reflect the in vivo binding of morphine and that  the naloxone-induced decrease in morphine concentration was not due to a  displacement of morphine from its receptor sites but due to a change in morphine  kinetics. Pharmacokinetic studies suggested that naloxone decreased the morphine  concentration through an increased volume of morphine distribution. This  naloxone-induced decrease in morphine concentration may contribute to the  naloxone-induced inhibition of morphine action in addition to the competitive  antagonism at opiate receptors.","1993-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","235-240","","2","63","","Jpn J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 8283834","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Injections, Subcutaneous; Tissue Distribution/drug effects; Central Nervous System/drug effects/*metabolism; Morphine/administration & dosage/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Naloxone/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Equi-analgesic doses of  dextromoramide, phenoperidine and Fentanyl are less than those of morphine,  whilst those of pethidine and pentazocine are higher. Study of the  pharmacokinetics of these various substances indicates no common elements, and it  is difficult to consider that the analgesic action is proportional to blood  levels. Clinical assessment of the mean duration of action makes it possible to  divide morphine derivatives into substances with a very short action (20 to 45  minutes) such as Febtanyl and phenoperidine, and those with a longer action (1 to  4 hours) which includes the majority of the other substances.

Both metabolites are formed in the liver, and their  greater polarity relative to the parent aglycone may limit their permeability  across hepatic membranes. This study compared the disposition of  hepatically-generated M3G and M6G in perfused livers isolated from guinea pigs.  METHODS: Livers were perfused at 30 ml/min in a non-recirculating manner with  Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing morphine (6 to 7 microM). Perfusing medium,  venous perfusate and bile were collected at regular intervals and concentrations  of morphine, M3G and M6G determined by reversed-phase HPLC. RESULTS:  Concentrations of morphine, M3G and M6G in perfusate and the rates of biliary  excretion of M3G and M6G were consistent between 20 and 50 min of perfusion. The  mean (+/-s.d.) ratio for the rate of formation of M3G relative to M6G was 3.7 +/-  1.5. A mean 33 +/- 3% of morphine extracted by the liver was recovered as summed  M3G and M6G. Of the M3G and M6G formed during a single passage, 19 +/- 11% and 9  +/- 9%, respectively, was excreted into bile; the values were significantly  different (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A greater fraction of hepatically-generated  M3G excreted into bile compared to that for M6G reflects differences in their  relative transport across sinusoidal and canalicular membranes of hepatocytes,  possibly via carrier-mediated systems.","1997-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1014-1018","","8","14","","Pharm Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9279882","","","","Male; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Perfusion; Liver/*metabolism; Guinea Pigs; Bile/metabolism; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine Derivatives/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Confirmation and quantitation  of morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine were performed by gas  chromatography/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, respectively. Blood  levels of free and total morphine were very site-dependent with ranges of  462-1350 and 534-1570 ng/mL, respectively. Large amounts of total morphine, 5220,  4200, and 2270 ng/g, had accumulated in the stomach contents, liver, and lung,  respectively. The concentration of free morphine in the cerebrospinal fluid was  correlated very closely with that in the cerebrum. The proportion of free  morphine in various fluids and tissues ranged from 23.0% to 98.8% of total  morphine: less than 30% in the stomach contents and urine; 30-60% in the liver,  cerebrospinal fluid, lung, and pericardial sac fluid; 61-90% in the spleen, right  femoral muscle, myocardium, blood in the left and right ventricles of the heart,  and right femoral vein blood; more than 91% in the right kidney and cerebrum.  Detectable amounts of 6-monoacetylmorphine, 417 ng/mL and 78 ng/g, existed in the  urine and stomach contents, respectively, indicating that this individual might  have died within several hours after heroin injection. Methamphetamine  concentrations in the blood were also site-dependent within the range 551-1730  ng/mL. In an in vitro experiment, free and conjugated morphine were stable in the  blood and urine at 4, 18-22, and 37 degrees C for a 10-day study period. In the  liver, however, conjugated morphine had been converted almost completely to free  morphine at 18-22 and 37 degrees C by the end of the experiment, although it was  stable at 4 degrees C. Urine 6-monoacetylmorphine, although degraded slightly at  37 degrees C, was stable at 4 and 18-22 degrees C during the experiment. Thus it  appears that non-specific hydrolysis of conjugated morphine to free morphine  would not occur in corpses at least for a few days after death. Femoral muscle  may be a specimen of choice for roughly predicting the ratio of free to total  morphine in blood even when blood specimens are not available, because the  femoral muscle is relatively spared of both postmortem diffusion of drugs and  bacterial invasion.","1997-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","736-740","","4","42","","J Forensic Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9243843","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Tissue Distribution; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Drug Stability; Drug Overdose; Body Fluids/*chemistry; *Postmortem Changes; Methamphetamine/chemistry; Morphine Derivatives/chemistry; Morphine/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphine 6-glucuronide is the main analgesic  metabolite of morphine and its presence in cerebro-spinal fluid could be due to a  metabolism of morphine in the central nervous system. Our animal studies showed  that the analgesic activity of morphine 6-glucuronide was 27 to 67 times higher  than that of morphine.

When we compared the morphine-6 concentrations in human cerebro-spinal  fluid with the analgesic potency of this metabolite, the morphine-6 glucuronide  was responsible of 33% to 67% of the supra-spinal analgesic effect.

Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, was given i.v. and the breathing pattern  improved. But drowsiness continued for another 48 hours and only regressed after  repeated doses of naloxone. CONCLUSIONS: Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), formed  from morphine in the liver, accumulates in blood and penetrates the blood-brain  barrier, binding with strong affinity to opiate receptors and exerts a strong  analgesic effect. As M6G is excreted by the kidney, its concentration rises in  renal failure and can lead to severe intoxication.

Treatment of rats  with lincomycin (500 mg/1 in drinking water and 25 mg twice a day by gastric  intubation for 4 days) significantly decreased cecal hydrolysis of the conjugate  and the cecal absorption of radioactive material. Lincomycin treatment also  increased fecal excretion of the conjugate in rats given morphine s.c. (5 mg/kg).  These findings indicated that hydrolysis of morphine glucuronide is dependent  upon the status of enteric bacteria and is a prerequisite to the enterohepatic  circulation of morphine. In addition, after lincomycin treatment, a greater  percentage of radioactivity excreted in the urine was associated with free  morphine. This finding could be expained by the demonstration of pH dependence of  renal excretion of morphine and a first-pass effect for this drug.","1975-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","303-310","","2","195","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1185599","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Intestinal Absorption; Intubation, Gastrointestinal; Liver/metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Injections, Subcutaneous; Bile/metabolism; Feces/analysis; Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/*metabolism/urine; *Enterohepatic Circulation/drug effects; Lincomycin/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans morphine is metabolised to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) which possess no opioid activity, and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) which is a potent  opioid receptor agonist that probably contribute to the desired as well as toxic  effects of morphine. 2. In order to investigate the possible effect of ranitidine  on morphine glucuronidation indicated by clinical studies and later confirmed in  vitro, a double blind cross-over study on eight human volunteers administered  oral morphine plus ranitidine or placebo was conducted. 3. Urine was collected in  fractions for 24 h. Serum and urine samples were prepared by solid phase  extraction and morphine, M3G and M6G were quantified by HPLC. 4. Ranitidine  significantly reduced the individual serum M3G/M6G ratio, and tended to increase  the serum AUC(0-90) of morphine. In contrast, ranitidine had no significant  effect on the urinary M3G/M6G ratio. The urinary recovery of morphine or morphine  glucuronides was unaffected by ranitidine. 5 Possible explanations to the  apparent incongruity between the serum and urine data are discussed.","1998-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","347-352","","6","17","","Hum Exp Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9688360","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Cross-Over Studies; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Histamine H2 Antagonists/*pharmacology; Glucuronates/*metabolism; Ranitidine/*pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/*metabolism; Morphine Derivatives/*metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autolytic processes  cause disintegration and increasing permeability of the physiological and  anatomical barriers such as vascular walls and lead to changes in substance  concentrations. In the present study, the experimental design represents an in  vitro postmortem simulation of a drug substance crossing a venous wall. The  postmortem behavior of morphine, morphine-3- and morphine-6-glucuronide was  investigated. A Chien-Valia-diffusion chamber with a patch of inferior vena cava  as diffusion barrier was used. For optimal simulation of postmortem events, vein  sampling was restricted to selected autopsy cases. Parameters for the analysis of  diffusion across the vascular tissue were dependence on time, temperature, and  initial substance concentrations. The penetration behavior simulating venous  efflux and influx of the substances was studied by different orientation of the  venous wall in the experiments. Rhodamine B was used as a model substance to  visualize the binding to the tissue and the passage across the venous wall. The  permeation of morphine, morphine-3- and morphine-6-glucuronide across a vein  tissue was found to be mainly dependent on the disintegration of the vascular  wall and on the postmortem time period as well as on concentration gradients.  From the data of this preliminary in vitro study, it can be concluded that a lag  time for transvascular diffusion exists postmortem. However, it could be  demonstrated, that adsorption to and penetration into the vascular tissue may  alter intraluminal blood concentrations even at an early stage of the postmortem  time period.","1997-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","486-491","","3","42","","J Forensic Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9144936","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fluorescent Dyes; Biological Transport; Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Diffusion Chambers, Culture; Morphine Derivatives/*pharmacokinetics; *Postmortem Changes; Rhodamines; Vena Cava, Inferior/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the absence of MAM or after consumption  of several opiates, the relative ratios of morphine, codeine and eventually  ethylmorphine must be known in order to determine which opiate(s) was (were)  taken. A total amount of opiates of less than 0.3 mg/l very often precludes any  characterization of the ingested drug(s). Here we have to point out that forensic  opiate testing should be done carefully.

CR oxycodone and  morphine were administered to 45 adult patients with stable pain for 3-6 days  after open-label titration in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial.  Twenty patients were evaluable. Both opioids provided adequate analgesia. The  variation in plasma morphine concentrations was higher than that of oxycodone,  consistent with the lower bioavailability of morphine. Liver dysfunction affected  selectively either oxycodone or morphine metabolism. Three patients with markedly  aberrant plasma opioid concentrations are presented. Significant individual  variation in morphine and oxycodone metabolism may account for abnormal responses  during treatment of chronic cancer pain.","2000","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","941-947","","8","39","","Acta Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11207001","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Cross-Over Studies; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/metabolism; Debrisoquin/metabolism; Delayed-Action Preparations; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Morphinans/blood; Oxycodone/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Morphine Derivatives/blood; Analgesics, Opioid/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Morphine/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Neoplasms/blood/complications/*metabolism; Pain/*drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the suggested formulation, two  other formulations (F2 and F3) were prepared: one for modified and another for  immediate drug release. The powders were characterized as bulk and tapped  density, Hausner's factor, and compressibility index analyses. Mini-tablets were  directly compressed and characterized by hardness, friability, size, and weight  variation. The in vitro drug release profile was carried out according to  apparatus 1 of USP. Formulations showed good flow properties, and the  mini-tablets displayed characteristics according to the specified. In comparison  to F3 (immediate release), F1 and F2 displayed slower drug release time, showing  the efficiency of the matrix formed. F3 displayed 90% of drug released up to  10 min, while F1 and F2 required 240 min. The results highlight the importance to  use intelligent formulation design for the development of improved mini-tablet  matrices.

Laboratory studies have shown  that pyrolysates of opium and particularly of morphine, a major opium alkaloid,  are highly mutagenic in bacteria and induce sister-chromatid exchanges in  mammalian cells after metabolic activation. We now report the ability of these  pyrolysates to transform Syrian hamster embryo cells in culture and present some  evidence for their carcinogenicity in mice and hamsters following topical,  subcutaneous, intratracheal and intragastric administration. 6 of the most  abundant mutagenic compounds present in morphine pyrolysate were isolated and  purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by gas  chromatography/mass spectrometry and 1H-Fourier transform nuclear magnetic  resonance spectroscopy. These hitherto unknown compounds, all containing a  hydroxy-phenanthrene moiety, were identified as:  3-methyl-3H-naphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol;  1,2-dihydro-3-methyl-3H-naphth[1,2-e]indol-10-ol; 6-methylaminophenanthren-3-ol;  2-methylphenanthro[3,4-d] [1,3]oxazol-10-ol;  2,3-dimethyl-3H-phenanthro[3,4-d]imidazol-10-ol and  2-methyl-3H-phenanthro[3,4-d]imidazol-10-ol. Mutagenicity in Salmonella  typhimurium TA98 of these compounds increased in the order listed, the last  compound being 35 times more active than benzo[a]pyrene.

MOR was infused at a constant rate into the fetal vena cava  and plasma was sampled from the fetus and ewe. Amniotic fluid was also sampled in  one animal. M3G was produced in the fetal lamb and accumulated extensively in  fetal plasma and amniotic fluid. Seizure activity was observed in two fetal lambs  with extremely high plasma concentrations of M3G and MOR. The molar ratio of M3G  to MOR in fetal plasma was dependent upon the duration of infusion, reaching a  plateau of 60 at about 3 days, but appeared to be independent of the infusion  rate over the range studied, 3 to 30 mg hr-1. Maternal plasma MOR and M3G  concentrations were substantially less than corresponding fetal plasma  concentrations. Using the steady-state plasma concentration of M3G obtained from  infusion of MOR and the clearance of M3G derived from single injection of M3G to  fetal lambs, the fraction of MOR converted to M3G by the fetus was calculated to  be 0.63. Although MOR is conjugated to glucuronic acid in the fetal lamb and  excreted into the amniotic fluid it is not readily transferred across the  epitheliochorial placenta to the ewe because of restricted permeability.","1988-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","576-584","","2","247","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3183953","","","","Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Algorithms; Blood Proteins/metabolism; Sheep; Fetus/*metabolism; Morphine/metabolism; Morphine Derivatives/*pharmacokinetics; Amniotic Fluid/analysis; Fetal Blood/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine peripheral analgesic mechanisms, we developed a topical opioid paradigm  in which the tail was immersed in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution containing  various drugs. Alone, DMSO was inactive in the tail-flick assay in mice. DMSO  solutions containing morphine and peptides such as [D-Ala2,MePhe4,  Gly(ol)5]enkephalin (DAMGO) produced a potent, dose-dependent analgesia with the  radiant heat tail-flick assay. The actions of the drugs were local. Analgesia was  observed only in regions of the tail exposed to the solution and not in more  proximal unexposed portions of the tail. Immersion of the tail in a solution  containing either 125I-labeled morphine or 125I-labeled DAMGO revealed no  detectable uptake of radioactivity into the brain, spinal cord, or blood. In the  tail, radioactivity was limited only to the regions actually immersed in the  solutions. The topical drugs potentiated systemic agents, similar to the  previously established synergy between peripheral and central sites of action.  Local tolerance was rapidly produced by repeated daily exposure of the tail to  morphine. Topical morphine tolerance was effectively blocked by the  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist MK801 given either systemically or  topically but not intrathecally. The ability of a topical NMDA antagonist to  block local morphine tolerance suggests that peripheral NMDA receptors mediate  topical morphine tolerance. Morphine was cross-tolerant to DAMGO, but not to  morphine-6beta-glucuronide, implying different mechanisms of action. These  observations are significant in the design and use of opioids clinically.","1999-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","247-252","","1","290","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10381783","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Tissue Distribution; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*antagonists & inhibitors; Brain/metabolism; Pain Measurement; Mice, Inbred ICR; Dizocilpine Maleate/pharmacology; Drug Tolerance; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology; Administration, Topical; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Spinal Cord/metabolism; Enkephalins/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Tail/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty min  after i.c.v. injection, M6G was 47 and 360 times more potent than morphine in the  writhing and tail-flick tests, respectively. This difference was not due to  differences in affinity because M6G displayed lower apparent affinities (Ki) for  mu and kappa binding sites in vitro. After systemic injection, the two opiates  were equieffective, although M6G produced a 10-fold longer antinociceptive  effect. These differences with route of administration partially result from the  hydrophilic nature of M6G because its inflow into the brain compartment was at  least 10-fold lower than that of morphine, whereas the rate of elimination of the  parent molecule was 3 times greater. After chronic treatment, mice readily  develop tolerance and marked physical dependence to the antinociceptive effects  of M6G. In vivo binding studies showed that M6G exerts its antinociceptive effect  at low (less than 1%) fractional occupancy of [3H]diprenorphine-specific binding  sites. In contrast, morphine needs to occupy 9.5 (writhing) to 47 (tail-flick)  times more opioid binding sites to produce the same antinociceptive activity. M6G  thus appears to have greater pharmacological potency than morphine, which in  comparison possesses a low intrinsic efficacy.","1992-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","25-31","","1","262","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1320685","","","","Male; Animals; Administration, Oral; Mice; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Binding Sites; Brain/metabolism; Injections, Subcutaneous; *Analgesia; Injections, Intraventricular; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Enkephalins/metabolism; Receptors, Opioid/*drug effects/metabolism; Morphine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a previous study, M6G depressed respiration in the neonatal guinea pig, becoming  more potent with aging, a finding that is confirmed in the current study. After  s.c. injection, M6G is absorbed into plasma, crosses the blood-brain barrier and  is present in the central nervous system at the time of maximal M6G-induced  ventilatory depression. No hydrolysis of M6G to morphine is detected in either  plasma or brain tissue by high-performance liquid chromatography. About 30% more  M6G is in plasma in 3-day-old than in 7-day-old pups after drug administration (P  < .05). Mean brain concentrations of M6G are 12% higher on day 3 than day 7, but  the difference is not statistically significant. Brain-to-plasma ratios of M6G do  not differ after 5 or 15 mg/kg of M6G or with age (mean ratio = 0.037). Brain  drug concentration is a linear function of plasma drug levels (r2 = 0.84),  suggesting M6G crosses the blood brain barrier by diffusion. Differential  systemic absorption or central nervous system distribution of M6G cannot explain  enhanced respiratory depression with aging. Morphine-3-beta-D-glucuronide (M3G)  also crossed the blood-brain barrier, but is less permeable than M6G (mean  brain-to-plasma ratio = 0.022). Contrary to reports in the literature, M3G at a  dose of 75 mg/kg, does not stimulate respiration in this study.

METHODS: Under nitrous oxide, halothane, and oxygen endotracheal  anesthesia, the cisterna magna of New Zealand albino rabbits was cannulated for  cerebrospinal fluid sampling, and catheters were placed in the lumbar epidural  space. Through the epidural catheter, 200 pmol of 3H-morphine contained in 500  microliters of 1.3 mM (0.21 mg) morphine was injected. Arterial blood and  cisternal CSF were sampled at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after  injection. Animals were killed with intravenous pentobarbital at the end of 120  minutes (n = 3), 6 hours (n = 4), and 12 hours (n = 2). In each animal the brain,  spinal cord, spinal roots, liver, kidneys, and urinary bladder were removed.  RESULTS: The injection site over the cord was identified and all tissues were  immediately frozen at -70 degrees C. Two-mm thick cross-sections, were taken from  every centimeter of the spinal cord. Radioactivity in the series of sections was  determined by scintillation spectroscopy. At 2 hours, 4.2% +/- 1.1% of the  injected radioactivity was recovered, and at 6 hours 1.6% +/- 0.6% was recovered.  Radioactivity was concentrated mainly around the lumbar injection site, and it  decreased as the distance increased from the injection site and coincided with  elapsed time after the injection. CONCLUSION: Multiple linear regression analysis  of radioactive labels showed the significant effect of time, distance from the  injection site, and the time-distance interaction on the distribution of  3H-morphine in the spinal cord (p < 0.0001 for time and rostral and caudal  distance from the injection site; and p < 0.0001 for interaction between time and  distance.) A major portion of the injected radioactivity was recovered in the  urine and a small amount in other tissues and body fluid: bladder, liver, spinal  roots, kidney, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid.","1992-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","334-339","","6","17","","Reg Anesth","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1286055","","","","Animals; Tritium; Rabbits; Tissue Distribution; Consciousness; Analgesia, Epidural; Urinary Bladder/metabolism; Injections, Epidural; Morphine/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics; Spinal Cord/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the tail flick and hotplate latency tests are reported to quantify  antinociception mediated primarily by spinal and supraspinal mechanisms  respectively, these methods were used to determine the comparative ""apparent""  levels of antinociception (expressed as percentage maximum possible effect, %  MPE) achieved after M6G or morphine administration. Following i.v. or i.p. M6G  (1.9-5.4 micromol) dosing or i.p. morphine (10 micromol) dosing, high levels of  antinociception (>50% MPE) were achieved using the tail flick test whereas  base-line levels of antinociception were observed 30 sec later in the same rats  using the hotplate test. By contrast, antinociception evoked by i.v. morphine (10  micromol) exceeded 50% MPE using both the hotplate and tail flick tests although  the ""apparent"" potency was approximately 2.5 times greater using the tail flick  test. After i.c.v. dosing, M6G (0.22-3.3 nmol) was significantly (P < .05) more  potent when assessed using the tail flick compared with the hotplate test. Taken  together, these data strongly indicate that following central and systemic  administration, M6G's antinociceptive effects are mediated primarily by spinal  structures whereas both spinal and supraspinal mechanisms contribute to systemic  morphine's antinociceptive effects.","1998-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1326-1332","","3","286","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9732396","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Intravenous; Blood-Brain Barrier; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Reflex/drug effects; Morphine/administration & dosage; Injections, Intraventricular; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage; Morphine Derivatives/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, micro-type opioid receptors, responsible for analgesic effect  of endogenic and egzogenic opioids, were not found on majority of peripheral  neurons. They appear in skin or mucous membranes with active inflammatory or  neoplastic process due to intensive migration to peripheral nerve efferent  fibres. These discoveries made it possible to apply opioid analgesics topically  (ointments, hydrogels) on pathologically changed skin or mucous membranes. This  study presents the results of tests on two batches of hydrogel preparations  produced according to own prescription on the base of acrylic acid polymers  (Carbopol Ultrez 10 and Carbopol 980 NF). The polymer carboxyl groups were  neutralized with different bases: sodium hydroxide, potasium hydroxide,  triethanolamine, sodium tetraborate. The obtained hydrogel preparations were  subjected to rheological tests. Extensibility was determined by extensometric  method, whereas viscosity, yield stress and thixotropy were determined with the  use of cone-plate digital rheometer. The activity of hydrogels hydrogen ions (pH)  and the rate of their loss of volatile components at human body temperature were  also tested. Using modified Mutimer apparatus morphine hydrochloride (MCl)  diffusion was performed from the surface of the produced hydrogels through model  stratum corneum (Tomofan) to acceptor fluid (water). The quantity of the released  therapeutic agent in time function was determined by spectrophotometric method.  The carried out studies have demonstrated that the produced hydrogels are  non-Newtonian, viscoelastic, thixotropic systems of similar yield stress. The  obtained results do not allow to determine unequivocally the effect of MCl, the  kind of Carbopol and cross-linking base on hydrogel viscosity. The inversely  proportional dependence between hydrogel viscosity (eta) and theoretical  diffusion coefficient (D) of morphine hydrochloride was not observed, either. The  loss of volatile components (water) is more effective from hydrogels produced on  Carbopol Ultrez 10 base. The process of MCl diffusion is most effective from  hydrogel made on Carbopol Ultrez 10 base and neutralized with sodium hydroxide or  triethanolamine.","2009","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","25-37","","4","39","","Polim Med","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 20099733","","","","Biological Availability; Rheology; Drug Carriers/*chemistry; Acrylic Resins; Polyvinyls/*chemistry; Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry; Hydrogels/*chemistry; Morphine/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The possibility of PM redistribution of the opioid drug has not been studied  previously. We treated adult Wistar rats with 4 mg/kg of morphine i.m. and  measured cardiac cavity levels at the time of death, by killing (2 h postdose) 24  and 96 h PM. Morphine concentrations rose from 41.4 +/- 13.2 ng/ml at death to  111.9 +/- 66.6 ng/ml at 24 h (p = 0.00036), with no additional increase at 96 h  (98.7 +/- 21.7 ng/ml). After death there was accumulation of endogenous  substances cross-reacting with the morphine radioimmunoassay.

The antinociceptive action of these  agents seems to be independent of beneficial effect on depression or mood. Among  antidepressant drugs, those of the tricyclic class are preferred when an  analgesic effect is sought. Their primary application is for pain due to nerve  injury, so-called ""neuropathic pain"". Although the co-administration of tricyclic  antidepressants may increase plasma morphine concentrations, any potentiation of  morphine analgesia is thought not to be due to an increased bioavailability of  the opiate, but to an intrinsic analgesic effect of antidepressants. On this  basis, the use of antidepressants in combination with opioids for the treatment  of cancer pain is suitable when a component of deafferentation is present or when  there is concomitant depressive illness.","1991","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","42-44","","4","7","","J Palliat Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1783964","","","","Humans; Drug Synergism; Biological Availability; Drug Therapy, Combination; Pain/*drug therapy/etiology; Neoplasms/*physiopathology; Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first part of the study,  the morphine pharmacokinetic profile of each dog was analyzed and used to develop  the parameters of a model tailored to that particular dog. In the second part,  this tailored model was implemented to test whether the infusion device was able  to achieve the desired concentration profile. RESULTS: The computer-controlled  infusion device was able to achieve all the desired plasma concentrations.

The combinations of intrathecal (i.t.) and intracerebroventricular  (i.v.t.) dosages used were selected to yield particular ratios of supraspinal to  spinal (SS:S) agonisms. Dose-response lines for both the tail-flick and hot plate  responses were constructed for each SS:S ratio, with the abscissa representing  i.v.t. morphine dosage. It was observed that the analgetic potency of morphine  injected i.v.t. was profoundly potentiated by the concurrent administration of  morphine i.t. Dose-response lines for i.v.t. morphine were shifted progressively  to the left as the spinal dose of morphine was increased. At the optimal balance  of spinal and supraspinal dosage (SS:S = 1:1), the ED50 values for i.v.t.  morphine for the hot plate and tail-flick tests were reduced by factors of 45 and  29, respectively. A similar, but less profound, potentiation of the analgetic  potency of morphine injected i.t. by concurrent administration of morphine i.v.t.  was observed. Isobolographic analysis of the data revealed that the isobols were  hyperbolas having extreme negative curvature of all effect levels. Inspection of  the isobols indicated that, at all ratios of spinal to supraspinal agonism which  could conceivably be obtained when morphine is given systemically, the  spinal-supraspinal interaction is multiplicative. The results suggest that  narcotic agonism at both spinal and supraspinal narcotic-sensitive sites is  essential to the production of analgesia by systemically administered morphine  and that neither site can logically be deemed the ""primary"" site of narcotic  action.","1980-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","633-642","","3","215","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6893721","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Binding Sites; Tissue Distribution; Brain/*drug effects/metabolism; Injections, Spinal; Nociceptors/*drug effects; Injections, Intraventricular; Spinal Cord/*drug effects/metabolism; Morphine/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose the opioids methadone  and buprenorphine have been evaluated and are used nowadays in many countries.  However, since 1998 also the use of slow-release oral morphine (SROM) has been  legally permitted in Austria. Our data show that these morphine preparations are  frequently abused and are dominating the black market in the meantime. Especially  the intravenous consumption of SROM goes along with highly dangerous side effects  that exceed the risks of needle sharing alone. Special galenics are supposed to  ensure a 24 h effect of the otherwise quickly metabolised morphine. If dissolved  and injected, insoluble contents such as talcum cause microembolisms, leading to  severe damages of the inner organs. Furthermore, SROM, i.e. a drug prescribed by  physicians, has been proved to be the main responsible substance in most drug  related deaths since its permission and has nearly replaced heroin. Forensic  physicians play a major role in the profound examination of these cases,  including extensive toxicological analyses and interpretation of results. For  instance, a differentiation between a recent morphine and heroin consumption is  certainly possible, provided appropriate methods are used. A reliable estimation  of the current situation of drug abusing habits is a premise for adequate  therapeutic offers and preventive measures. Thus, well-founded and comparable  data have to be collected. To facilitate data report a standardized report form  has been developed that includes an obligatory statement regarding morphine or  heroin consumption. This should help to enlighten the ongoing discussion on the  role of SRM in drug abuse cases. Our results indicate that the prescription of  SROM in opiate maintenance therapy has to be handled very strictly and should be  reserved for special patients only. A slackening of the Austrian law concerning  SROM is therefore objected.","2010","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","108-117","","2","24","","Neuropsychiatr","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 20605006","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Brain/pathology; Delayed-Action Preparations; Cause of Death; Austria; Lung/pathology; Myocardium/pathology; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Substance Abuse Detection/methods; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Drug Overdose/mortality/pathology; Foreign-Body Reaction/pathology; Heroin Dependence/*mortality/pathology/*rehabilitation; Microscopy, Polarization; Morphine Dependence/*mortality/pathology/rehabilitation; Narcotics/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Pulmonary Embolism/pathology; Substance Abuse, Intravenous/*mortality/pathology/rehabilitation; Talc/toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A tail flick assay was used to evaluate the antinociceptive activity.  The kinetics of morphine were evaluated in blood and brain, using tritiated  morphine as tracer. RESULTS: These nanoparticles were shown to increase the  duration of the antinociceptive activity of morphine after nasal administration.  This effect was not due to an increase of morphine in the blood; and the  analgesic activity of morphine in association with nanoparticles was reversed by  naloxone. The ED50 value was 33.6+/-15.6 mg/kg for morphine alone and 14.4+/-7.6  mg/kg in presence of nanoparticles. They were only effective at low doses (1.5 to  2.5 microg), a higher or a lower dose had no effect. No interaction was found  between nanoparticles and morphine. NaDOC, a permeation enhancer, was unable to  improve nasal morphine activity.

Analgesic duration was determined using the tail-flick test after intrathecal  injection of 12.5, 25, or 50 micrograms of plain or liposomal morphine (n = 6  mice/dose/formulation). Toxicity of the formulations was compared by estimating  LD50. Neuraxial morphine distribution was determined after 20 micrograms of plain  or liposomal morphine. The excised spinal cord and brain were divided into five  segments at 1 min, and at 1, 4, and 8 h after injection for both formulations. In  addition, for the liposomal morphine, similar sections were obtained at 24 h (n =  6 mice/formulation/time point). Segmental morphine concentration was quantified  using radioimmunoassay. Liposomal encapsulation significantly prolonged duration  of analgesia for the 25-micrograms (13.4 +/- 1.64 [SE] vs 4.1 +/- 0.5 h) and  50-micrograms doses (16.8 +/- 4.0 vs 4.6 +/- 1.0 h). The estimated LD50 was 200  (confidence interval 151-257 micrograms) for plain morphine, but was not  determinable for the liposomal formulation, since no deaths occurred at the  largest dose level which could be tested (371 micrograms). For plain morphine,  the drug was not confined to a specific neuraxial segment, and segmental levels  declined rapidly. After liposomal morphine, the most morphine was concentrated  and persisted in the low spinal cord segment at each time interval. These results  show that a single dose of liposomal morphine produces prolonged analgesia with  decreased toxicity compared to the plain formulation.","1995-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","514-518","","3","81","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7653814","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Lethal Dose 50; Injections, Intravenous; Tissue Distribution; Brain Chemistry; Brain/metabolism; Drug Carriers; Liposomes; Morphine/*administration & dosage/metabolism/toxicity; Spinal Cord/chemistry/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the new circuit, drugs were eliminated as follows: vancomycin 36%,  gentamicin 10%, phenobarbital 17%, phenytoin 43%, morphine 36%. In the used  system, levels fell to a much smaller extent: vancomycin 11%, phenobarbital 6%,  gentamicin 0%, phenytoin 0%, and morphine 16%. In a child receiving 20  micrograms/kg/h infusion of morphine, steady-state concentrations of 68.2 ng/ml  fell to 11.6 ng/ml after changing the membrane. Our data indicate that the ECMO  is associated with lowering of the concentrations of commonly used medications  and that this process may depend partially on how new the membrane is. Before  these changes may lead to new dosing guidelines for small children receiving  ECMO, more experiments with new and used systems are warranted, as well as with  different types of ECMO.","1993-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","263-266","","4","15","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8236359","","","","Humans; Infant, Newborn; *Pharmacokinetics; Anticonvulsants/pharmacokinetics; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacokinetics; Critical Care; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*adverse effects; Morphine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

S.","A new physiologically based, segregated-flow model to explain route-dependent intestinal metabolism.","Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals","","0090-9556","","","Processes of intestinal absorption, metabolism, and secretion must be considered simultaneously in viewing oral drug bioavailability. Existing models often fail  to predict route-dependent intestinal metabolism, namely, little metabolism  occurs after systemic dosing but notable metabolism exists after oral dosing. A  physiologically based, Segregated-Flow Model (SFM) was developed to examine the  influence of intestinal transport (absorption and exsorption), metabolism, flow,  tissue-partitioning characteristics, and elimination in other organs on  intestinal clearance, intestinal availability, and systemic bioavailability. For  the SFM, blood flow to intestine was effectively segregated for the perfusion of  two regions, with 10% reaching an absorptive layer-the enterocytes at the villus  tips of the mucosa where metabolic enzymes and the P-glycoprotein reside, and the  remaining 90% supplying the rest of the intestine (serosa and submucosa), a  nonabsorptive layer. The traditional, physiologically-based model, which regards  the intestine as a single, homogeneous compartment with all of the intestinal  blood flow perfusing the tissue, was also examined for comparison. The analytical  solutions under first order conditions were essentially identical for the SFM and  traditional model, differing only in the flow rate to the absorptive/removal  region. The presence of other elimination organs did not affect the intestinal  clearance and bioavailability estimates, but reduced the percentage of dose  metabolized by the intestine. For both models, intestinal availability was  inversely related to the intrinsic clearances for intestinal metabolism and  exsorption, and was additionally affected by both the rate constant for  absorption and that denoting luminal loss when drug was exsorbed. However, the  effect of secretion by P-glycoprotein became attenuated with rapid absorption.  The difference in flow between models imparted a substantial influence on the  intestinal clearance of flow-limited substrates, and the SFM predicted markedly  higher extents of intestinal metabolism for oral over i.v. dosing. Thus, the SFM  provides a physiological view of the intestine and explains the observation of  route-dependent, intestinal metabolism.","2000-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","224-235","","2","28","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10640522","","","","Administration, Oral; Models, Biological; Area Under Curve; Injections, Intravenous; Intestinal Absorption; Computer Simulation; Algorithms; *Pharmacokinetics; Enterocytes/metabolism; Regional Blood Flow/physiology; Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Intestines/blood supply; Narcotics/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M-6-G binds to the  opioid receptor and has analgesic properties in man. Clinical studies have not  delivered strong evidence of significant correlation between the concentration of  morphine and its glucuronides in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and  pharmacodynamics such as analgesia. There is no clinical evidence to indicate  that M-6-G has a pronounced respiratory depressing effect in man, while the  literature contains conflicting reports with regard to other side-effects. M-3-G  does not bind to the m-opioid receptor and consequently has no antinociceptive  effects. Studies in rodents have shown that morphine, M-6-G and especially M-3-G  may induce hyperalgesia, allodynia and myoclonus. It is assumed that these side  effects are caused by a spinal antiglycinergic mechanism. The role of M-3-G in  morphine antagonism and development of tolerance has not yet been settled. As  M-3-G and M-6-G are eliminated by the kidneys, renal insufficiency will lead to  accumulation of these. Accordingly dosage should be reduced or other opioids be  considered in such cases.","1997-05-26","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","3383-3386","","22","159","","Ugeskr Laeger","","","","","","","","dan","","","","","","","Place: Denmark PMID: 9199024","","","","Humans; Receptors, Opioid, mu/metabolism; Morphine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In ten volunteers, 4 mg of epidural morphine were  injected at the T4 level, and ten volunteers received thoracic epidural analgesia  with 0.5% bupivacaine, the latter causing block of the sympathetic innervation to  the stomach. Acetaminophen absorption was used as an indirect measure of the rate  of gastric emptying. After establishment of the analgesia with bupivacaine, or  160 (110-185) minutes after the administration of epidural morphine, 1.5 g  acetaminophen dissolved in water was ingested. Serum samples were taken at  15-minute intervals for 2 hours and serum acetaminophen concentrations were  determined by an immunologic method. Control acetaminophen absorption studies  without thoracic epidural analgesia were performed in all 20 subjects on another  occasion. During epidural analgesia with morphine mean serum acetaminophen  concentrations were lower (P less than 0.05), the maximum serum acetaminophen  concentration was lower (P less than 0.01), the time taken to reach the maximum  concentration was longer (P less than 0.02), and the area under the concentration  time curve from 0 to 60 minutes was smaller (P less than 0.01) than in the  control study. The corresponding values during epidural analgesia with  bupivacaine did not differ from the control values. Four subjects with extremely  delayed gastric emptying during epidural analgesia with morphine showed no delay  in gastric emptying after receiving 4 mg morphine intramuscularly. Serum morphine  concentrations were lower after epidural than after intramuscular morphine. In  summary, 4 mg epidural morphine delayed gastric emptying. This was not a systemic  effect of morphine. Thoracic epidural analgesia with bupivacaine had no influence  on gastric emptying.","1988-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","687-694","","7","67","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3382043","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Time Factors; Absorption; Injections, Intramuscular; Acetaminophen/blood; *Anesthesia, Epidural; Gastric Emptying/*drug effects; Morphine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology; Bupivacaine/*pharmacology; Thoracic Vertebrae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heroin prescription is possible in some countries for  chronic, treatment-refractory opioid-dependent patients and as a potent analgesic  for specific indications. We aimed to study the pharmacokinetic interactions of  heroin and its main pharmacodynamically active metabolites, 6-monoacetylmorphine  (6-MAM) and morphine, with the multidrug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein/ABCB1  and BCRP/ABCG2 using wild-type, Abcb1a/1b and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 knockout mice.  METHODS & RESULTS: Upon subcutaneous (s.c.) heroin administration, its blood  levels decreased quickly, making it challenging to detect heroin even shortly  after dosing. 6-MAM was the predominant active metabolite present in blood and  most tissues. At 10 and 30 min after heroin administration, 6-MAM and morphine  brain accumulation were increased about 2-fold when mouse (m)Abcb1a/1b and mAbcg2  were ablated. Fifteen minutes after direct s.c. administration of an equimolar  dose of 6-MAM, we observed good intrinsic brain penetration of 6-MAM in wild-type  mice. Still, mAbcb1 limited brain accumulation of 6-MAM and morphine without  affecting their blood exposure, and possibly mediated their direct intestinal  excretion. A minor contribution of mAbcg2 to these effects could not be excluded.  CONCLUSIONS: We show that mAbcb1a/1b can limit 6-MAM and morphine brain exposure.  Pharmacodynamic behavioral/postural observations, while non-quantitative,  supported moderately increased brain levels of 6-MAM and morphine in the knockout  mouse strains. Variation in ABCB1 activity due to genetic polymorphisms or  environmental factors (e.g., drug interactions) might affect 6-MAM/morphine  exposure in individuals, but only to a limited extent.","2023-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1885-1899","","8","40","","Pharm Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In contrast to urine, where HCOD is typically detected as a minor metabolite  of COD, HCOD was the most commonly detected metabolite in oral fluid in samples  testing positive for COD with reported prescriptions for COD.

It is not surprising that some viewpoints expressed tend to be often repeated  without critical analysis. The goal of this lecture is to probe some commonly  held viewpoints about the pharmacology of morphine. This involves retracing some  of its history, re-examining its physicochemical nature, re-evaluating its  physiologic disposition and the pharmacologic activity of its metabolites.  METHODS: The background material selected for inclusion consists of historic  pharmacologic secondary sources, selections from the recent primary literature on  morphine pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and vignettes from the author's  personal research in progress with colleagues in Australia. RESULTS: The author's  perspective is that of a chemical pharmacologist with more than a passing  interest in pharmacokinetics. The synthesis evaluates the therapeutic  consequences of the pharmacologic aspects chosen. CONCLUSIONS: Morphine in  various forms has been used successfully in the alleviation of pain for at least  several millenia but it is only relatively recently that a rationale for its  action has been found. Morphine is a relatively poorly lipophilic opioid but  equilibrates with tissue of the brain relatively easily. While the metabolism of  morphine occurs in the liver, it is metabolized in the kidneys and brain as well.  The clearance of morphine is not notably decreased by renal dysfunction, but  clearance of its glucuronide metabolites is decreased markedly. While the  metabolites produced may be shown to be pharmacologically active in particular  experimental preparations, it is not yet certain that they contribute  pharmacologically after systemic administration of morphine in experimental  animals or humans with generally normal physiology.","1995-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","263-282","","4","20","","Reg Anesth","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7577774","","","","Humans; Animals; Analgesics, Opioid/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Morphine/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In its  simplest form, this suggests the hypothesis that co-activation of spinal alpha2  and opioid receptors should be manifested as a synergistic interaction in which  in its simplest form the net effect would be a product of the effect produced by  either drug alone. To assess this hypothesis, rats were prepared with chronically  implanted intrathecal (IT) catheters. Dose-response curves for IT morphine were  obtained in the presence of fixed doses (0.01 nmol, 0.03 nmol, 0.1 nmol, 0.3  nmol) of 2-[2,6-dimethylphenylamino]-2-imidazoline (ST-91), an alpha 2 agonist.  Such concurrent administration of ST-91 resulted in highly significant leftward  shifts in the effect of morphine on the hot plate (52.5 degrees C) measure with a  significant increase in dose-response curve slopes. To minimize the effects of  the cut-off time necessary in an antinociceptive measure, a ""Cox proportional  hazard"" analysis was used. The (log) Hazard function log[h(t)] is expressed as a  linear function of the effects resulting from the action of morphine, the action  of ST-91 and as a function of an interaction of morphine and ST-91, e.g., the  general form is: log[h(t)] = alpha o(t) + beta 1.log doseM + beta 2.log doseST +  beta 12.log doseM.log doseST Estimates of the principal coefficients beta 1, beta  2 and beta 12 corresponding to the overall effect of morphine alone, ST-91 alone  and the interaction between the two were calculated: beta 1, beta 2 and beta 12.  A statistical test of the interaction coefficient revealed that beta 12 was  significantly (p less than .001) different from zero, indicating the powerful  synergy between IT ST-91 and morphine. Confirmation of the synergistic nature of  spinal opioid alpha 2 receptors was provided by the fact that IT injection of  naloxone (90 nmol) or phentolamine (100 nmol) after IT injection of various  combinations of morphine and ST-91 immediately and completely abolished the  potentiating effect of the combination. The clearance of IT [3H]morphine from the  thoracic and lumbar spinal cord was not changed in the presence of ST-91. These  observations suggest a potent synergistic interaction between spinal mu and alpha  2 adrenergic receptor systems.","1990-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","383-392","","2","254","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1974633","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Drug Synergism; Rats, Inbred Strains; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Pain/*drug therapy; Regression Analysis; Injections, Spinal; Reaction Time; Naloxone/pharmacology; Phentolamine/pharmacology; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use; Clonidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Morphine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Parasympathomimetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Addition of morphine  inhibited the depolarization-stimulated uptake of calcium without affecting  uptake under nondepolarizing conditions. This inhibition was prevented by  simultaneous addition of naloxone with morphine before calcium uptake was  initiated. Acute tolerance to morphine increased depolarization-stimulated  synaptosomal calcium uptake. On the other hand, chronic exposure of rats to  morphine to elicit tolerance to and physical dependence on morphine did not  influence synaptosomal calcium uptake. However, these preparations apparently  lost the ability of in vitro morphine-inhibition of calcium uptake into the  synaptosomes. Our results suggested that adaptive changes of synaptosomal calcium  uptake produced by exposure to morphine may be involved in tolerance and physical  dependence development, but influence of morphine on calcium uptake by the  synaptosomes isolated from the rats acutely tolerance to morphine was differed  from that of chronic tolerant rats.","1982-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","625-632","","4","32","","Jpn J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 7131949","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Absorption; Brain/*metabolism; Drug Tolerance; Calcium/*metabolism; Naloxone/pharmacology; Cell Fractionation; Synaptosomes/*metabolism; Morphine/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was  undertaken to determine whether proglumide enhances morphine analgesia for  patients experiencing postoperative pain. At onset of pain after the removal of  impacted third molars, patients (n = 60) received intravenously either 4 mg  morphine, 8 mg morphine, or 4 mg morphine plus proglumide (0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg).  The administration of 8 mg morphine significantly reduced pain, in comparison  with baseline and 4 mg morphine, for the first 30 minutes. The addition of 0.05  mg proglumide resulted in a significant increase in the magnitude and duration of  the analgesic activity of 4 mg morphine; 0.5 and 5.0 mg proglumide did not  produce this effect. No difference was seen in respiratory rate or in the  frequency of side effects among the various forms of treatment.

The objectives of the present experiment were to  characterize the rate and extent of tolerance development during the  administration of multiple increasing i.v. bolus doses of morphine to rats, and  to construct a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of morphine tolerance.  Morphine was administered according to two different treatment (TXT) regimens: a  12-hr TXT, in which a total morphine exposure of 24 mg/kg was administered in  seven escalating doses, and a 13-day TXT, in which escalating doses of morphine  were administered daily up to a maximum of 6 mg/kg. Analgesic effect, expressed  as the percent of maximum possible response, was assessed with the hot  water-induced tail flick. Serum samples were collected for determination of  morphine concentrations by HPLC. Concentration-normalized peak effects, measured  after each morphine dose, remained constant throughout the 12-hr study period,  which suggests that there was little or no tolerance development during the 12-hr  TXT. In contrast, tolerance appeared more significant during administration of  the 13-day TXT; a large decrease in normalized peak effect occurred between days  1 and 8. Effect remained constant thereafter, with administration of the maximum  dose of morphine for the remainder of the treatment period. A  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model describing the development of tolerance  during the 13-day TXT was constructed. The applicability of this model of  tolerance to morphine-induced antinociception with different modes of  administration is discussed.","1997-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","713-720","","2","281","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9152377","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Injections, Intravenous; Drug Tolerance; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was found that castration led to immediate (24 hr) increases in the  ADH-dependent metabolism of ethanol which persisted for at least 6 weeks  postcastration. Testosterone completely reversed the effects of castration.  Moreover, when increases in liver ADH activity and the metabolism of ethanol were  allowed to develop to maximal levels (2 weeks), a single s.c. injection of  testosterone promptly reversed the effects of castration, such that by 24 hr  castrated animals were indistinguishable from controls. Thus, it appears that in  the male Sprague-Dawley-derived rat liver ADH activity and the in vivo metabolism  of ethanol are under the control of testosterone. Because narcotics have also  been shown to depress serum testosterone levels, and there is good evidence of  significant pharmacological and biochemical interactions between the narcotics  and ethanol, we examined whether chronic administration of morphine led to  testosterone-reversible increases in the ADH-dependent metabolic disposition of  ethanol. We found that chronic morphine administration, at doses sufficient to  markedly depress serum testosterone levels (> 85%), produced large increases in  liver ADH activity and the clearance of ethanol. Concurrent administration of  testosterone completely abolished this effect. These data may, therefore, provide  the first evidence of a biochemical mechanism involved in the interactions  between morphine and ethanol. Furthermore, our results suggest that drug-induced  reductions in serum testosterone may serve as an important mechanism involved in  the cross-tolerance observed between ethanol and many abused, sedative-hypnotic  drugs which share the common ability to decrease serum testosterone.","1980-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","317-324","","2","215","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7003096","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects; Liver/*enzymology; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Pyrazoles/pharmacology; Ethanol/*metabolism; Testosterone/pharmacology; *Castration; Alcohol Oxidoreductases/*analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brain morphine concentration and tail-flick latency both increased with  increasing dosage over the first 3 days of the 6-day infusion regimen. There was  evidence of cellular tolerance within 24 to 48 hours after the beginning of  infusion, with marked tolerance by day 6. Between days 3 and 6 a dispositional  tolerance, evidenced by a dramatic fall in brain morphine concentration, also  became apparent. After discontinuation of the infusion, the brain morphine  dropped to extremely low levels by 24 hours, but significant tolerance to  antinociceptive effects remained for 72 hours. Estimation of morphine in plasma,  urine, peritoneal tissues and feces suggested several possible explanations for  the dispositional tolerance observed. These include increased conjugation of  morphine, increased fecal elimination and increased localization in muscle or  peritoneal tissues with chronic infusion at relatively high doses. The present  work thus examines the pharmacokinetics of morphine in the rat in a chronic  treatment model that is currently being used in a number of laboratories for the  rapid induction of drug tolerance and dependence.","1978-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","556-562","","3","205","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 660529","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Reaction Time/drug effects; Brain/metabolism; Drug Tolerance; Infusions, Parenteral; *Analgesics; Morphine/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To  determine if this supposition is true, the authors measured the rate at which  morphine, fentanyl, and lidocaine diffuse through dog and monkey meningeal  specimens with and without a root sleeve. Two meningeal specimens of intact  dura-arachnoid-pia mater were removed from each animal and placed in separate  temperature-controlled diffusion cells. One specimen included a spinal nerve root  sleeve; the other did not. The permeability of the tissues to each drug was then  determined by placing the study drug in one of the reservoirs of the diffusion  cell and measuring the rate at which the drug diffused through the tissue and  accumulated in the second reservoir. There was no difference in permeability  between specimens with and without a nerve root sleeve for any drug in either  species. Lidocaine was found to diffuse through the tissue significantly faster  than fentanyl in both the dog and monkey even though fentanyl is nearly 48 times  more lipid soluble than lidocaine. Morphine diffused through the tissue  significantly slower than both lidocaine and fentanyl. The authors conclude that  the spinal nerve root sleeve is not a preferred route of entry for drugs moving  from the epidural space to the spinal cord. In addition, despite hypotheses to  the contrary, lipid solubility does not appear to be the overriding determinant  of meningeal permeability.","1991-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","827-832","","5","75","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1952207","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Dogs; Tissue Distribution; Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects; Spinal Cord/*metabolism; Epidural Space; Macaca nemestrina; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Fentanyl/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Lidocaine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Meninges/*metabolism; Spinal Nerve Roots/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an extension of this work, we have carried out similar studies with  N-acetylcysteine in an attempt to obtain a product amenable to complete NMR  analysis and unambiguous structure assignment. Incubation of [3H]morphine and  N-acetylcysteine with microsomal preparations isolated from human and from  phenobarbital-treated rats led to the isolation by HPLC of a labeled species  displaying a fast atom bombardment mass spectrum consistent with the expected  N-acetylcysteinyl adduct of morphine. Data obtained from the high resolution  1H-NMR spectrum of the adduct and that of synthetic 10 alpha-hydroxycodeine  established the structure of the metabolite as 10  alpha-S-(N-acetylcysteinyl)morphine.

To  compare the hemodynamics, measurements were taken pre-operatively, after  induction of general anesthesia, during aortic dissection, aortic cross-clamping  and 3-5 minutes after the first revascularisation. Plasma and CSF drug levels  were measured at intervals in 6 patients in the EM end 5 patients in the ES  group. Both drugs provided satisfactory analgesia which persisted for 10.4 hours  in the EM and 6.3 hours in the ES group. The fall in systemic pressure and left  ventricular work in both groups after induction of general anesthesia suggests  that EM and ES must be used with caution in patients with hypovolemic or  cardiovascular disease. There was a significant difference in SVR between the two  groups during the aortic dissection, due to a rise in SBP in the ES group and a  tendency for SVR to fall in the EM group. However significant differences in left  ventricular work did not occur. Notable was the absence of significant changes in  filling pressure, CI and left ventricular function during aortic cross-clamping.  After revascularization a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure  occurred in association with an increase in heart rate in the EM group. The  influence of the plasma and CSF concentrations of morphine and sufentanil on the  hemodynamic changes during surgery were evaluated.","1989","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","65-77","","1","40","","Acta Anaesthesiol Belg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Belgium PMID: 2524949","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Analgesia, Epidural; Aorta, Abdominal/surgery; Sufentanil; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Aortic Diseases/*surgery; Adjuvants, Anesthesia/*administration & dosage; Arteriosclerosis/surgery; Fentanyl/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous factors associated with the vehicle and therapeutic  agent physiochemical properties affect the capability and rate of penetration of  a therapeutic substance in the form of a drug into dermis. Promotors of  transcutaneous absorption, which weaken the integrity of epidermal corneal layer  and thus, increase therapeutic substance penetration play more and more important  role. In this study non-ionic macromolecular surface active compounds from  Rokacets group were suggested as potential promotors of transdermal absorption  for morphine sulphate and hydrochloride. The aim of the study was to work out  prescription composition of ointment with morphine salts of optimal rheological  and morphological parameters and high pharmaceutical availability of the  therapeutic agent (morphine sulphate, hydrochloride). Three model emulsive  ointment vehicles were prepared and selected promoters of transdermal absorption  were introduced into them. On the basis of the formed vehicles ointments were  made with morphine sulphate and hydrochloride. The obtained vehicles and ointment  preparations were subjected to rheological tests. Spreadness was determined by  extensometric method and viscosity with digital cone-plate rheometer.  Morphological parameters of the vehicles and ointments, such as: pH and  pharmacopeal density were estimated. Carrying out direct diffusion from the  surface of the preparation to acceptor fluid (to water), the amount of the  released therapeutic substance in time function was determined by  spectrophotometric method. The performed tests demonstrated that the investigated  vehicles and ointments are non-Newtonian systems, viscoelastic and highly  thixotropic. The kind of morphine salt affects the spreadness and viscosity of  model ointments. Preparations with morphine hydrochloride have higher spreadness  than viscosity and more alkaline pH. From among the investigated non-ionic  surface active compounds Rokacet R-40 appeared to be the most beneficial promotor  of transdermal absorption for both pharmacopeal morphine salts. Pharmaceutical  availability of morphine sulphate and hydrochloride is the highest from ointments  with its content in the vehicle prescription.","2006","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","17-32","","2","36","","Polim Med","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 17022153","","","","Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Viscosity; Administration, Cutaneous; Diffusion; Skin Absorption/drug effects; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Fatty Acids/chemistry/*pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Ointments/administration & dosage; Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry/*pharmacology; Rheology/classification; Surface-Active Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, we determined the pharmacokinetics and  pharmacodynamics of analgesic effects of morphine and fentanyl in 35 dogs aged 1  to 34 days. Opioids were infused to produce analgesia, response times to a  noxious thermal stimulus were measured and plasma opioid concentrations were  determined. An effect compartment pharmacodynamic model was fit to the values for  time to response to determine the rate constant for equilibration (Keo) between  plasma and effect-site (Ce) concentrations and analgesic effect (increase in time  to response to a noxious stimulus) above baseline per microgram/ml of Ce (delta).  A time-to-event data analysis (modeled with a Weibull function) was used to  account for censored time to response values. For both opioids, values for Keo  did not vary with age. Values for delta decreased with age (i.e., decreasing  sensitivity with increasing age), and the magnitude of the change during the  first month of life was similar for the two opioids. In the context of our  previous study concerning ventilatory depressant effects of these opioids (that  sensitivity to morphine, but not to fentanyl, decreased markedly during the first  month of life), these results in dogs suggest that fentanyl has greater utility  than morphine in neonates during spontaneous ventilation.","1998-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","136-141","","1","284","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9435171","","","","Animals; Dogs; Animals, Newborn; Analgesia; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Fentanyl/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A strong inverse correlation was noted between the  apparent permeability coefficient and the gestational age of the skin (P < 0.01;  n = 26). The calculated apparent permeability coefficients decreased with  gestational age from 6.0 x 10(-2) cm.hr-1 at 24 weeks' gestation to 5.2 x 10(-6)  cm.hr-1 at 36 weeks' gestation. The amount of diamorphine remaining bound within  the skin at the end of the in vitro experiments did not change significantly with  gestational age of the skin. Diamorphine was subject to degradation over the  course of the in vitro experiments to produce significant amounts of  6-monoacetylmorphine and evidence is presented to suggest that this was due to  residual skin esterase activity. It is calculated that the steady-state flux rate  of diamorphine through neonatal skin observed in these experiments would be  sufficient to obtain a therapeutic plasma concentration of morphine assuming a  2-cm2 area for application and a delivery rate of 15 micrograms hr-1 kg-1.  However, the prolonged half-life of morphine in the premature neonate would  result in a delay of some hours before the attainment of this level.","1993-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","583-587","","4","10","","Pharm Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8483842","","","","Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Infant, Newborn; Gestational Age; *Skin Absorption; Infant, Premature/*metabolism; Frozen Sections; Morphine Derivatives/blood; Heroin/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with the plain morphine  group, addition of epinephrine significantly decreased morphine concentrations in  the azygos vein only at 5 and 10min after administration. At 15 and 30min after  administration, the azygos vein morphine concentrations in the epinephrine group  were at the same level as in the plain morphine group. The admixture of  epinephrine with epidural morphine increased the individual variation in the half  life of morphine concentrations in the azygos vein. All these results suggest  that addition of epinephrine does not play a particularly important role in  causing prolonged and profound analgesia after epidural morphine.","1990-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","184-187","","2","39","","Masui","","","","","","","","jpn","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 2325251","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; *Analgesia, Epidural; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Epinephrine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five patients  received first a loading dose of intravenous meperidine after umbilical cord  clamping, then patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous meperidine,  and finally meperidine tablets as needed. Five patients received morphine in the  same manner. Treatment groups showed no differences with respect to neonatal  Apgar scores or visual analog scale (VAS) pain or satisfaction scores at 24 and  48 h postpartum. Breast milk specimens, obtained at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h  postpartum and analyzed for opioids and metabolites, showed persistently elevated  normeperidine concentrations in the meperidine group. A blinded psychologist  evaluated each infant once on the 3rd day of life with the Brazelton Neonatal  Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). A priori, the ""alertness"" and three ""human  orientation"" outcomes of the NBAS were chosen for analysis as best measures of  opioid-induced effects. On all four outcomes, neonates in the morphine group  scored significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than neonates in the meperidine  group. We conclude that post-cesarean delivery PCA with morphine provides  equivalent maternal analgesia and overall satisfaction as that provided by PCA  with meperidine, but with significantly less neurobehavioral depression among  breast-fed neonates on the 3rd day of life.","1990-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","864-869","","5","73","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2240676","","","","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Cesarean Section; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Milk, Human/*chemistry; Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy; *Analgesia, Obstetrical; Colostrum/chemistry; Anesthesia, Epidural; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Behavior/*drug effects; Cholinesterase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Meperidine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may result in nonlinear plasma  concentration-dependent brain extracellular fluid (brain(ECF)) pharmacokinetics  of morphine. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of nonlinear BBB  transport on brain(ECF) pharmacokinetics of morphine and its metabolites for  different dosing strategies using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic  simulation study. We extended the human physiologically based pharmacokinetic  LeiCNS-PK3.0, model with equations for nonlinear BBB transport of morphine.  Simulations for brain(ECF) pharmacokinetics were performed for various dosing  strategies: intravenous (IV), oral immediate (IR) and extended release (ER) with  dose range of 0.25-150 mg and dosing frequencies of 1-6 times daily. The impact  of nonlinear BBB transport on morphine CNS pharmacokinetics was evaluated by  quantifying (i) the relative brain(ECF) to plasma exposure  (AUC(u,brainECF)/AUC(u),(p)(lasma)) and (ii) the impact on the peak-to-trough  ratio (PTR) of concentration-time profiles in brain(ECF) and plasma. We found  that the relative morphine exposure and PTRs are dose dependent for the evaluated  dose range. The highest relative morphine exposure value of 1.4 was found for  once daily 0.25 mg ER and lowest of 0.1 for 6-daily 150 mg IV dosing. At lower  doses the PTRs were smaller and increased with increasing dose and stabilized at  higher doses independent of dosing frequency. Relative peak concentrations of  morphine in relation to its metabolites changed with increasing dose. We conclude  that nonlinearity of morphine BBB transport affects the relative brain(ECF)  exposure and the fluctuation of morphine and its metabolites mainly at lower  dosing regimens.","2023-08-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","106482","","","187","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

Evidence supporting a vascular route for redistribution of opioids between the  epidural space and the spinal cord.","Anesthesiology","","0003-3022","10.1097/00000542-199306000-00016","","BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that opioids may move from the epidural space to the spinal cord by way of the spinal radicular arteries. However, there are no  data that address this proposed mechanism. The goal of the current study was to  determine whether the radicular arterial supply of the spinal cord is a viable  route for movement of opioids between the epidural space and spinal cord.  METHODS: The carotid and femoral arteries of anesthetized rabbits were exposed,  ligated distally, and cannulated proximal to the ligature. A fluid reservoir was  placed around the study vessel and filled with saline buffered to pH = 7.4 or  9.0. The study drug (morphine, fentanyl, or alfentanil) and a radiolabeled tracer  were added to the reservoir. Blood was collected as it flowed through the  arterial segment bathed by the fluid reservoir and analyzed by scintillation  counting to determine how much drug diffused through the arterial wall per  minute. RESULTS: Relative flux rates through the carotid artery at pH = 7.4 were  alfentanil flux > fentanyl > morphine. Increasing the pH to 9.0 resulted in a  significant decrease in fentanyl's flux, but no significant change in  alfentanil's or morphine's flux. In addition, the data demonstrate a biphasic  relationship between octanol:buffer distribution coefficient and transarterial  flux rates. CONCLUSIONS: Because the critical step in transporting drug via  radicular arteries is diffusion through the radicular artery wall, these data  support the idea that drugs may gain direct access to the spinal cord by  diffusing into the radicular arteries as they traverse the epidural space en  route to the spinal cord.","1993-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1126-1131","","6","78","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8512105","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rabbits; Spinal Cord/*metabolism; Morphine/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Epidural Space/*metabolism; *Arteries; Alfentanil/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Fentanyl/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three  rabbits (R1, R2 and R3) were given dosages of 12.5, 25.0 and 50.0 mg/h of  morphine over a 3 h period via continuous ear artery perfusion. These dosages and  time of perfusion were calculated to create tissue concentrations of morphine  similar to those encountered in human death due to overdose. Morphine blood level  plateau was attained after 1 h of perfusion. A fourth rabbit was used as a  control. To evaluate drug concentrations, tissues were sampled using a  coelioscopic technique. Approximately 400 eggs of Lucilia sericata, all of the  same age category, were placed in eyes, nostrils and mouth of each rabbit  carcass. Larvae and puparia were regularly collected from each rabbit for  toxicological analysis. The concentrations of the drug in the tissues sampled  were determined to be similar to those normally encountered in human overdoses  and were correlated with the dosage of morphine that had been administered.  Morphine was detected in all larvae and pupae fed on tissues from carcasses  administered morphine, except for puparia from the colony fed on the R1 animal  which received 12.5 mg/h dosage of morphine. All samples from the control rabbit  were negative for morphine. Concentrations of morphine in larvae reared on rabbit  carcasses containing morphine were 30 to 100 times lower than the concentrations  found in the tissues. A correlation between the tissue concentrations and larval  concentrations was found in only 3rd instar larvae (80 to 140 h following  hatching).

Some forms are more  efficacious because they are uncharged and can penetrate lipid membranes more  easily than the charged forms. Persons who administer pharmacologic agents to  ectotherms (that is, cold-blooded animals) should consider the effect of  temperature on the relative amounts of the different forms of drugs. For example,  the fraction of morphine present in the uncharged form is twice as high in a fish  or frog at 5 degrees C as in a mammal at 37 degrees C. Moreover, because the pH  of blood, plasma, and tissues of ectotherms is higher when they are held at lower  temperatures, the combined effect of temperature and pH on the speciation of  pharmacologic agents also should be considered.

This study was designed to  characterize the behavioral sensitization produced by daily morphine and to  evaluate the involvement of the mesolimbic and/or mesocortical dopamine (DA)  neurons. Daily injection of morphine for 7 days produced an increase in both  horizontal and vertical photocell counts. There was no difference in morphine  levels in the blood or brain between daily morphine- and daily saline-treated  rats at 30 or 90 min after acute injection of morphine. The increase was present  for 60 days after initiating treatment and was associated with increases in  locomotion, rearing, sniffing, grooming and bursting. Sensitization to morphine  was prevented by pretreatment with naloxone i.p. or naltrexone methobromide  injection into the ventral tegmental area (VTA; location of A10 DA perikarya  projecting to limbic and cortical areas). In contrast, pretreatment with the same  dose of naltrexone methobromide injected into the nucleus accumbens (limbic DA  terminal field) or lateral ventricles did not significantly attenuate behavioral  sensitization to morphine.

With this experiment, we hoped to resolve whether epinephrine  does or does not alter vascular absorption of extradurally injected opiates.  Thirty patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy were given either extradural  diacetylmorphine, 5 mg, extradural diacetylmorphine, 5 mg with 1:200,000  epinephrine, or 1:200,000 epinephrine followed 5 min later by 5 mg extradural  diacetylmorphine.

Significantly lower plasma morphine levels occurred  between 3 and 20 min when epinephrine was added to diacetylmorphine. Peak plasma  morphine levels (mean +/- SEM) were 179 +/- 37 nmol/L with diacetylmorphine  alone, 87 +/- 16 nmol/L with diacetylmorphine and epinephrine given together and  44 +/- 11 nmol/L with epinephrine pretreatment, all significantly different from  one another. The mean peak plasma morphine concentration was 8.7 +/- 1.1 min for  diacetylmorphine alone, but addition of epinephrine (together or sequentially)  meant that 15 of 20 patients had no peak level before 120 min.

DESIGN: Systematic review within four databases  for all studies published from 1963 to July 2019. SETTING: All paediatric  settings. ELIGIBILITY: All studies comparing Mo to Hm in individuals younger than  21 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was to compare clinical  efficacy and side effects of Mo and Hm. The secondary outcomes were the  comparison of pharmacokinetic profiles and the description of predefined Mo to Hm  conversion ratios used across the paediatric literature. RESULTS: Among 754  abstracts reviewed, 59 full-text articles met inclusion criteria and 24 studies  were included in the analysis: 4 studies compared pharmacodynamics of Mo and Hm  and 20 studies reported the use of a predefined Mo to Hm conversion ratio. Most  studies had a poor methodological quality. Available evidence suggests that, when  given intravenously, the equianalgesic ratio of Mo to Hm is 5:1. Intravenous  administration with this ratio results in a similar rate of adverse effects,  including pruritus and nausea. The epidural administration with a ratio of 10:1  results in more pruritus and urinary retention with Mo than Hm. Pharmacokinetic  data were reported in only one study. A wide range of pre-established ratios for  different routes of administration were reported, but few were based on evidence.  CONCLUSION: Current literature does not permit a rational choice between Mo and  Hm. A ratio of 5:1 seems adequate for intravenous administration and leads to a  similar rate of adverse effects.","2021-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1002-1009","","10","106","","Arch Dis Child","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Chronic treatment with L-arginine, but not D-arginine,  decreased the antinociceptive response to morphine in mice, increased the  activity of nitric oxide synthase in the midbrain and decreased brain levels of  morphine, compared with vehicle-injected controls. Significant decreases in  morphine levels were observed in midbrain, pons and medulla, hippocampus,  striatum and spinal cord of L-arginine-treated mice, in comparison with  vehicle-injected mice. However, the levels of morphine in cortex, amygdala and  hypothalamus of L-arginine- or D-arginine-treated mice did not differ from those  of vehicle-injected controls. Acute treatment with L-arginine (200 mg/kg i.p.) or  D-arginine (200 mg/kg i.p.) did not modify either morphine antinociception or  morphine distribution in brain regions or the spinal cord. Chronic administration  of L-arginine or D-arginine did not alter the Bmax or Kd values of  [3H][D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin binding to the mouse brain membranes. These  results suggest that chronic treatment with L-arginine reduces the  antinociceptive effect of morphine by increasing brain nitric oxide synthase  activity and by decreasing the concentration of morphine in certain brain regions  and spinal cord.","1997-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","707-712","","2","281","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9152376","","","","Male; Animals; Tritium; Mice; Tissue Distribution; Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism; Arginine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Enkephalins/metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid/metabolism; Morphine/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Brain/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism; Spinal Cord/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G.","Characterization of stress-induced potentiation of opioid effects in the rat.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","","0022-3565","","","This study was designed to evaluate systematically the effects of stress on actions of exogenously administered opioids. Dose- and time-dependent analgesic  (tail-flick) and thermic (core body temperature) effects of morphine and  methadone were determined in unstressed rats and in rats exposed to the stress of  restraint or a cold environment. To assess the role of the  pituitary-adrencortical axis in stress-opioid interactions, tests were performed  in hypophysectomized and pituitary-intact rats. The analgesic effect of morphine  was greater in all stressed groups than in unstressed controls and was greater  still in all groups of hypophysectomized rats than in corresponding groups of  intact animals. The analgesic effect of methadone was also greater in all groups  of stressed as compared to unstressed rats but was not modified by  hypophysectomy, in contrast to the situation with morphine. The effects of both  opioids on body temperature varied quantitatively and qualitatively as a function  of dose, conditions under which the animals were tested and presence or absence  of the pituitary gland. Doses that increased temperature in unstressed  pituitary-intact rats decreased temperature in unstressed hypophysectomized rats  and in all stressed rats. Brain and plasma levels of morphine were comparable in  stressed and unstressed pituitary-intact rats, but were significantly higher in  unstressed hypophysectomized animals. Thus, hypophysectomy-induced potentiation  of the analgesic effect of morphine is probably due to pharmacokinetic factors  whereas stress-induced potentiation of opioid analgesia appears to be a distinct  phenomenon, one that is independent of the pituitary-adrencortical axis and  general for the pharmacologic class of morphine-like drugs. The well-documented  hypothermic response of restrained rats to doses of opioids that increase or have  no affect on the body temperature of unrestrained animals appears to represent  another example of stress-induced potentiation of opioid effects.","1984-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","555-565","","3","231","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6502514","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Body Temperature/drug effects; Narcotics/*pharmacology; Hypophysectomy; Analgesia; Methadone/pharmacology; Morphine/metabolism/pharmacology; Stress, Physiological/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  is implemented by creating physical barriers, inseparably combining the opioid  with an opioid antagonist or adding aversive agents to the formulation. These  pharmaceutical changes may potentially alter the pharmacokinetics and  consequently the pharmacodynamics of the opioid. In this review, comparative  evidence on pharmacokinetic differences between abuse-deterrent and classical  formulations of the same opioids is summarized; furthermore, pharmacodynamic  differences, with a focus on analgesia and abuse-related symptoms, are addressed.  Most of the 12 studies comparing opioid pharmacokinetics have judged the  physically intact ADF as being bioequivalent to the corresponding classical  formulation. Pharmacokinetic differences have, however, been reported with  physically manipulated ADFs and have ranged from moderate deviations from  bioequivalence to complete changes in the pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. from a  sustained-release formulation to a fast-release formulation). Pharmacodynamic  effects were assessed in 14 comparative studies, which reported that intact ADFs  usually provided clinically equivalent analgesia and clear advantages with  respect to their addiction potential. However, withdrawal symptoms could be  induced by the ADFs, although rarely and, in particular, when the ADFs had been  physically altered. This evidence suggests that opioid ADFs are a working concept  resulting in mostly minor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences in  comparison with classical formulations; however, they may deviate from this  equivalence when physically altered.","2016-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:51:44","","751-767","","7","55","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Walter2016a PMID: 26719075 place: Switzerland","","","","Humans; Pain/*drug therapy; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/*methods; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Buprenorphine/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Oxycodone/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Oxymorphone/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a set of single-dose experiments, morphine was  administered to recirculating perfusion medium to achieve initial concentrations  of 0.2, 2 and 20 microM (n = 4 at each concentration). In a set of multiple-dose  experiments, morphine was administered to perfusate as sequential bolus doses to  achieve concentrations of 0.2, 2, 20 and 200 microM (n = 6). HPLC was used to  determine the concentration of morphine in perfusate and urine. Normorphine,  morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide could not be detected in  perfusate or urine, a result that suggests an absence of oxidative and  glucuronidative metabolism of morphine by the rat kidney. The volume of  distribution of morphine within the kidney was high (31 +/- 3 ml/g at 0.2  microM), which indicates extensive accumulation, and remained constant with  increasing perfusate concentration. The ratio of unbound renal excretory  clearance to glomerular filtration rate was always greater than unity for all  kidneys, which indicates that the renal excretion of morphine involves net  tubular secretion. This ratio was constant (P > .05) over the 100-fold  concentration range of the single-dose study. In the multiple-dose study, the  ratio was marginally but significantly (P < .05) higher at concentrations of 2,  20 and 200 microM than at 0.2 microM, a difference that cannot be explained by  saturation of tubular secretion. The results suggest that the tubular secretion  of morphine is not saturated over a wide range of concentrations (0.2-200  microM).","1997-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1518-1525","","3","282","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9316867","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Perfusion; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Kidney/*metabolism; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA  SOURCES: MEDLINE (1946 to November 2015), EMBASE (1974 to November 2015),  International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to December 2014), and Cochrane  Database of Systematic Reviews (2005 to November 2015). KEYWORDS: morphine,  hydromorphone, fentanyl, trauma, acute pain, intravenous, opioid,  pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION:  Literature characterizing opioid PK-PD was included. Additionally, studies  evaluatingoutcomes of opioids for acute severe pain in adult trauma patients were  selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: PK-PD literature suggests that morphine exhibits an  effect delay of 1.6 to 4.8 hours; however, clinical significance is doubtful. The  relative onset of morphine is approximately 6 minutes, and duration, 96 minutes.  Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV then 0.05 mg/kg every 5 minutes achieved pain control in  40% of patients at 10 minutes and 76% at 60 minutes. The effect delay of  hydromorphone (orally) is 18 to 38 minutes; its relative onset (IV), 5 minutes;  and duration, 120 minutes. Hydromorphone every 15 minutes achieved variable  success in clinical trials. The effect delay of fentanyl IV is 16.4 minutes;  relative onset, 2 minutes; and duration, 7 minutes. One randomized controlled  trial used fentanyl 0.1 µg/kg IV every 5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Further  integration of opioid PK-PD into acutepain protocols is possible. One opioid  should not be deemed more effective but rather titrated to effect. Morphine and  hydromorphone can be titrated IV every 5 minutes until adequate pain control.  Fentanyl can be titrated every 3 minutes.","2016-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","209-218","","3","50","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2016.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26739277","","","","Humans; pharmacokinetics; opioids; Pain Measurement; pharmacodynamics; Pain/*drug therapy/physiopathology; acute pain; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Pain Management; Fentanyl/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Hydromorphone/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; trauma; Wounds and Injuries/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The  disposition and respiratory effects of intrathecal morphine were studied in ten  patients (ages 4 months-15 yr) after repair of craniofacial defects. Morphine,  0.02 mg/kg, was administered intrathecally before the end of surgery.  Postoperatively, we determined the minute ventilation (VE) in response to  increasing partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) during carbon  dioxide rebreathing. The slope (VE/PETCO2) and intercept (VE at PETCO2 60 mmHg,  VE 60) of the carbon dioxide response curve were calculated at 6, 12, and 18 h  after morphine administration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were analyzed  for morphine concentration by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Mean VE/PETCO2 decreased  from a preoperative value of 35.1 +/- 3.7 to 16.3 +/- 2.8 ml.kg-1 x min-1 x  mmHg-1 at 6 h after morphine, and remained depressed to 23.4 +/- 2.9 and 23.5 +/-  3.3 ml.kg-1 x min-1 x mmHg-1 at 12 h and 18 h, respectively, compared to  preoperatively). The infants' (n = 3) VE/PETCO2 at 6 h were 21, 4, and 27 ml.kg-1  x min-1 x mmHg-1. Mean VE 60 decreased from 874 +/- 125 to 276 +/- 32 ml x kg-1 x  min-1 at 6 h, but then recovered at 12 and 18 h to 491 +/- 68 and 567 +/- 82  ml.kg-1 x min-1, respectively.

In this regard, poly(lactide-co-glicolide) (PLGA) is often  used in their preparation due to its high degree of biocompatibility and  biodegradability. In the present study, morphine HCl is incorporated in PLGA-NPs  and different preparation alternatives are evaluated for their effects on the  properties, stability and capacity of encapsulation. METHODS: NPs were prepared  by a double emulsion solvent diffusion-ammonium loading (DESD-AL) or double  emulsion solvent diffusion-traditional (DESD-T) technique. NP morphology, size,  zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency were investigated. In vitro studies  were performed in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 37 ºC and deionized water at 4ºC.  Adult male Swiss mice were used to study the pharmacokinetic behavior in vivo.  RESULTS: Our results show that DESD-AL provides a higher level of morphine  entrapment and that increasing the sonication time reduces the size but does not  appreciably reduce the entrapment percentage. It was also observed that NP  stability was greater when Pluronic F68 was used rather than PVA, and that in  vitro assays provided better results with low concentrations of both stabilizers.  Lyophilized NPs, after rehydration showed properties that were only slightly  different from those of the untreated ones, with no sign of precipitation or  aggregation. Finally, the obtained NPs enhanced morphine bioavailability.  CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a useful method for encapsulating morphine in order  to obtain an extended delivery period is described and its effects are compared  with those of the free drug.","2017","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","2015-2025","","13","23","","Curr Pharm Des","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 27908267","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; pharmacokinetics; Morphine; nanoparticles; PLGA; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer; Lactic Acid/*blood/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics; lyophilized; Morphine Derivatives/*blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics; Nanoparticles/*chemistry/*metabolism; poly(lactide-co-glicolide) (PLGA); Polyglycolic Acid/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that morphine's potency would  be enhanced in mice receiving THC and morphine by conventional per os (p.o.) and  subcutaneously (s.c.) routes of administration. Antinociception was measured in  the tail-flick test of radiant heat after administration of different  combinations of THC and morphine p.o. and s.c. Subcutaneous administration of THC  (4 and 25 mg/kg) increased the potency of s.c. morphine 8.5- and 22.3-fold,  respectively, while s.c. THC (25 mg/kg) increased the potency of p.o. morphine  3.1-fold. Per os administration of THC (10 and 20 mg/kg) increased the potency of  s.c. and p.o. morphine 11.4-fold and 7.6-fold, respectively. Thus, morphine's  potency was significantly increased regardless of the enteral and parenteral  routes of THC and morphine administration. The synthetic receptor selective  cannabinoid CP-55, 940 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) also enhanced morphine's potency.  Finally, the ability of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A to antagonize the  enhancement of morphine by THC indicates that THC was acting through a  cannabinoid receptor mechanism.","1998-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","559-566","","2","60","","Pharmacol Biochem Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9632241","","","","Male; Animals; Drug Synergism; Mice; Reaction Time/drug effects; Mice, Inbred ICR; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Dronabinol/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Hallucinogens/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Receptors, Cannabinoid; Receptors, Drug/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of buprenorphine.","Palliative medicine","","0269-2163","","","Impairment of renal function is common among elderly patients due to an age-related decline in renal excretory function. In addition, many diseases such  as hypertension and diabetes mellitus are associated with an accelerated decline  in renal function. Renal dysfunction affects the metabolism of compounds and thus  has important therapeutic consequences for drug safety. For pain patients who  have reduced renal function such as those in palliative care, most opioids used  for chronic pain treatment should be administered at reduced dosages, with  increased dosage intervals, or not at all because of the risk of accumulation of  the parent compound or its metabolites. For instance, for morphine or codeine,  active metabolites are formed in the liver and cleared by the kidney and may  therefore accumulate in cases of renal dysfunction. In contrast, buprenorphine  can be administered at normal doses in patients with renal dysfunction because it  is mainly excreted through the liver. In patients undergoing regular  haemodialysis treatment, removal of an opioid during dialysis varies between  individuals based upon a number of factors including the dialysis technique used.  Morphine appears to be difficult to process in haemodialysis patients due to  possible 'rebound' of metabolites between dialysis sessions. By contrast, the  pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine are unchanged in haemodialysis patients, which  means that there is no need for dose-reduction with this drug. Thus, in patients  with reduced renal function, chronic renal insufficiency and haemodialysis,  buprenorphine appears to be a safe choice when opioid treatment is initiated.","2006","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","s17-23","","","20 Suppl 1","","Palliat Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16764217","","","","Adult; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Kidney Function Tests; Renal Dialysis/*adverse effects; Kidney/drug effects/metabolism; Contraindications; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Buprenorphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine/pharmacokinetics; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Pain/metabolism/*prevention & control; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramadol: no less risky than morphine.","Prescrire international","","1167-7422","","","So-called weak opioid analgesics are often used to treat severe pain, or when paracetamol or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) proves inadequate.  But are weak opioids any more effective than paracetamol or NSAIDs on nociceptive  pain, and are they better tolerated than morphine? To answer these questions, we  conducted a review of literature using the standard Prescrire methodology. The  potency of codeine and tramadol is strongly influenced by the cytochrome P450  isoenzyme CYP2D6 genotype, which varies widely from one person to another. This  explains reports of overdosing or underdosing after administration of standard  doses of the two drugs. The potency of morphine and that of buprenorphine, an  opioid receptor agonist-antagonist, appears to be independent of CYP2D6 activity.  All ""weak"" opioids can have the same dose-dependent adverse effects as morphine.  There is no evidence that, at equivalent analgesic efficacy, weak opioids carry a  lower risk of addiction than low-dose morphine. Respiratory depression can occur  in ultrarapid metabolisers after brief exposure to standard doses of codeine or  tramadol. Similar cases have been reported with dihydrocodeine in patients with  renal failure. In addition, tramadol can cause a serotonin syndrome,  hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia and seizures. Several trials have compared different  weak opioids in patients with post-operative pain. A single dose of a weak  opioid, possibly combined with paracetamol, has greater analgesic efficacy than  paracetamol alone but is not more effective than an NSAID alone. There is a  dearth of evidence on weak opioids in patients with chronic pain. Available  trials fail to show that a weak opioid has markedly superior analgesic efficacy  to paracetamol or an NSAID. Sublingual buprenorphine at analgesic doses appears  less likely to cause respiratory depression, but it seems to have weak analgesic  efficacy. In practice, when opioid therapy is needed, there is no evidence that  codeine, dihydrocodeine or tramadol is less risky than morphine at its lowest  effective dose. Compared to morphine, the efficacy of these drugs varies more  from one patient to another, and their multiple pharmacokinetic interactions can  be difficult to manage. There is also a sometimes unpredictable risk of serious  over-dose. Tramadol has additional adverse effects unrelated to its opioid  effects. Weak opioids require at least as much vigilance as morphine, despite the  major differences in their reputation and regulation.","2016-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","45-50","","168","25","","Prescrire Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 27042732","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Respiration/drug effects; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects; Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects; Morphine/*adverse effects; Chronic Pain/drug therapy; Codeine/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives; Tramadol/*adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The exact mechanism behind the gastrointestinal effects  is not known, but experimental studies indicate both central and peripheral  actions. In an attempt to clarify to what extent the systemic effects of morphine  after epidural administration contribute to the action on gastrointestinal  motility, a study aiming to resemble the situation with epidural morphine was  designed. Twenty healthy male volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups.  Group one (n = 10) received intrathecal (0.4 mg) and intramuscular (4 mg)  morphine (IT-IM-group). Group two (n = 10) received intrathecal (0.4 mg) morphine  and i.m. saline (IT-group). Gastroduodenal activity was assessed by gastric  emptying, manometry and electrogastrography. The plasma and urine concentrations  of morphine and its inactive metabolite morphine-3-and active metabolite  morphine-6-glucuronide were also determined. During the fasted state the  gastrointestinal activity is characterised by a cyclic pattern with a duration of  80-120 min in the duodenum comprising three different phases with intense  activity during Phase III. This pattern was seen in all volunteers. After the  intrathecal administration the Phase III activity occurred significantly earlier  in the IT-IM group (median 31 min; IR 34 min) compared to IT group (82 min; 37  min) (P < 0.01). The number of Phase IIIs was higher in the IT-IM group during  the first 4 h after the morphine administration, compared to the IT group.  However, after 6 h, there was no difference between the groups. The propagation  velocity of Phase III decreased significantly in both groups (P < 0.001), but  there was no difference between the groups. Tachygastria increased significantly  with time in both groups. The acetaminophen absorption test showed that the area  under the concentration curve (120 min) was significantly smaller in the IT-IM  group compared to the IT group (P < 0.05). There were no measurable plasma  concentrations of morphine or the glucoronidated metabolites M3G and M6G in the  group that only received intrathecal morphine. This study showed that intrathecal  morphine (0.4 mg) influenced gastroduodenal motility and that intramuscular  morphine (4 mg) gave additional effects.

To evaluate pain intensity, a visual  analogue scale (VAS) and the Present Pain Intensity scale of the McGill Pain  Questionnaire were used. Additional morphine solution for breakthrough pain was  used as an outcome measure. Pain was evaluated nine times daily, which permitted  correlation of pain scores with the pharmacokinetic patterns of the test drugs.  Side effects were rated once daily, using a scale from 0 to 3. To assess the  relative importance of side effects, a toxicity index was designed based on both  the intensity and duration of each side effect.

Inflammation was induced by the intragastric (p.o.)  administration of one (acute) or two (chronic) doses of croton oil (CO), whereas  controls received saline (SS). Intestinal PER was assessed by the blood-to-lumen  transfer of 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (51Cr-EDTA). CO significantly  increased PER during acute (2.5 times) and chronic (3.2 times) inflammation. The  potency of s.c. morphine-inhibiting PER was enhanced 3.8 and 8.7 times in acute  and chronic CO, whereas that of s.c. fentanyl was increased 2.0 and 4.3 times,  respectively, compared with SS. Similarly, s.c. [D-Pen(2,5)]-enkephalin was 4.7  and 11.1 times more potent during acute and chronic CO, and the E(max) values of  the dose-response curves increased 35% during inflammation. The potency of s.c.  U50,488H was 5.6 (acute) and 6.7 times (chronic) greater compared with SS. All  effects were reversed by specific antagonists. The i.p. administration of  beta-funaltrexamine differentially blocked morphine effects during acute and  chronic CO, suggesting that the effects are mediated by different populations of  functional mu-opioid receptors (OR). The increase in potencies of s.c. PL017 and  ICI-204,448 during CO were comparable to those observed with fentanyl and  U50,488H and their effects were antagonized by s.c. naloxone methiodide.

Higher doses were toxic and  induced convulsions. However, the pika is responsive to synthetic opiates such as  etorphine, pentazocine and phenoperidine. Interestingly enough, morphine  antagonized the opiate response elicited by those narcotics to which the animal  is sensitive. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that morphine enters the  pika's brain as readily as it does the rat's. In addition, opiate receptor sites,  which are present in normal amounts in pika brain retained their high affinity  for 3H-etorphine (KD = 0.3 nM), 3H-naloxone (KD = 1.2 nM) and morphine. Moreover,  binding of morphine to pika brain homogenates was inhibited in the presence of  sodium ions (agonist response). Therefore, the antagonism of phenoperidine action  by morphine appeared not to occur at the opiate receptor site; the mechanism of  the pika's natural tolerance to morphine may reside in molecular events that  normally preceed (metabolism?) or follow (enzyme activation?) the interaction  between the drug and its specific recognition sites.","1979-02-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","343-349","","4","53","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 217697","","","","Male; Female; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Brain/metabolism; Drug Tolerance; Receptors, Opioid/metabolism; Morphine/metabolism/*pharmacology; Lagomorpha/*metabolism; Mammals/*metabolism; Phenoperidine/antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the  present study, the effects of cocaine and morphine on the discriminative stimulus  effects of morphine and cocaine, respectively, were examined. Furthermore,  dopaminergic mediation in the discriminative stimulus effects of morphine was  also examined. Pretreatment with 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg morphine shifted the  dose-response curve for cocaine to the left, and 3.0 mg/kg morphine significantly  potentiated the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. On the other hand,  neither 1.25 nor 2.5 mg/kg cocaine affected the discriminative stimulus effects  of morphine. These results suggest that potentiation of the discriminative  stimulus effects of cocaine by morphine may reflect the enhancement of  reinforcing effects in the combination of cocaine and morphine. Furthermore,  neither SCH23390 (D1-receptor antagonist) nor haloperidol (D2-receptor  antagonist) affects the discriminative stimulus effects of morphine, while  combining these drugs slightly attenuated the effects of morphine. Thus, another  neurotransmitter rather than dopamine may play an important role in the  discriminative stimulus effects of morphine. Therefore, the discriminative  stimulus effects of morphine are apparently not potentiated by cocaine, unlike  those of reinforcing effects.","1995-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","341-347","","4","67","","Jpn J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 7650866","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Drug Synergism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Haloperidol/pharmacology; Rats, Inbred F344; Naloxone/pharmacology; Discrimination Learning/*drug effects; Benzazepines/pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Discrimination, Psychological/*drug effects; Cocaine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Synaptic Transmission/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methadone was avidly extracted  from portal venous blood (86.1 +/- 0.81%) in a single pass through the liver  after a bolus injection (1.5 mg) into a nonrecirculating perfusion system.  Hepatic extraction of methadone was independent of rate of hepatic blood flow  (0.59 to 1.53 ml per g of liver per min) but was altered by increasing the total  amount of methadone injected. After a bolus injection of 15.0 and 75.0 mg, the  proportions of methadone extracted were reduced to 75 and 56%, respectively. The  hepatic extraction of morphine (1.5 mg) was 25%, of diacetylmorphine (1.5 mg)  59%, and of meperidine (1.5 mg) 66% in a single pass, all significantly lower (P  less than 0.01) than that of methadone. Subcellular fractionation of whole liver  homogenates after a single pass of drug showed that methadone and its metabolites  were localized primarily in the fractions containing nuclei, mitochondria,  microsomes, and other membranes, whereas morphine was primarily localized in the  supernatant cytosol. Unchanged methadone was shown to be slowly released from the  liver into hepatic effluent blood along with small amounts of the inactive  pyrrolidine and pyrroline metabolites (identified by gas chromatography and mass  spectrometry). These findings suggest that the liver may serve not only as a site  of biotransformation of methadone, but also as a major reservoir for storage and  subsequent release of unchanged compound.","1978-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","88-94","","1","75","","Gastroenterology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 401102","","","","Animals; Rabbits; Time Factors; Biotransformation; Liver/*metabolism; Liver Circulation; Narcotics/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine/pharmacokinetics; Heroin/pharmacokinetics; Meperidine/pharmacokinetics; Methadone/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acute desensitization of MOR  impairs the efficiency of signaling, whereas the receptor internalization  restores the cell responsiveness to the agonists. Thereby, the property of  morphine may limit the analgesic effects of this opiate drug. It has been shown  that [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO), a potent MOR agonist inducing the  internalization, facilitates morphine to internalize MOR, suggesting that MOR  agonists with low relative activity versus endocytosis (RAVE) values such as  DAMGO can potentiate analgesic effects of morphine through stimulating MOR  internalization. The authors examined whether the acute analgesic effect of  morphine can be potentiated by low relative activity versus endocytosis agonists  DAMGO and fentanyl. METHODS: Rats injected intrathecally with opioids were  subjected to a hot plate test for antinociceptive effect. Immunostained spinal  dorsal horn was analyzed by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Fentanyl induced MOR  internalization to a lesser extent than DAMGO at equianalgesic doses.  Coadministration of fentanyl promoted morphine-induced MOR internalization. The  analgesic effect of morphine was greatly potentiated together with decrease in  the relative activity versus endocytosis value when MOR internalization was  induced by coadministration of a subanalgesic dose of DAMGO or fentanyl. In  contrast, the combination of DAMGO and fentanyl increased neither the analgesic  effect nor the internalization of MOR. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the  coadministration of morphine with MOR-internalizing agonist is clinically  applicable to develop successful pain-management regimens to achieve satisfactory  analgesia using less morphine.","2006-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","574-580","","3","105","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16931992","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Opioid, mu/*metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Fentanyl/pharmacology; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-/pharmacology; Endocytosis/*drug effects; Posterior Horn Cells/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this article is to highlight how the  features of Guardian™ Technology are linked to the ER profile and AD  characteristics of morphine-ADER-IMT. RESULTS: The ER profile of  morphine-ADER-IMT is attributed to the precise release of morphine from the  polymer matrix. The approved dosage strengths of morphine-ADER-IMT are  bioequivalent to corresponding dosage strengths of morphine ER (MS Contin®;  Purdue Pharma LP, Stamford, CT). Morphine-ADER-IMT was very resistant to physical  manipulations intended to reduce particle size, with <10 percent of particles  being reduced to <500µm, regarded by the US Food and Drug Administration as a  relevant cutoff for potential insufflation in their generic solid oral AD opioid  guidance. Furthermore, morphine was not readily extracted from the polymer matrix  of morphine-ADER-IMT in small- or large-volume solvent extraction studies that  evaluated the potential for intravenous and oral abuse. CONCLUSIONS: The ER  profile and AD characteristics of morphine-ADER-IMT are a result of Guardian™  Technology. The combination of the polyethylene oxide matrix and the use of  injection molding differentiate morphine-ADER-IMT from other approved AD opioids  that deter abuse using physical and chemical barriers. The high degree of  flexibility of the Guardian™ Technology enables the development of products that  can be tailored to almost any desired release profile; as such, it is a  technology platform that may be useful for the development of a wide range of  pharmaceutical products.","2017-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","465-472","","6","13","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29308592","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Solubility; Delayed-Action Preparations; Tablets; Particle Size; Drug Liberation; Drug Compounding; *Drug Carriers; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/*methods; Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry; Solvents/chemistry; Substance-Related Disorders/*prevention & control; Opioid-Related Disorders/*prevention & control; *Abuse-Deterrent Formulations/adverse effects; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry; Morphine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complicating patient treatment regimens is the fact  that pain physicians' prescribing practices may come under scrutiny by the Drug  Enforcement Agency and other licensing agencies. If questioned, doctors can be  hard-pressed to substantiate that their particular practices meet the established  standard of care. It would be helpful to establish that their patients adhere to  medications when compared with other practices. Previous studies show that  urinary excretion data transformed by mathematical models can produce a reliable  range of expected values for pain medications and may be useful to help resolve  the aforementioned issues. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To provide comparative urinary  excretion information data on three commonly prescribed opioid medications  (morphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone). METHODS: This retrospective study  involved quantitative analysis of300, 000 urine specimens for three test drugs  using previously described methods. The results were analyzed as percent  frequency distributions and logarithmic functions. RESULTS: The authors  established a creatinine-normalized range of urinary concentration values for  each drug. Results for two practices were compared with the meta-findings,  providing quantitative evidence of overall standard of care prescription practice  by that physician. CONCLUSIONS: Expected urinary drug excretion values for  morphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone can potentially benefit pain physicians by  showing that they are within the expected standard of care, helping to establish  patient compliance, and identifying patients whose metabolism of these drugs may  put them at risk.","2011-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","435-441","","6","7","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22320025","","","","Humans; Retrospective Studies; *Models, Theoretical; Medication Adherence; Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards; Chronic Pain/*drug therapy; Opioid-Related Disorders/prevention & control; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Oxycodone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Hydrocodone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the factors that influence its pharmacokinetics  (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) could improve therapeutic outcomes. We therefore  performed a pooled population PK/PD analysis using individual patient data from  two studies. We focused on the impact of morphine administration and ST-segment  elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on the risk of high platelet reactivity  (HPR) and dyspnea. METHODS: A parent-metabolite population PK/PD model was  developed based on data from 63 STEMI, 50 non-STEMI, and 25 chronic coronary  syndrome (CCS) patients. Simulations were then run to evaluate the risk of  non-response and adverse events associated with the identified variability  factors. RESULTS: The final PK model consisted of first-order absorption with  transit compartments, distribution with two compartments for ticagrelor and one  compartment for AR-C124910XX (active metabolite of ticagrelor), and linear  elimination for both drugs. The final PK/PD model was an indirect turnover model  with production inhibition. Morphine dose and STEMI, independently, had a  significant negative effect on the absorption rate (reduction of log([Formula:  see text]) by 0.21×morphine dose (mg) and by 2.37 in STEMI patients, both  p < 0.001), and the presence of STEMI significantly impacted both efficacy and  potency (both p < 0.001). The simulations run with the validated model showed a  high rate of non-response in patients with those covariates (RR 1.19 for  morphine, 4.11 for STEMI and 5.73 for morphine and STEMI, all three p < 0.001).  By increasing ticagrelor dosage, the negative morphine effect was reversible in  patients without STEMI and just limited in patients with STEMI. CONCLUSION: The  developed population PK/PD model confirmed the negative impact of morphine  administration and presence of STEMI on ticagrelor PK and antiplatelet effect.  Increasing ticagrelor doses seems effective in morphine users without STEMI,  whereas the STEMI effect is not entirely reversible.","2023-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","905-920","","6","62","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

During each session, a single dose of MOR sulfate (0, 5 and 10 mg/70 kg) was  administered i.v. in combination with a single dose of COC hydrochloride (0, 8,  16 and 32 mg/70 kg). All possible COC-MOR combinations were each tested once.  Measures of subjective effects were obtained repeatedly, heart rate, diastolic  and systolic blood pressure were sampled every 2 min and blood levels of COC and  MOR were obtained at three time points. Both COC and MOR alone significantly  increased peak heart rate, diastolic pressure and systolic pressure. The  cardiovascular effects of COC were larger and longer in duration than morphine,  as indicated by larger area under the curve measures compared to MOR. COC alone  increased visual analog scales ratings of ""stimulated"" and A scores of the  Addiction Research Center Inventory, whereas MOR alone increased opiate symptoms  and ratings of ""sedated"" and both drugs increased ratings of ""high."" For the most  part, the cardiovascular effects of COC-MOR combinations could be predicted by  the effects of COC alone, and the subjective effects of the combinations could be  predicted by either drug alone. The drug combination produced increases in  cardiovascular and subjective effects that were less than predicted by an effect  addition model of drug interaction. The disposition of both COC and MOR was  unaffected by the presence of the other drug. These results suggest that the  self-administration of this drug combination may be related to a unique profile  of opiate and stimulant effects instead of an alteration in the effects produced  by either drug alone.","1992-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","623-632","","2","261","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1578376","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Injections, Intravenous; Drug Combinations; Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Heart Rate/*drug effects; Surveys and Questionnaires; Morphine/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Cocaine/blood/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effective plasma  concentrations are maintained for up to 48-72 hours after application of a  transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) fentanyl patch. In a multicentre study,  slow-release morphine was replaced by TTS fentanyl according to a special  calculation table (10 mg oral morphine corresponding to approximately 0.1 mg TTS  fentanyl). Ninety-eight patients were included in the study. Due to protocol  infringements, however, the switch from oral morphine to TTS fentanyl could be  assessed for only 38 patients. The changeover at a ratio of 100:1 proved to be  safe and effective and a good alternative therapy to conventional strong opioids.  The majority of the patients wished to continue TTS fentanyl therapy at the end  of the study period. Side effects were similar to those associated with other  opioids. However, TTS fentanyl was associated with a distinct decrease in  constipation and a significant reduction in the use of laxatives. Furthermore,  there were some indications that compliance may be increased with TTS fentanyl.  Special indications for chronic pain therapy using transdermal opioids include  head and neck and gastro-intestinal tract cancer. In these cases, TTS fentanyl  may be the final non-invasive form of analgesic therapy which allows the patient  to maintain a normal lifestyle. TTS fentanyl thus represents a new alternative  for therapy with strong opioids on step III of the World Health Organization  analgesic ladder.","1995-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","39-43","","","6 Suppl 3","","Anticancer Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 7606035","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Administration, Oral; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Pain/*drug therapy; Heart Rate/drug effects; Administration, Cutaneous; Erythema/chemically induced; Ambulatory Care; Neoplasms/*physiopathology; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Drug Delivery Systems/methods/trends; Fentanyl/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Neoplasm Metastasis/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Binding studies were also performed using both purified  human serum albumin and human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). Albumin was found  to be the major binding protein for both oxycodone and morphine. The serum  protein binding of both oxycodone and morphine was independent of drug  concentration in the therapeutic range (5-100 ng/ml), but was dependent on  protein concentration. In addition, bound fractions of oxycodone and morphine  increased with increasing concentrations of both albumin and AAG.

The present study tests the hypothesis that expression  of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is modulated by the administration of  the morphine metabolite, morphine-6beta-glucuronide. The initial study using rats  shows that morphine-6beta-glucuronide administration (0, 1.0, 3.163, 10 mg/kg  s.c.) results in a pronounced reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  expression of iNOS (inducible nitricoxide synthease) in spleen, lung, and liver  tissue as measured by western blotting. Morphine-6beta-glucuronide also produces  a reduction in the level of plasma nitrite/nitrate, the more stable end-product  of nitric oxide degradation. In a subsequent study, administration of the opioid  receptor antagonist, naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) prior to the injection of  morphine-6beta-glucuronide (10 mg/kg) blocks the morphine-6beta-glucuronide  induced reduction of iNOS expression and plasma nitrite/nitrite levels indicating  that the effect is mediated via the opioid-receptor. This study provides the  first evidence that morphine-6beta-glucuronide alters the expression of iNOS.","2001-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","267-275","","4","25","","Inflammation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11580103","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Rats, Inbred Lew; Tissue Distribution; Liver/enzymology; Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II; Nitrates/blood; Lung/enzymology; Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology; Naltrexone/pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Nitric Oxide Synthase/*drug effects/metabolism; Spleen/enzymology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both opioid and NPFF  systems played important roles in thermoregulation, which suggested a link  between opioid receptors and NPFF receptors in the production of hypothermia.  Therefore, we designed a study to investigate the relationship between opioid and  NPFF in control of thermoregulation in mice. The selective NPFF receptors  antagonist RF9 (30nmol) injected into the third ventricle failed to induce  significant effect, but it completely antagonized the hypothermia of NPFF (45  nmol) after cerebral administration in mice. In addition, RF9 (30 nmol)  co-injected i.c.v. in the third ventricle reduced the hypothermia induced by  morphine (5nmol,) or nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) (2 nmol). Neither the  classical opioid receptors antagonist naloxone (10 nmol) nor NOP receptor  antagonist [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH(2) (7.5 nmol) reduced the hypothermia induced by  the central injection of NPFF at dose of 45 nmol. Co-injected with a low dose of  NPFF (5 nmol), the hypothermia of morphine (5 nmol) or N/OFQ (2 nmol) was not  modified. These results suggest that NPFF receptors activation is required for  opioid to produce hypothermia. In contrast, NPFF-induced hypothermia is mainly  mediated by its own receptors, independent of opioid receptors in the mouse  brain. This interaction, quantitated in the present study, is the first evidence  that NPFF receptors mediate opioid-induced hypothermia in conscious animals.","2008-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:50:30","","1183-1190","","7","29","","Peptides","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Wang2008c PMID: 18406009 place: United States","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Mice; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Naloxone/pharmacology; Dipeptides/*pharmacology; Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Body Temperature Regulation/*drug effects; Hypothermia/chemically induced/metabolism; Opioid Peptides/pharmacology; Receptors, Neuropeptide/*antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  opioids evaluated included heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl and meperidine;  each of these drugs has the potential for abuse in humans. Inhalation exposure to  each of these compounds produced antinociception in a dose-dependent manner as  assessed in the tall-flick test. No pyrolysis products were detected after  heating either morphine or codeine at 250 degrees C for 5 min. Although  6-acetylmorphine was found after heating heroin, it accounted for less than 5% of  the recovered sample. Heroin was somewhat less potent by inhalation  administration than i.v. injection, with ED50 values of 1.6 and 0.69 mumol/kg,  respectively. In contrast, the relative potency of morphine was substantially  greater when inhaled than when injected, with respective ED50 values of 0.77 and  3.9 mumol/kg. Whereas the body to brain ratios of [3H]morphine were approximately  8 and 20 for inhalation exposure and i.v. injection, respectively, the ratio for  heroin was approximately 5 regardless of administration route. This pattern of  results suggests that the increase in morphine potency upon inhalation may have  resulted from an increased accessibility to the brain compared with i.v.  injection. Finally, naloxone reversed the antinociceptive effects of volatilized  heroin, but neither the kappa selective antagonist nor-binaltorphimine nor the  delta selective antagonist naltrindole blocked this antinociception, which  suggests the involvement of mu opioid receptors. These findings taken together  suggest the potential for the abuse of a variety of opioids, in addition to  heroin, through the inhalation route of administration by humans.","1996-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","69-76","","1","279","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8858977","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Temperature; Mice, Inbred ICR; Administration, Inhalation; Volatilization; Naloxone/pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Codeine/administration & dosage; Heroin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants  will also be mentioned. Morphine remains the reference compound among centrally  acting analgesics both for acute and chronic pain. Its mechanism of action is  relatively well known as well as the role of opiate receptors. Paracetamol is  largely used as analgesic for relief of slight to moderate pain. Its mechanism of  action still remains unclear. Usually the tolerability of this compound is  considered as being excellent. However overdosage can induce severe and possible  lethal liver necrosis. Aspirin is also a very old and a largely used compound.  Its inhibiting effect on cyclooxygenase acts mainly peripherally but it could  also act centrally. According to the current knowledge of its mechanism of  action, it seems that the main pharmacological properties as well as adverse  events of aspirin are all related to its enzyme inhibiting effect. Slight to  moderate pain, related or not to inflammatory disease responds well to aspirin  and other NSAIDs.","1994-09-15","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1903-1909","","14","44","","Rev Prat","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 7939282","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Pain/*drug therapy; Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use; Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use; *Analgesics; Morphine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Acetaminophen/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior  to the use of homogenized liver, the authors' laboratory had been using mainly  horse liver microsomes for carrying out equine in vitro metabolism studies.  Homogenized horse liver has shown significant advantages over liver microsomes  for in vitro metabolism studies as the procedures are much quicker and have  higher capability for generating more in vitro metabolites. In this study, the  use of homogenized liver has been extended to the generation of phase II in vitro  metabolites (glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates) using 17β-estradiol,  morphine, and boldenone undecylenate as model substrates. It was observed that  phase II metabolites could also be generated even without the addition of  cofactors. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the successful  use of homogenized horse liver for the generation of phase II metabolites. It  also demonstrates the ease with which both phase I and phase II metabolites can  now be generated in vitro simply by using homogenized liver without the need for  ultracentrifuges or tedious preparation steps.","2016-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:46:01","","241-247","","2","8","","Drug Test Anal","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","tex.ids= Wong2016a PMID: 26352508 place: England","","","","Animals; metabolism; Biotransformation; Mass Spectrometry; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Indicators and Reagents; in vitro; Horses; Glucuronides/metabolism; glucuronidation; Microsomes, Liver/chemistry/metabolism; Sulfates/metabolism; Estradiol/metabolism; Morphine/metabolism; horse liver; Liver/*chemistry/metabolism; sulfation; Testosterone/analogs & derivatives/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High doses of intrathecal bupivacaine (75 micrograms) or lidocaine  (500 micrograms) produced motor block and hypotension (150 micrograms  bupivacaine) lasting approximately 15 and 7 min, respectively, whereas low doses  of intrathecal bupivacaine (25 micrograms) and lidocaine (100 micrograms)  produced only a transient motor weakness lasting 2 min or less. Alone, neither  agent altered the hot plate or paw pressure response at doses, or at times, where  the agents had no effect upon motor function. In contrast, at the low dose of  either local anesthetic, after the resolution of the transient motor weakness,  these doses resulted in a significant leftward shift in the dose-response curves  for intrathecal morphine on both the hot plate and paw pressure, as measured by  the maximum observed peak effect and by the area under the time-effect curve.  Thus, for example, the morphine ED50 (95% confidence intervals) for  morphine/saline was 1.7 micrograms (0.7-1.9) on the hot plate and 1.1 micrograms  (0.8-1.4) on the paw pressure versus for morphine/bupivacaine (25 micrograms):  hot plate 0.25 micrograms (0.21-0.42) and paw pressure 0.28 micrograms (0.2-0.4).  Intrathecal morphine was not observed to have any effect on the dose-dependent  effects of intrathecal bupivacaine on motor or autonomic blockade. Comparable  results were also observed with lidocaine (bupivacaine was found to have no  significant effect on spinal cord morphine clearance). We conclude that low doses  of intrathecal lidocaine and bupivacaine, which alone have no antinociceptive  effect, at times when motor function was clearly unimpaired, are able to  significantly augment the antinociceptive activity of intrathecal morphine on the  hot plate and paw pressure tests. This prominent and selective potentiation  appears to occur via a non-pharmacokinetic mechanism and probably reflects upon  the interaction of low concentrations of local anesthetics with systems in the  spinal dorsal horn that process acute high threshold afferent input.","1992-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1186-2000","","6","77","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1466469","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drug Synergism; Injections, Spinal; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Lidocaine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Bupivacaine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Nociceptors/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphine-induced  (10(-6) M) decreases in 45Ca++ uptake were reversed by simultaneous 5-min  incubation of synaptosomes with CGRP (10(-6) M) and were enhanced by a 1-hr  preincubation of the synaptosomes with CGRP (10(-6) M). CGRP produced  naloxone-reversible antinociception in both the p-phenylquinone and hot-plate  tests at 1 hr after i.c.v. administration, a time which corresponds to the peak  CGRP-induced decrease in 45Ca++ uptake. CGRP (0.02 microgram through 40  micrograms i.c.v.) failed to produce antinociception in the tail-flick test.

Naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal syndrome was attenuated in mice after  systemic subacute administration (7 days, 1.2 mmol/kg, sc) of D-phe derivatives,  the development of tolerance to morphine being unchanged.

METHODS: Sixteen subjects of either sex received 0.4  mg/kg (n = 8) or 0.6 mg/kg M6G (n = 8). At regular time intervals, the isocapnic  acute hypoxic ventilatory response, pain tolerance (derived from a transcutaneous  electrical acute pain model), and arterial blood samples were obtained. Data  acquisition continued for 14 h after drug infusion. Population  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic sigmoid Emax models were applied to the  respiratory and pain data. All collected data were analyzed using the statistical  program NONMEM (San Francisco, CA). RESULTS: Four of the subjects were  OPRM1:c.118GA heterozygotes, and the remainder of the subjects were OPRM1:c.118AA  homozygotes. M6G analgesia: In contrast to analgesic responses in OPRM1:c.118AA  homozygotes, responses were small and inconsistent in OPRM1:c.118GA heterozygotes  and best described by the function Effect(t) = baseline (P < 0.01 vs.  OPRM1:c.118AA homozygotes). Emax and C50 values in heterozygotes equaled 0.55 +/-  0.18 (or a 55% increase in current above baseline) and 161 +/- 42 ng/ml,  respectively. M6G-induced respiratory depression: For the acute hypoxic response,  neither Emax nor C50 (value = 282 +/- 72 ng/ml) differed between genotypes.  CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the OPRM1:c.118A>G polymorphism affects  opioid analgesic and respiratory effects differentially. Despite reduced  analgesic responses to M6G the OPRM1:c.118A>G single-nucleotide polymorphism does  not protect against the toxic effects of the tested opioid. However, some caution  in the interpretation of the data is needed because of the small sample size.  Further studies are needed to explore the link between this polymorphism and  respiratory/analgesic responses beyond the small human sample. In OPRM1:c.118AA  homozygotes, the potency parameters differed by a factor of 2 for analgesic  versus respiratory effect. In this respect, M6G differs favorably from morphine.","2005-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","522-530","","3","102","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15731588","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; *Polymorphism, Genetic; Respiration/*drug effects; Analgesia; Receptors, Opioid, mu/*genetics; Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects/pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This in turn appears to greatly reduce the amount of corticosterone available to  intracellular receptors. In the study reported here, we found that in contrast to  the effect in males, morphine has no apparent effect on CBG in females. This  pronounced sex difference does not appear to be attributable to differences in  morphine pharmacokinetics, short-term actions of gonadal hormones in adulthood or  sex differences in CBG or corticosterone levels. In any case, it is evident that  morphine does not decrease the level of physiologically active corticosterone  through CBG in females as it appears to do in males. On the other hand, we also  found a distinct sex difference with regard to the effects of morphine on  corticosterone. Chronic exposure to morphine had no apparent effect on  corticosterone levels in males but resulted in markedly lower levels in females.

The  aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the use of opioids  in patients with cancer with hepatic impairment. METHODS: A systematic review was  conducted and the following databases searched: AMED (-2021), MEDLINE (-2021),  EMBASECLASSIC + EMBASE (-2021) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (-2021). Eligible studies met the following criteria: patients with  cancer-related pain, taking an opioid (as defined by the WHO Guidelines for the  pharmacological and radiotherapeutic management of cancer pain in adults and  adolescents); >18 years of age; patients with hepatic impairment defined using  recognised or study-defined definitions; clinical outcome hepatic impairment  related; and primary studies. All eligible studies were appraised using the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.  RESULTS: Three studies (n=95) were eligible but heterogeneity meant meta-analysis  was not possible. Each individual study focused on only one each of  oxycodone±hydrocotarnine, oxycodone/naloxone and morphine. No recommendations  could be formulated on the preferred opioid in patients with hepatic impairment.  CONCLUSIONS: Morphine is the preferred opioid in hepatic impairment owing to  clinical experience and pharmacokinetics. This review, however, found little  clinical evidence to support this. Dose adjustments of morphine and the oxycodone  formulations reviewed remain necessary in the absence of quality evidence.  Overall, the quality of existing evidence on opioid treatments in cancer pain and  hepatic impairment is low and there remains a need for high-quality clinical  studies examining this.","2022-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","152-157","","2","12","","BMJ Support Palliat Care","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

In this paper, the rat brain endothelial 4 (RBE4) cell monolayer  incubated with astrocyte-conditioned medium was used as an in vitro model of the  BBB to investigate the effects of cholate (C), 12-monoketocholate (MKC),  deoxycholate (DC), and taurocholate (TC) on the transport of the hydrophilic  drug, morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). C, MKC, and TC at a concentration of 5 mM  each and DC at 1 mM increased the permeability of M6G through the paracellular  pathway based on a similar permeability pattern to that of sucrose. RBE4 cell  uptake of M6G was unaffected by 5 mM C and TC, whereas 1 mM DC dramatically  increased it due to an effect shown to be cytotoxicity as measured by the  3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium  assay. Surprisingly, 1 mM MKC significantly increased M6G uptake without any  cytotoxicity. In summary, all bile salts increased paracellular permeation of M6G  but MKC also enhanced transcellular transport with little cytotoxicity. MKC  appears to have the potential to modulate biophysical properties of the cell  membrane or membrane-bound transporters and may therefore enhance drug delivery  to the brain.","2011-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:44:36","","1516-1524","","4","100","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","","","","","tex.ids= Yang2011a PMID: 24081474 place: United States","","","","Animals; Rats; Cell Line; Permeability; Endothelial Cells/metabolism; astrocyte; Blood-Brain Barrier/*metabolism; Bile Acids and Salts/*metabolism; Pharmaceutical Vehicles/*metabolism; blood-brain barrier; Brain/cytology; M6G; bile salt; Morphine Derivatives/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; RBE4 cell; transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different factors have been shown or suspected to affect the safety and efficacy  of codeine treatment. The objective of the current study is to assess and  quantify the impact of important pharmacokinetic factors, using a mechanistic  modeling approach. METHODS: By means of a generic modeling approach integrating  prior physiologic knowledge, we systematically investigated the complex  dependence of opioid exposure on cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4 (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4),  and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7) activity, as well as  renal function, by means of a virtual clinical trial. RESULTS: First, the known  dominant role of CYP2D6 activity for morphine exposure was reproduced. Second,  the model demonstrated that mild and moderate renal impairment and  co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors have only minor influences on opioid  exposure. Third, the model showed - in contrast to current opinion - that  increased UGT2B7 activity is associated with a decrease in active opioid  exposure.

Unfortunately, the supportive evidence basis for the use of these strategies and  specific drug combinations is generally lacking and unclear, with many  medications being used for off-label indications. OBJECTIVE: In this manuscript,  we provide a robust exploration and analysis of the literature to provide an  evidence-based narrative for the use of CIDT strategies in regard to clinical  indications, pharmacologic parameters, specific drug combinations, safety  profiles, and future directions. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review. METHODS: This  was an evidence based narrative performed after extensive review of the  literature. RESULTS: Variances in intrathecal pharmacokinetics and  pharmacodynamics are utilized advantageously with CIDT strategies to achieve  improved analgesic benefit; however, appropriate use may be limited by increased  or compounded risk of adverse effects. The supportive evidence for CIDT use for  chronic pain conditions is largely lacking and limited to small, uncontrolled,  observational studies, with many having various confounding factors, including a  lack of standardized dosing. The most evidenced CIDT strategies include  polyanalgesia with morphine-ziconotide, opioid-clonidine, and  morphine-bupivacaine. Notably, in addition to pain relief, morphine-bupivacaine  has been shown to decrease early opioid escalation requirements. LIMITATIONS: The  supportive evidence for CIDT use for chronic pain conditions is largely lacking  and limited to small, uncontrolled, observational studies, with many having  various confounding factors including a lack of standardized dosing. CONCLUSIONS:  CIDT strategies and polyanalgesia combinations can be effective for treating  various patient populations with chronic pain. The appropriate use of these  strategies may be limited by increased or compounded risk of adverse effects,  both of which are highly patient and scenario dependent. Therefore, practitioners  should maintain a particularly low threshold of suspicion for adverse effects in  patients with CIDT such that safety profiles associated with this therapy can be  favorably maintained.","2021-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","549-569","","8","24","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34793643","","","","Humans; Drug Therapy, Combination; Injections, Spinal; Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use; clonidine; morphine; Morphine/therapeutic use; chronic pain; *Pain Management; Intrathecal; *Chronic Pain/drug therapy; bupivacaine; polyanalgesia; ziconotide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SKP was compared with racemic ketoprofen tromethamine  salt (rac-KP), R(-)-ketoprofen tromethamine salt (RKP), ketorolac (KET), and  morphine (MOR). We also assessed the effects of flurbiprofen (rac-FB) and its  enantiomers (SFB and RFB) in the same model. Groups of six rats received either  vehicle or analgesic drug and antinociception was evaluated by evaluating the  dose-response curves over time. SKP was an effective antinociceptive drug in this  model and was almost equally potent by either oral or intracerebroventricular  administration. The oral potency of SKP was similar to that of oral KET and  greater than that of oral MOR. No significant differences were observed between  racemic ketoprofen and its enantiomers when administered orally. In the rat,  significant bioinversion of RKP to SKP occurs when RKP is given orally. After  oral administration of RKP, SKP was detectable in 30 min and surpassed the  concentration of RKP after 3 h. Nevertheless, when the compounds were given  intracerebroventricularly, some stereoselectivity in favor of SKP was observed.  Stereoselectivity was observed with flurbiprofen, an analogue of ketoprofen that  does not undergo significant metabolic inversion.

This study was designed to determine the utility function of oliceridine  versus morphine based on neurocognitive tests and cold pressor test. METHODS: The  study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial block three-way  crossover design. Experiments were performed in 20 male and female volunteers.  The subjects received intravenous oliceridine (1 or 3 mg; cohorts of 10  subjects/dose), morphine (5 or 10 mg; cohorts of 10 subjects/dose), or placebo on  three separate occasions. Before and after dosing, neurocognitive tests, cold  pressor test, and plasma drug concentrations were obtained at regular intervals.  Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses served as the basis for  construction of a utility function, which is an objective function of probability  of benefit minus probability of harm. Antinociception served as the measure of  benefit, and slowing of saccadic peak velocity and increased body sway as the  measures of neurocognitive harm. RESULTS: The oliceridine and morphine C50  values, i.e., the effect-site concentrations causing 50% effect, were as follows:  antinociception, 13 ± 2 and 23 ± 7 ng/ml; saccadic peak velocity, 90 ± 14 and  54 ± 15 ng/ml; and body sway, 10 ± 2 and 5.6 ± 0.8 ng/ml, respectively. The ratio  oliceridine/morphine of the therapeutic indices, C50(benefit)/C50(harm), were  0.34 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.7; P < 0.01) for saccadic peak velocity and 0.33 (0.16 to  0.50; P < 0.01) for body sway. The oliceridine utility was positive across the  effect-site concentration 5 to 77 ng/ml, indicative of a greater probability of  benefit than harm. The morphine utility was not significantly different from 0  from 0 to 100 ng/ml. Over the concentration range 15 to 50 ng/ml, the oliceridine  utility was superior to that of morphine (P < 0.01). Similar observations were  made for body sway. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that over the clinical  concentration range, oliceridine is an analgesic with a favorable safety profile  over morphine when considering analgesia and neurocognitive function.","2023-12-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","746-756","","6","139","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 American Society of Anesthesiologists.

The apparent stimulatory effect of spermine was decreased remarkably by  the simultaneous addition of EDTA to inhibit lipid peroxidation. Similar results  were observed when an additional lipid peroxidation inhibitor such as Co2+, Mn2+  or 2,2'-bipyridine was used in place of EDTA. Hydrogen peroxide-dependent  ethylmorphine N-demethylation activity in rat liver microsomes was not influenced  by the addition of spermine. In addition, neither lipid peroxides formation nor  the stimulatory effects of polyamines on ethylmorphine N-demethylation was  observed in the reconstituted monooxygenase system.

The role of the  endogenous mu-opioid receptor (MOP) system in pain-negative affect interactions  and the influence of genetic background thereon are poorly understood. The inbred  Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat, which mimics aspects of anxiety and depression, displays  increased sensitivity (hyperalgesia) to noxious stimuli, compared with  Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Here, we report that WKY rats are hyporesponsive to the  antinociceptive effects of systemically administered MOP agonist morphine in the  hot plate and formalin tests, compared with SD counterparts. Equivalent plasma  morphine levels in the 2 rat strains suggested that these differences in morphine  sensitivity were unlikely to be due to strain-related differences in morphine  pharmacokinetics. Although MOP expression in the ventrolateral periaqueductal  gray (vlPAG) did not differ between WKY and SD rats, the vlPAG was identified as  a key locus for the hyporesponsivity to MOP agonism in WKY rats in the formalin  test. Moreover, morphine-induced effects on c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activity)  in regions downstream of the vlPAG, namely, the rostral ventromedial medulla and  lumbar spinal dorsal horn, were blunted in the WKY rats. Together, these findings  suggest that a deficit in the MOP-induced recruitment of the descending  inhibitory pain pathway may underlie hyperalgesia to noxious inflammatory pain in  the WKY rat strain genetically predisposed to negative affect.","2021-02-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","405-420","","2","162","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 International Association for the Study of Pain.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32826755","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rats, Inbred WKY; Morphine/therapeutic use; *Nociception; *Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use; Periaqueductal Gray","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined the possibility that this diarrhea results in part  from alterations in intestinal fluid transport. Isolated loops of jejunum, ileum  and colon were created in morphine-dependent and nondependent rats implanted s.c.  with morphine or lactose pellets, respectively. The administration of naltrexone  (1 mg/kg s.c.) or its quaternary analog methylnaltrexone (0.01-3 mg/kg i.v.),  which does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, produced a dose-related  reduction in fluid absorption from the jejunum and colon of dependent animals  only. Similar effects were observed after the i.c.v. injection of quaternary  naltrexone (1.0-10 microgram/rat). Both narcotic antagonists, given by any route,  produced no change in ileal absorption. Pretreatment with hexamethonium (10 mg/kg  i.v.) or atropine (4 mg/kg i.v.) attenuated the antiabsorptive effects of  quaternary naltrexone on the jejunum. Serosal addition of naltrexone (10 microM)  had no effect on Na or Cl fluxes, short-circuit current or tissue conductance  across isolated segments of intestinal mucosa from dependent and nondependent  rats. These results indicate that precipitated opiate withdrawal is associated  with decreases in jejunal and colonic fluid absorption mediated at sites within  both the central nervous system and periphery. Moreover, these effects are not a  consequence of a direct opiate action on enterocytes.","1984-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","364-369","","2","228","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6607339","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew; Biological Transport/drug effects; Intestinal Absorption/*drug effects; Water-Electrolyte Balance/drug effects; Gastrointestinal Motility/drug effects; Atropine/pharmacology; Morphine/*adverse effects; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*etiology; Diarrhea/*chemically induced; Hexamethonium Compounds/pharmacology; Morphine Dependence/drug therapy; Naltrexone/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effectiveness of methylnaltrexone in preventing  morphine-induced changes in gastrointestinal motility and transit without  affecting analgesia was evaluated in humans. Twelve healthy volunteers were given  intravenous placebo, placebo plus 0.05 mg/kg morphine, or 0.45 mg/kg  methylnaltrexone plus 0.05 mg/kg morphine. Oral-cecal transit time was assessed  by the pulmonary hydrogen measurement technique, and analgesia was measured with  use of the cold-pressor test. Morphine significantly increased oral-cecal transit  time from 104.6 +/- 31.1 minutes (mean +/- SD) to 163.3 +/- 39.8 minutes (p <  0.01). Methylnaltrexone prevented 97% of morphine-induced increase in oral-cecal  transit time (106.3 +/- 39.8 minutes; not significant compared with baseline; p <  0.01 compared with morphine alone). Methylnaltrexone did not affect the analgesic  effect of morphine on both pain intensity and pain bothersomeness ratings. At a  higher dose of morphine (0.1 mg/kg), our preliminary results indicated that 0.45  mg/kg methylnaltrexone also prevented the morphine-induced delay in oral-cecal  transit time, with no effect on analgesia.

Opioid bolus dosing can be  used with a minimal continuous infusion or it can function as the sole therapy.  Bolus-only dosing is characterized by minimal use of opioid (often less than 1 mg  of IT morphine). It achieves adequate pain control while reducing tolerance and  possibly opioid-induced hyperalgesia. It may prevent receptor saturation, and  provide a ""washing out"" of the opioid receptor that prevents the observed dose  escalation resulting from continuous infusions. With new bolus dosing  possibilities, IT pumps can be used earlier in the treatment algorithm instead of  being a late-stage treatment for patients who responded poorly to conservative  treatments. We hypothesize that morphine bolus-only IT dosing will have  comparable adverse effect rates, and possibly increased safety as compared to the  more conservative continuous delivery method. We further predict that bolus-only  delivery will provide better therapy satisfaction, improved functional scores,  lower 24 hour opioid dose, and less dose escalation.","2017-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","E601-E603","","4","20","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28535569","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Pain/*drug therapy; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Receptors, Opioid/drug effects/physiology; *Injections, Spinal; Cerebrospinal Fluid/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to morphine  self-administration, rats rapidly acquired cocaine self-administration behavior  at either the 0.3 or 0.56 injection dose and showed typical inverted U-shaped  dose-response curves with maximal responding occurring at the injection dose of  0.3 mg/kg. With the ""yoked"" pairs of subjects, the rate of responding of the  animal actually self-administering the drug was significantly higher than that of  a paired animal which passively received injection whenever the first animal  self-administered the drug. Thus, both morphine and cocaine served as a positive  reinforcer of self-administration behavior under the fixed ratio 5 schedule of  reinforcement. However, the 0.56 mg/kg injection dose of morphine resulted in an  acquisition curve that was markedly, temporally delayed relative to the injection  dose of cocaine. Finally, cocaine maintained higher rates of responding for its  delivery than morphine. These differences between self-administration patterns of  morphine and cocaine may provide significant information about the nature of drug  reinforcement and dependence.","2003-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","713-726","","5","55","","Pol J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 14704467","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Intravenous; Infusions, Intravenous; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Reinforcement Schedule; Reinforcement, Psychology; Morphine Dependence; *Self Administration; Behavior, Animal/drug effects/physiology; Cocaine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Conditioning, Operant/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results  demonstrated the majority of drug loss was due to adsorption by the PVC tubing.  The purpose of this study was to determine if a tubing coating process affects  fentanyl or morphine Sulfate adsorption. The goal was to quantify fentanyl or  morphine sulfate lost due to adhesion within surface modified tubing. The  following surface modifications were studied: 1) Maquet Safeline (synthetic  immobilized albumin); 2) Maquet Softline (a heparin free biopassive polymer); 3)  Maquet Bioline (recombinant human albumin + heparin) (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG,  Hirrlingen, Germany); 4) Terumo X Coating (poly2methoxylacrylate)) (Terumo  Cardiovascular Systems Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI); 5) Medtronic Carmeda  (covalently bonded heparin); and 6) Medtronic Trillium (covalently bonded  heparin) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). A total of 36 individual circuits were  built from the above six available modified surface coatings, for a total of six  individual circuits of each coating type. Blood samples were drawn at 5 minutes,  120 minutes, and 360 minutes followed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  to determine available circulating levels of either fentanyl or morphine sulfate.  Fentanyl concentrations decreased to an average final available concentration of  35% (+/- 5%) within the 18 circuits.

In confirmation of previous work, electrical  stimulation of the PGi in opioid-nai;ve rats induced stimulus-intensity-related,  withdrawal-like behaviors similar to those observed during naloxone-precipitated  withdrawal from dependence upon butorphanol. Novel findings were made in rats  surgically implanted with cannulae aimed at the lateral ventricle and the right  PGi and made physically dependent by intracerebroventricular infusion of either  morphine (26 nmol/microl/h) or butorphanol (26 nmol/microl/h) through an osmotic  minipump for 3 days. Two hours following termination of the opioid infusion,  microinjections of naloxone (11 nmol/400 nl), a nonselective opioid receptor  antagonist, or nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) (3.84 nmol/400 nl), a selective  kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, were made into the PGi of morphine-dependent  and butorphanol-dependent rats. Discrete PGi injections precipitated withdrawal  behaviors, with significant (P<.05) increases noted in the incidence of teeth  chattering, wet-dog shakes, and scratching. Composite scores for behavioral  withdrawal were significantly higher in nor-BNI-precipitated,  butorphanol-dependent rats (score=6.8+/-0.6), in naloxone-precipitated,  butorphanol-dependent rats (8.9+/-0.8), and in naloxone-precipitated,  morphine-dependent rats (11.5+/-0.9) than in all other groups. Both kappa- and  mu-opioid receptor mediated dependence can be demonstrated at the level of a  discrete medullary site, the PGi, which further supports a specific role for this  nucleus in elicitation of behavioral responses during opioid withdrawal.","2002-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","241-252","","1","74","","Pharmacol Biochem Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12376173","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Diffusion; Microinjections; Electric Stimulation; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*physiopathology; Morphine Dependence/*physiopathology; Butorphanol/pharmacology; Basal Ganglia/*physiopathology; Morphine/*adverse effects/pharmacology; Naloxone/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Naltrexone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Narcotics/*adverse effects/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, kappa/drug effects/*physiology; Stereotaxic Techniques; Stereotyped Behavior/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

B.","Contributions of neuropharmacology to understanding mechanisms of tolerance and dependence.","NIDA research monograph","","1046-9516","","","In summary, many of our once generally accepted ideas about tolerance and dependence have been revised as the result of neuropharmacological research.  Included among these concepts are the following: Although tolerance and  dependence are usually linked, they appear to be separable phenomena in some  instances. Further exploration into each should be profitable. Although chronic  administration of a drug is usually required to produce tolerance and dependence,  even a single dose can result in these effects under certain conditions. That  fact may provide us with clues as to the neuroadaptive changes occurring during  the development of tolerance and dependence. A fruitful line of research emanates  from the findings that tolerance may be pharmacokinetic or neuronal and that time  of receptor occupancy appears to be a vital factor in neuronal tolerance. It is  now known that tolerance does not develop equally to all actions of a drug and  reverse tolerance (increased responsiveness) can occur. Further studies along  these lines are needed to correct many false assumptions about this issue and to  shed new light on the receptors and transmitter systems involved. We now accept  the notion that a drug usually exerts effects on more than one receptor type or  subtype. Consequently, the actions of drugs on the various receptors and the  responses to receptor blockade promise to yield significant new knowledge about  the mechanisms involved in tolerance and dependence to a wide variety of drugs.  We have become increasingly aware of species differences and genetic determinants  of responses to drugs of abuse, after both acute and chronic dosing. Other papers  in this volume will focus on this topic.","1984","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","27-38","","","54","","NIDA Res Monogr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6442759","","","","Humans; Animals; Reaction Time/drug effects; Seizures/physiopathology; Body Temperature/drug effects; *Pharmacology; *Drug Tolerance; Morphine/blood/pharmacology; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/physiopathology; Amphetamine/pharmacology; Narcotics/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Substance-Related Disorders/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We now present evidence strongly implying that heroin and two  potent mu drugs, fentanyl and etonitazine, act through a unique receptor  mechanism similar to morphine-6 beta-glucuronide which is readily distinguished  from morphine. Heroin, 6-acetylmorphine and morphine-6 beta-glucuronide show no  analgesic cross tolerance to morphine in a daily administration paradigm,  implying distinct receptors. Strains also reveal analgesic differences among the  drugs. CXBK mice, which are insensitive to morphine, retain their analgesic  sensitivity to heroin, 6-acetylmorphine, morphine-6 beta-glucuronide, fentanyl  and etonitazine. Antisense mapping of the mu opioid receptor MOR-1 reveals that  oligodeoxynucleotide probes against exon 2, which are inactive against morphine  analgesia, block morphine-6 beta-glucuronide, heroin, fentanyl and etonitazine  analgesia. Finally, an antisense probe targeting Gi alpha 1 blocks both heroin  and morphine-6 beta-glucuronide, but not morphine, analgesia. These results  indicate that heroin, 6-acetylmorphine, fentanyl and etonitazine all can produce  analgesia through a novel mu analgesic system which is similar to that activated  by morphine-6 beta-glucuronide.","1996-09-20","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1-4","","1","216","","Neurosci Lett","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 8892377","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Species Specificity; Drug Tolerance; Down-Regulation/physiology; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Analgesics/pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Enkephalins/pharmacology; Heroin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, mu/drug effects/physiology; Receptors, Opioid/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twelve patients with pain secondary to cancer were simultaneously  administered both morphine (10 mg) and pethidine (50 mg) in 10 ml of normal  saline via an epidural catheter inserted in the lumbar region (usually L2,3) and  attached to a subcutaneously implanted portal reservoir.

There was a rapid  vascular uptake of morphine from the epidural space with a mean (+/- S.D.) peak  concentration of 173 +/- 80 ng/ml (range 52-345 ng/ml) and a time-to-peak  concentration of 8 +/- 6 min (range 2-17 min). In contrast, the vascular uptake  of pethidine was more variable with a mean (+/- S.D.) concentration of 274 +/-  294 ng/ml (range 80-1113 ng/ml) and the time-to-peak concentration was 21 +/- 26  min (range 2-75 min). There was a rapid absorption of pethidine across the dura  mater into the CSF with peak CSF concentrations between 1400 and 1650 ng/ml  occurring between 10 and 60 min in samples collected cephalad (C7-T1 interspace)  from the administration point in the lumbar region.

This  retrospective study aimed to analyze any improvement in the ability of  sufentanyl, a highly lipophilic opioid, and morphine, a poorly lipophilic opioid,  to control postoperative pain at rest and in motion when combined with  ropivacaine 0.2%. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 171 patients who  underwent major abdominal or urological surgery were evaluated. The therapeutic  protocol provided for continuous epidural perfusion (5 mL/h) of ropivacaine 0.2%  + morphine 0.03 mg/mL or ropivacaine 0.2% + sufentanyl 0.75 mug/mL for 48 h. Pain  at rest (numeric rate scale, NRS) and in motion (NRSm) was evaluated by means of  the NRS upon waking and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hs, providing for the  administration of a rescue dose if NRS >4. The overall analgesic effect was  evaluated by comparing the area under the NRS curve (AUC) of both treatments  using the Mann Whitney U test. Any differences between treatments in terms of NRS  and NRSm in time were evaluated using ordinal logistic regression. To compare the  frequency of patients who reported NRS >4 at least once during the follow-up  period, logistic regression was used. Finally, the frequency of patients who  required at least one additional drug or reported side effects was compared using  Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: While both groups showed a comparable overall  analgesic effect, the baseline values of NRS and NRSm were lower for the  sufentanyl group (P<0.001), perhaps as a result of its quicker onset due to  higher lipophilicity. No statistically significant difference was observed in the  frequency of patients requiring administration of an additional analgesic drug  (P=0.136) or in the incidence of complications (P=0.799). CONCLUSION: Both  protocols providing a combination of a local anaesthetic and an opioid  demonstrated an excellent safety and efficacy profile. The differing  lipophilicity of the opioids did not cause any clinically or statistically  significant differences in terms of efficacy or safety, other than a reduced  onset time of sufentanyl, ensuring better pain control upon waking. We therefore  believe that morphine should be the standard opioid for neuraxial use, although  these results must be confirmed in the setting of a randomized controlled  clinical trial.","2008-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","69-76","","3","74","","Minerva Anestesiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 18288069","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Pain, Postoperative/*prevention & control; Abdomen/*surgery; Analgesia, Epidural/*methods; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Sufentanil/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Urologic Diseases/*surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  assessment was carried out through isobolographic analysis relative to ED(50)s of  both morphine and tadalafil obtained by tail-flick test on BALB/c mice. Morphine  and tadalafil ED(50)s calculated from the dose-response curves were 8303 and 2080  μg/kg, respectively. The experimental ED(50) values of morphine and tadalafil in  their mixture were 4800 and 1210 μg/kg, respectively. Those results showed an  additive interaction between morphine and tadalafil presented by a total fraction  value for the mixture of 1160 μg/kg. This outcome can be interpreted by the fact  that both drugs share common pathways, namely, NO-cGMP and opioid receptors. As a  conclusion, the morphine and tadalafil combination showed an additive effect  against acute pain, which is mediated through the central nervous system, thus  providing a rationale for combining them to decrease morphine dose and thus  minimizing its side effects.","2020-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","771-776","","11","98","","Can J Physiol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 32516551","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Drug Synergism; Mice; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Disease Models, Animal; drug interaction; Pain Measurement; Analgesia/*methods; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Drug Therapy, Combination/methods; nitric oxide; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; analgesia; morphine; analgésie; antinociception; étude isobolographique; inhibiteur de la phosphodiestérase 5; interaction médicamenteuse; isobolographic analysis; oxyde nitrique; Pain/diagnosis/*drug therapy; phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor; tadalafil; Tadalafil/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The levels of peptides were  determined by specific radioimmunoassays after separation by high-pressure liquid  chromatography. It was found that exposure to morphine did not affect the  disappearance of beta E, but altered the time course of accumulation of beta E  fragments. In fact, the accumulation of gamma-endorphin, alpha-endorphin and  des-tyrosine1-alpha-endorphin was enhanced, while that of  des-tyrosine1-gamma-endorphin was not change. Additionally, the disappearance of  gamma-endorphin appeared to be stimulated by morphine exposure.

A NSAID for postoperative pain: no proven advantage.","Prescrire international","","1167-7422","","","(1) Parecoxib is the second nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, after ketoprofen, to be marketed in France for the treatment of postoperative pain. (2) Another  injectable NSAID, ketorolac, was marketed briefly in the 1990s. It was shown to  be no more effective than ketoprofen, but was withdrawn from the French market  because it provoked bleeding. (3) The clinical evaluation dossier on parecoxib  contains no data from comparative trials with ketoprofen. The three trials versus  ketorolac failed to show that parecoxib was more effective. (4) The two trials  comparing parecoxib with morphine are biased by the use of a too low dose of  morphine (4 mg). Four trials show that adding parecoxib reduces morphine  requirements in patients injecting the opiate on demand. There is no evidence  that this reduction translates into a lower risk of adverse reactions to opiates.  (5) Parecoxib is marketed as ""Cox-2-specific inhibitor"", but follow-up is too  short to show whether this property avoids the severe adverse effects seen with  other NSAIDs, such as renal failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and delayed  wound healing. Parecoxib, like its principal metabolite valdecoxib, can cause  severe hypersensitivity reactions. (6) Parecoxib is 10 times more expensive than  injectable ketoprofen in France. (7) In practice, ketoprofen is still the best  choice for parenteral NSAID-based pain relief in the postoperative setting.","2004-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","83-85","","71","13","","Prescrire Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 15233140","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Follow-Up Studies; Europe; United States; Drug Approval; Canada; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy; Morphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Isoxazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, it is a common  observation that fatal cases of heroin-intoxication with blood morphine  concentrations lower than 100 ng/ml occur. This poses the question of how the  fatal cases with low blood morphine concentrations can be explained. In the study  described here, 62 cases of morphine only intoxications were examined. The fatal  cases were divided into two groups according to the free morphine concentrations  measured in the blood of the heart (group I: free morphine concentration < 100  ng/ml, n = 21 cases; group II: free morphine concentration > or = 100 ng/ml, n =  41 cases).

Most adverse events were mild, with numerically lower absolute number of  adverse events reported with ASP8062 plus morphine versus placebo plus morphine.  ASP8062 plus morphine did not increase respiratory depression, potential drug  abuse- or withdrawal-related adverse events. There were no significant PK  interactions. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 1 study, we did not observe any  unexpected safety signals or notable PK interactions with concomitant morphine  administration. These data suggest a potentially low risk for an increase in drug  abuse- or withdrawal-related adverse events or respiratory distress in  participants exposed to ASP8062 and morphine.","2023-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","449-461","","5","37","","J Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37125424","","","","Humans; Double-Blind Method; Morphine/adverse effects; *Analgesics, Opioid; respiratory depression; *Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy; GABAB receptor; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Opioid use; positive allosteric modulator; Receptors, GABA-B","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Liposome-encapsulated morphine was produced,  using a standard technique These preparations were tested in an animal model of  neuropathic pain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (approx. 300 g) were allotted to  control (non-loaded liposomes) and treatment (liposome-encapsulated oxymorphone  or morphine) groups. Drugs were administered subcutaneously to all rats  immediately prior to sciatic nerve ligation. Thermal withdrawal latencies were  measured at baseline and daily for seven days after sciatic nerve ligation. A  second experiment involved subcutaneous administration of non-loaded liposomes,  morphine, or oxymorphone to rats that did not undergo sciatic nerve ligation.  Thermal withdrawal latencies in sciatic nerve-ligated rats given non-loaded  liposomes decreased significantly by day four, with maximal decrease at day seven  after surgery, indicating development of full hyperalgesia. In contrast, ligated  rats given liposome-encapsulated morphine or liposome-encapsulated oxymorphone  had no decrease in thermal withdrawal latency by day four, indicating that these  long-acting preparations prevented development of hyperalgesia after a single  injection. This treatment effect persisted to day seven. Non-ligated rats treated  with vehicle or liposome-encapsulated morphine had no change in thermal  withdrawal latencies. Non-ligated rats treated with liposome-encapsulated  oxymorphone had a small, but significant increase in thermal withdrawal latency  from day four through day seven. One subcutaneous injection of  liposome-encapsulated oxymorphone or morphine was effective in preventing  hyperalgesia in this pain model for up to seven days.

In addition, liver disease appears to selectively impair drug  oxidation pathways while leaving glucuronidation preserved. These studies using  isolated perfused rat livers were designed to examine the effects of liver  disease on the hepatic extraction and clearance and intrinsic clearance of  morphine, a glucuronidated drug, and meperidine, an oxidized drug, under  controlled blood flow and drug-binding conditions. We chose chronic carbon  tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis as the liver disease. At a flow rate of 12  ml/min, the extraction of meperidine was reduced from 0.91 +/- 0.02 ml/min in  controls to 0.76 +/- 0.04 ml/min (p < 0.05) in cirrhosis, hepatic clearance was  reduced from 10.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min in controls to 9.15 +/- 0.48 ml/min (p < 0.05)  in cirrhosis and intrinsic hepatic clearance was reduced from 179 +/- 35 ml/min  in controls to 69 +/- 14 ml/min (p < 0.05) in cirrhosis. In contrast, for  morphine we saw no significant changes: extraction ratio, 0.59 +/- 0.02 in  controls and 0.49 +/- 0.04 in cirrhosis; hepatic clearance, 7.02 +/- 0.26 ml/min  in controls and 6.04 +/- 0.42 ml/min in cirrhosis; and hepatic intrinsic  clearance, 15.4 +/- 1.2 ml/min in controls and 13.9 +/- 2.3 ml/min in cirrhosis.

Morphine increased in a concentration dependent manner the  degradation of Leu-enkephalin in cultivated bovine aortic endothelial cells.  Naloxone, a morphine antagonist, did not prevent this effect, but caused it as  well. The enhanced Leu-enkephalin degradation was due to an increase in the  activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), whereas the activity of other  ecto-peptidases (aminopeptidase N and neutral endopeptidase) was not influenced.  Despite a high non-specific binding of [3H]-morphine, no specific opioid receptor  binding on the endothelial cells could be detected. Autoradiographic  investigations with native, cryostat-sectioned cells demonstrated that  [3H]-morphine was nearly exclusively located within the nuclei.

Mu-opioid receptor-like  immunoreactivity was present in 65.6% of cholecystokinin-positive neurons in  laminae I and II of rat spinal cord. Conversely, 40.4% of mu-opioid  receptor-positive neurons contained cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity.  Systemic application of morphine (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg; i.v.) after sciatic nerve  section significantly, but reversibly, decreased mu-Opioid receptor-like  immunoreactivity in the medial half of lamina II in segment L5 of the ipsilateral  dorsal horn, and cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity was also markedly reduced  in the same region.

All drugs were injected intraperitoneally.  Tiagabine was administered to mice 30 min before the analgesic drugs. Measurement  of the reaction to a noxious stimulus was performed 60, 90 and 120 min after  administration of tiagabine. The study was further conducted for 10 days with  repeated drug doses. Tiagabine and morphine administered in single doses  demonstrate an additive antinociceptive effect in the hot-plate test and a  slightly synergistic effect in the tail-flick test.

A  rat tail-withdrawal procedure was used to test the antinociceptive effects of the  mu-opioids etorphine, morphine, and dezocine before and after twice-daily  subcutaneous injections with either 0. 003 mg/kg etorphine, 10 mg/kg morphine, or  3.0 mg/kg dezocine, each administered alone or in combination with 3.0 mg/kg of  the competitive NMDA antagonist LY235959. After chronic etorphine, the etorphine,  morphine, and dezocine curves were shifted rightward 1.0-, 2.2-, and 3.4-fold,  respectively. LY235959 prevented cross-tolerance to morphine and dezocine. After  chronic morphine, the etorphine and morphine curves were shifted rightward 2.5-  and 2. 9-fold, respectively, and the dezocine curve was flattened. LY235959  prevented morphine tolerance and cross-tolerance to etorphine and reduced the  magnitude of cross-tolerance to dezocine. After chronic dezocine, the etorphine,  morphine, and dezocine curves were shifted rightward 4.1-, 3.5-, and 9.6-fold,  respectively. LY235959 did not prevent but reduced the magnitude of tolerance and  cross-tolerance. In a separate experiment, the following rank order of efficacy  was determined from the magnitudes of rightward shift in each dose-effect curve  after administration of 1.0 mg/kg of the irreversible antagonist clocinnamox:  etorphine > morphine > dezocine.

To better understand these aspects of epidural pharmacokinetics, the authors  measured the permeability of morphine and alfentanil through the different  components of the spinal meninges-dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater-of  dogs and monkeys in vitro. Live meningeal tissue from either species (dura mater  alone, pia mater alone, or intact dura-arachnoid-pia) was placed between two  fluid reservoirs of a temperature-controlled diffusion cell. The permeability of  the tissues to each opioid was determined by placing the opioid in one of the  reservoirs of the diffusion cell and measuring the rate at which the drug  diffused through the tissue and appeared in the second reservoir. The arachnoid  mater was found to be the major meningeal diffusion barrier between the epidural  space and the spinal cord. Alfentanil was 3.7 times more permeable than morphine  through all three meninges, suggesting that increased lipid solubility increases  meningeal permeability. However, neither lipid solubility nor molecular weight  adequately explained the difference in permeability between morphine and  alfentanil. The authors conclude that this in vitro model has significant utility  for studies aimed at predicting in vivo meningeal permeability and hence the  potency and rapidity of action of any opioid administered by the epidural route.","1990-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1214-1219","","6","73","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2248398","","","","Male; Female; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Dogs; Permeability; Alfentanil/*pharmacokinetics; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Macaca nemestrina; Dura Mater/*metabolism; *Spinal Cord; Arachnoid/*metabolism; Pia Mater/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No significant differences in levels of microsomal cytochrome  P-450 or NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase were seen between the two groups.  Total hepatic microsomal capacity for glucuronidation of morphine and  hydroxylation of pentobarbital was not altered by elevated hepatic vein pressure  and no change in in vivo systemic clearance was seen for either drug in response  to hepatic venous congestion.

Several studies have used operant behavior to quantify these effects. However,  little research has been done using unconditioned behavior. One objective of this  study was to determine whether opioid agonist pretreatment (e.g., morphine,  fentanyl, and meperidine) potentiated naltrexone-induced suppression of water  consumption following deprivation. Another objective was to determine whether the  agonist pretreatment interval was functionally related to efficacy for the  manifestation of acute dependence. Finally, we compared temporally the effects of  the three agonists. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were water deprived for 18,  20, or 22 h and given an injection (s.c.) of an agonist or saline. After 1.75,  3.75, or 5.75 h, animals received a single dose (s.c.) of naltrexone (0.01-30  mg/kg) or saline. Fifteen minutes later, subjects had access to water for 30 min.  A time course of antinociception was constructed after agonist administration,  using the tail-flick procedure. All three agonists dose dependently potentiated  naltrexone-induced drinking suppression, decreasing the ED50 of naltrexone by as  much as 150-fold. There was no clear relationship between agonist efficacy and  pretreatment interval. Sensitization to naltrexone was seen up to 6 h after  agonist administration, occurring in the apparent absence of an antinociceptive  effect. These data extend the range of behavioral effects of opioid antagonists  potentiated by opioid agonist pretreatment to suppression of drinking and show  that such potentiation can occur in the absence of a prototypical agonist effect.","2001-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","156-164","","1","298","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11408537","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Water Deprivation; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacology; Naltrexone/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Meperidine/pharmacology; Pain Measurement/*drug effects; Fentanyl/pharmacology; Discrimination, Psychological/*drug effects/physiology; Drinking/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors quantified the respiratory effects of oliceridine and  morphine in elderly volunteers. The authors hypothesized that these opioids  differ in their pharmacodynamic behavior, measured as effect on ventilation at an  extrapolated end-tidal Pco2 at 55 mmHg, V̇E55. METHODS: This four-arm  double-blind, randomized, crossover study examined the respiratory effects of  intravenous 0.5 or 2 mg oliceridine and 2 or 8 mg morphine in 18 healthy male and  female volunteers, aged 55 to 89 yr, on four separate occasions. Participants'  CYP2D6 genotypes were determined, hypercapnic ventilatory responses were  obtained, and arterial blood samples were collected before and for 6 h after  treatment. A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed on  V̇E55, the primary endpoint; values reported are median ± standard error of the  estimate. RESULTS: Oliceridine at low dose was devoid of significant respiratory  effects. High-dose oliceridine and both morphine doses caused a rapid onset of  respiratory depression with peak effects occurring at 0.5 to 1 h after opioid  dosing. After peak effect, compared with morphine, respiratory depression induced  by oliceridine returned faster to baseline. The effect-site concentrations  causing a 50% depression of V̇E55 were 29.9 ± 3.5 ng/ml (oliceridine) and 21.5 ±  4.6 ng/ml (morphine), the blood effect-site equilibration half-lives differed by  a factor of 5: oliceridine 44.3 ± 6.1 min and morphine 214 ± 27 min. Three poor  CYP2D6 oliceridine metabolizers exhibited a significant difference in oliceridine  clearance by about 50%, causing higher oliceridine plasma concentrations after  both low- and high-dose oliceridine, compared with the other participants.  CONCLUSIONS: Oliceridine and morphine differ in their respiratory  pharmacodynamics with a more rapid onset and offset of respiratory depression for  oliceridine and a smaller magnitude of respiratory depression over time.","2023-03-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","249-263","","3","138","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023, the American Society of Anesthesiologists.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats  received fixed ratios of clonidine to fentanyl, meperidine or morphine by i.v.  and intrathecal injection. Data are expressed as percentage of maximal possible  effect and the dose producing 50 percentage of maximal possible effect for each  drug or drug combination is used to index potency. The rank order of potency in  both tests after i.v. administration is fentanyl much greater than clonidine  greater than meperidine greater than or equal to morphine and after intrathecal  administration it is morphine greater than fentanyl much greater than clonidine  much greater than meperidine. Isobolographic analysis shows that the effect of  clonidine combined with an opiate is additive after i.v. administration; the  exception is that morphine and clonidine are synergistic in the hot plate test.  The intrathecal combinations of clonidine with morphine or meperidine produces a  supra-additive antinociceptive effect in the tail-flick test but not in the hot  plate test. Fentanyl does so in both tests. These data confirm a positive  interaction between clonidine and opiates in producing antinociception. This  interaction may be additive or synergistic, depending on route of administration  and the nociceptive test used. The timing of injections and pharmacokinetic  factors may also influence the results. Moreover, these results suggest that the  interaction between the opiate and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors occurs within the  spinal cord.","1990-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1107-1116","","3","255","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2262895","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Injections, Intravenous; Drug Therapy, Combination; Injections, Spinal; Hot Temperature; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Clonidine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Nociceptors/*drug effects; Narcotics/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Fentanyl/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Infrared Rays; Meperidine/administration & dosage/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since a prevention  of Ca2+ uptake into the nerve terminals was considered as one of the mechanisms  for morphine analgesia, we examined the effect of A I and morphine on the 45Ca  uptake by rat brain synaptosomal preparations. Morphine of 10(-8)-10(-6) mol/L  produced a dose-related suppression on synaptosomal 45Ca uptake, which was  completely reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone of 10(-6) mol/L. A I of  10(-8)-10(-6) mol/L, on the contrary, enhanced 45Ca uptake. This effect was  totally abolished by saralasin, a A I antagonist, at 10(-6) mol/L. When  synaptosomal preparations were incubated in a mixture of morphine (10(-6) mol/L)  and A I (10(-8)-10(-6) mol/L), the effect of morphine was almost completely  reversed. The results suggest that the distinct effect of A I may account for, at  least in part, the antagonistic effect of A I on morphine analgesia.","1989-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","179-183","","2","41","","Sheng Li Xue Bao","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 2762844","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Brain/metabolism; Calcium/*pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin II/*pharmacology; Synaptosomes/*metabolism; Morphine/*antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In combination with alcohol these drugs lead to an  antabus-like reaction. In respect to the influence of ethanol on the metabolic  degradation of drugs it must be destinguished between acute and chronic effects  of alcohol. Upon acute influence of ethanol we observe an increased efficiency of  many drugs. Chronical influence of ethanol on the other hand leads to a reduced  action of drugs by enzyme inhibition. Besides the interaction on the level of  biotransformation the interaction on the receptor-level is important.

Animal studies indicate that P-glycoprotein limits morphine  entry into the brain. In this study, the authors examined whether other opioids  of importance to anesthesiologists such as fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil,  and also morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide, are P-glycoprotein  substrates and whether, in turn, these opioids act also as P-glycoprotein  inhibitors. METHODS: The transcellular movement of the various opioids, including  loperamide and morphine, was assessed in L-MDR1 (expressing P-glycoprotein) and  LLC-PK1 cell monolayers (P-glycoprotein expression absent). A preferential  basal-to-apical versus apical-to-basal transport in the L-MDR cells but not the  LLC-PK1 cells is seen for P-glycoprotein substrates. In addition, the effect of  the various opioids on the transcellular movement of the prototypical  P-glycoprotein substrate digoxin was examined in Caco-2 cell monolayers. IC50  values were calculated according to the Hill equation. RESULTS: Loperamide was a  substrate showing high dependence on P-glycoprotein in that basal-apical  transport was nearly 10-fold greater than in the apical-basal direction in L-MDRI  cells. Morphine also showed a basal-to-apical gradient in the L-MDR1 cell  monolayer, indicating that it too is a P-glycoprotein substrate, but with less  dependence than loperamide in that only 1.5-fold greater basal-apical directional  transport was observed. Fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil did not behave as  P-glycoprotein substrates, whereas the morphine glucuronides did not cross the  cell monolayers at all, whether P-glycoprotein was present or not. Loperamide,  sufentanil, fentanyl, and alfentanil inhibited P-glycoprotein-mediated digoxin  transport in Caco-2 cells with IC50 values of 2.5, 4.5, 6.5, and 112 microm,  respectively. Morphine and its glucuronides (20 microm) did not inhibit digoxin  (5 microm) transport in Caco-2 cells, and therefore IC50 values were not  determined. CONCLUSIONS: Opioids have a wide spectrum of P-glycoprotein activity,  acting as both substrates and inhibitors, which might contribute to their varying  central nervous system-related effects.","2002-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:51:18","","913-920","","4","96","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Wandel2002a PMID: 11964599 place: United States","","","","Humans; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Cells, Cultured; Analgesics, Opioid/*metabolism; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Morphine/*metabolism/pharmacology; Fentanyl/*metabolism/pharmacology; Alfentanil/*metabolism/pharmacology; Antidiarrheals/*metabolism; Loperamide/*metabolism/pharmacology; Sufentanil/*metabolism/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These  observations have led to the hypothesis that EOP-containing neuronal systems may  be involved in the onset of puberty. To examine this possibility, rats were  challenged with naloxone and morphine, as probes to decrease or exaggerate,  respectively, the effects of EOP on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone/LH  release at intervals from birth to adulthood. Morphine had no effect on serum LH  up to 15 days of age in males, but thereafter was maximally effective. On the  other hand, the onset of adult-appropriate responses to morphine occurred much  later in females (30-35 days) and the depressions in LH were consistently less  pronounced than in comparably aged males. Naloxone produced large increases in LH  in 10- and 25-day-old females, but was ineffective at 15 or 20 days. After day  25, the response to naloxone declined gradually, but was still significantly  greater than control values in adults. In contrast, naloxone failed to increase  serum LH from 10 to 30 days after birth in males. Beginning at 30 to 35 days of  age, however, a sudden onset in the sensitivity to naloxone occurred which  increased exponentially until 60 days. At this time, serum LH levels were 5 times  greater in naloxone-treated males than in controls, and were twice those found in  similarly treated females. These age- and sex-related differences in response to  the opiates were not related to pharmacokinetic variables and also could not be  attributed to gross maturational alternations in the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1986-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","627-633","","3","236","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3512817","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Rats, Inbred Strains; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Age Factors; Sex Factors; Brain/metabolism; Sexual Maturation; Morphine/metabolism/pharmacology; Naloxone/metabolism/pharmacology; Endorphins/*physiology; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/analysis/pharmacology; Hypothalamus/analysis; Luteinizing Hormone/analysis/*metabolism; Pituitary Gland/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphine  analgesia is very frequently co-administered to these patients for pain relief,  along with antiplatelet therapy, at the time of presentation, and prior to  reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: Research  and online content related to opiates use in STEMI was reviewed. Bibliographies  of retrieved studies were searched manually for additional studies and reviews.  RESULTS: There is sufficient data from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  studies showing that the co-administration of morphine with oral P2Y12 receptor  inhibitor results in delayed antiplatelet effects. However, whether this results  in adverse outcomes remains unclear. Data from studies reporting the effect of  morphine on clinical outcomes in STEMI are inconsistent, although they tend to be  underpowered to show an effect on hard clinical outcomes, but some clearly show a  relationship between morphine use and infarct size. Strategies to overcome the  potentially significant negative impact of morphine on platelet reactivity in  STEMI are discussed. CONCLUSION: Whilst clearly definitive, adequately powered,  randomised controlled trials are lacking, we would recommend avoiding the  combination of morphine with oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors and recommend  alternative strategies including intravenous platelet inhibitor strategies, in  high risk patients.","2018","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","477-483","","5","16","","Curr Vasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 29345594","","","","Humans; Risk Factors; Drug Interactions; Treatment Outcome; Drug Administration Schedule; acute coronary syndrome; Stents; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects; Morphine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; antiplatelet therapy; morphine; myocardial infarction; Opiates; *Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/adverse effects/instrumentation; platelet reactivity.; Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction/diagnosis/*therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oxycodone is available in the United States in oral dosage forms and  controlled-release tablets. Studies have demonstrated marked interindividual  variation in the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone. The pharmacokinetics of oral  oxycodone differs from oral morphine in that it has a higher bioavailability, a  slightly longer half-life, and is hepatically metabolized by cytochrome P450  rather than undergoing glucuronidation. Understanding oxycodone pharmacokinetics  favors safe and effective use of this analgesic in a wide variety of patients  with different levels of organ function. A MEDLINE search was conducted to  identify literature published between 1966 and May 2004 relevant to the  pharmacokinetics of oxycodone. These publications were reviewed and the  literature summarized regarding unique and clinically important elements of  oxycodone disposition including its absorption profile (immediate release,  controlled release, rectal administration, and intranasal administration),  distribution, and its metabolism/excretion. Special populations, including  children and those with liver/renal failure, have a unique oxycodone  pharmacokinetic profile that must be taken into account in order to maximize  analgesic efficacy and reduce the risk of adverse events.","2004","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","17-30","","4","18","","J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15760805","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Administration, Oral; Drug Interactions; Half-Life; Intestinal Absorption; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Biological Availability; Tissue Distribution; Child; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Oxycodone/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can increase the water solubility of  lipid-soluble drugs and reduce the rate of clearance of such agents from the  spinal cord into the vasculature after i.t. administration. In this study,  opioids (morphine, lofentanil, alfentanil and sufentanil) with and without CDEX  (20, 2, 0.2 and 0.02% w/v in sterile water) were administered spinally in rats  prepared with chronic i.t. catheters. CDEX prolonged the duration of analgesia  (52.5 degrees C hot plate) and reduced the incidence of catalepsy otherwise  produced by a supermaximal i.t. dose of each of the opioids. The magnitude of the  potentiating effect of CDEX on opioids was dependent upon concentration of the  CDEX and varied with drug lipid partition coefficients. The highest concentration  of CDEX alone (20%) had no effect upon the volume-evoked micturition reflex,  blood pressure, heart rate, or spinal reflexes. Our data indicate that CDEX may  be a useful i.t. vehicle for modifying the redistribution characteristics of  highly diffusible molecules after their i.t. administration, and that for each  drug there is an optimal CDEX concentration. In the present case, CDEX prolongs  the spinal analgesic action and reduces the supraspinal actions of i.t. drugs.","1992-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","592-600","","2","261","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1349642","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Spinal; Drug Carriers; Hemodynamics/drug effects; *Analgesia, Epidural; 2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin; *beta-Cyclodextrins; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Catalepsy/chemically induced; Cyclodextrins/administration & dosage/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to  examine the problem of sedation in elderly patients, we studied the effects and  side effects of continuous peridural anaesthesia for abdominal surgery. METHODS.  On the day before surgery we inserted a peridural catheter (Perifix 400, Braun,  Melsungen, FRG) between T-12 and L-4 in 52 patients in a sitting position (mean  age 69.3 +/- 10.9 years) using the loss-of-resistance technique. If no signs of  spinal anaesthesia became apparent, the exact position of the catheter was  determined using 9 or 10 ml bupivacaine 0.5%. Next day, after premedication with  atropine, pethidine or midazolam, 20-25 ml bupivacaine 0.5% was instilled through  the peridural catheter. During surgery patients were sedated using a small dose  of propofol. We also insufflated oxygen (2 l/min). Blood pressure, heart rate,  and blood gases were monitored and electrocardiography and pulse oximetry  performed. As postoperative pain therapy, we administered morphine through the  peridural catheter at intervals of 8 h. For statistical evaluation we used  Wilcoxon's test. RESULTS. An adequate degree of analgesia was found between T-4  and T-7 and abdominal muscle relaxation was satisfactory. Heart rate decreased by  10.3% after the administration of local anaesthetics. After surgery had begun,  blood pressure decreased over a period of 30 min (systolic by 20.5% and diastolic  by 14.2%) but it remained constant at this level during the rest of the operation  (see Fig. 1). Neither of these side effects was significant. Oxygen saturation  and blood gases were normal. During the operation, a mean dose of 325 mg  propofol/h was necessary to maintain sedation. After surgery all patients were  awake, suffered no pain and had complete amnesia with regard to the operation.  The postoperative peridural dosage of 5 mg morphine (three times in 24 h) was  very effective. Because some patients vomited we used between 50 and 100 mg  tramadol (four times in 24 h) instead of morphine. Early mobilization of patients  was possible and there were no pulmonary complications such as pneumonia.  CONCLUSIONS. If carried out by an experienced physician, continuous peridural  anaesthesia can be an alternative method in abdominal surgery for elderly  patients. We see advantages in the minimal disturbance of pulmonary and mental  function, in the minimal amount of sedation required and in the successful  postoperative pain therapy.","1992-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","634-638","","10","41","","Anaesthesist","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 1443512","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Time Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Morphine/administration & dosage; Propofol; Abdomen/*surgery; Pain, Postoperative/prevention & control; Bupivacaine; Anesthesia, Epidural/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Minimally invasive surgical manipulation consisted  of implantation of subcutaneous pellets under halothane anesthesia. The  experiments were performed in 9 groups of male rats: naive rats (no  manipulation), 4 sham groups (sacrificed 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours after removal of  sham pellets), and 4 morphine groups (sacrificed 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours after  removal of morphine releasing pellets). Receptor autoradiography was performed  with receptor saturation binding studies. The benzodiazepine receptors were  [3H]flunitrazepam labeled; zolpidem binding was used to characterize receptor  subtypes. RESULTS: The surgically manipulated groups, whether treated with  morphine or not, displayed increased benzodiazepine receptor density in  comparison with naive animals for all receptor subtypes. No significant  differences in radioligand affinity were observed for the various receptor  subtypes under any of the experimental conditions. Benzodiazepine receptor uptake  did not differ significantly between morphine treated and untreated animals.  CONCLUSIONS: Surgical stress increases benzodiazepine receptor density but does  not alter affinity. Loss of tolerance to morphine does not seem to play an  important role in surgically caused stress.","2006-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","479-487","","8","53","","Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 17125013","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Narcotics/*pharmacokinetics; *Autoradiography; *Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Hippocampus/*chemistry; Receptors, GABA-A/*analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats were rendered tolerant  to etorphine by s.c. implantation of osmotic minipumps containing 3 mg/ml of  etorphine for up to 7 days. During this period, there were a time-dependent  increase in the AD50 values of etorphine to inhibit the tail-flick response and  an increase in naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs. When these animals and  others were sacrificed and the opiate receptor binding properties were examined,  it could be demonstrated that there was also a time-dependent decrease in the  amount of [3H]diprenorphine specifically bound, with maximal attenuation reached  3 days after implantation. There was no alteration in alpha 2 adrenergic receptor  binding. This observed decrease in [3H]diprenorphine binding was not due to the  presence of nonwashed etorphine in the membrane, for acute administration of the  same dose of etorphine before sacrificing did not produce an attenuation of the  opiate receptor binding. Further examination of opiate receptor binding in the  brain regions of cortex, midbrain and striatum revealed the greatest decrease in  the amount of [3H]diprenorphine bound in striatal region after chronic etorphine  treatment, a 68% decrease. When the relative decrease in mu and delta opioid  receptor binding was determined by carrying out [3H]-D-Ala2, DLeu5-enkephalin  binding in the presence of 1 microM morphiceptin, it was observed that, 3 days  after etorphine treatment, there was a decrease in mu opioid receptor binding,  with minimal change in delta opioid receptor binding in both brain regions of  striatum and midbrain.

There is no doubt that tramadol has revolutionized pain  treatment, making it important to understand the pharmacokinetics and  pharmacodynamics in order to provide patients with the safest and most effective  analgesia. RECENT FINDINGS: Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic  with a multimode of action used to help treat moderate to severe pain.  Pharmacologically, the unique opioid acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake  inhibitor, while its metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol, acts on the μ-opioid  receptor. The analgesic strength of tramadol is about one-tenth that of morphine,  making it a relatively safe analgesic. Potential side effects of tramadol include  nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, and respiratory depression; however,  the severity of these symptoms is minimal compared to traditional opioids.  Although some of the perioperative uses of tramadol may be rare, it is a pain  management option to consider when alternatives have proved ineffective.","2022-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","241-246","","3","26","","Curr Pain Headache Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Buccal mucosa appears to be a potential site  for delivery of morphine as it provides direct entry into the system circulation  thereby avoiding the hepatic first-pass effect. However, the low permeability of  the buccal epithelium results in a low flux of the drug. The use of a penetration  enhancer is required to improve the bioavailability of the drug via buccal route.  In this study, the enhancing effect of sodium glycocholate (GC) used at 10 mM and  100 mM concentrations on permeation of morphine hydrochloride (MPH) across the  porcine buccal mucosa was studied in vitro. Furthermore, in conjunction with its  permeation, accumulation of GC in the tissue with time was also studied in order  to elucidate the relationship between GC and enhanced mucosal permeation of the  drug. Franz diffusion cells were used in the experiments. Permeation of MPH was  increased in the presence of 100 mM GC with an enhancement factor of 9.3 whereas  no enhancement was obtained with 10 mM GC. The calculated permeability  coefficient for MPH in the presence of 100 mM GC was 2.35 x 10(-5) cm/s.  Accumulation of GC at 100 mM in the tissue appears to be more significant at 100  mM concentration which correlated well with the increased permeation of the drug.  GC was diffused through the buccal epithelium significantly at 100 mM  concentration. Interaction of GC with the tissue appears to be more significant  at 100 mM concentration compared to 10 mM concentration, thus resulting in a  significant enhancing effect.","1998-02-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","107-113","","2-3","51","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 9685907","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Swine; Diffusion; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Epithelial Cells/metabolism; Cheek; Mouth Mucosa/*metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics; Glycocholic Acid/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concurrent pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the cisternal  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug level is considerably lower than the lumbar CSF  level during continuous infusion into the lumbar subarachnoid space. One factor  that makes analysis of this decline in drug level difficult to quantify is that  it is only feasible to sample CSF at the two extremes of the spinal subarachnoid  space. Using a radionuclide technique, we have examined the distribution along  the spinal canal of a hydrophilic compound, indium-111 diethylenetriamine  pentaacetic acid, that was delivered over 72 hours into the lumbar subarachnoid  space in five patients with implanted drug pumps. Over a 20-cm distance of the  thoracic cord, radionuclide counts decreased gradually so that the indium-111  diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid concentration surrounding the cord at the T2  vertebral level was 43% of that at the T12 level in four patients. Therefore, it  appears that even with a hydrophilic compound, which minimizes spinal cord  capillary losses, there is still a considerable reduction of CSF drug  concentration along the spinal canal. The clinical implication of this gradual  decline in drug level is that for intrathecal infusion of relatively hydrophilic  compounds there may not be any advantage in placing the catheter tip at more  rostral locations, such as at the midthoracic or cervical cord.","1993-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","226-230; discussion 230","","2","33","","Neurosurgery","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7690122","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Spinal Cord/drug effects/*metabolism; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Hydromorphone/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; *Infusion Pumps, Implantable; Analgesia, Epidural/instrumentation; Baclofen/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Endometrial Neoplasms/physiopathology; Injections, Spinal/*instrumentation; Multiple Sclerosis/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy; Muscle Spasticity/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy; Pain, Intractable/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy; Prostatic Neoplasms/physiopathology; Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy; Spinal Cord Injuries/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This report describes an inpatient clinical evaluation of  the safety of buprenorphine alone and in combination with single doses of cocaine  and morphine. Twenty subjects with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of concurrent cocaine  and opioid dependence were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with single  daily doses of 4 or 8 mg of sublingual buprenorphine for 21 days. Side effects  and vital signs were evaluated every day once every 8 hours and for 2 hours after  daily buprenorphine administration. The physiologic effects of a single-blind  challenge dose of cocaine (30 mg intravenously), morphine (10 mg intravenously),  and intravenous saline placebo were measured before and during buprenorphine  maintenance. Before buprenorphine maintenance, subjects underwent methadone  detoxification followed by a 9-day drug-free period. Three baseline single-blind  challenge dose studies were conducted on study days 7, 8, and 9 during the  drug-free period. Cardiovascular responses to cocaine and to morphine were  equivalent under drug-free and buprenorphine maintenance conditions. Respiration  and temperature changes in response to cocaine were also equivalent before and  during buprenorphine maintenance. Respiratory rates were slightly lower after  morphine administration during maintenance on 8 mg of buprenorphine, but this was  not statistically significant. Mild opioid agonist-like side effects were  reported during buprenorphine induction and maintenance. These included headache,  sedation, nasal discharge, abdominal discomfort, and anxiety. Most opioid agonist  side effects decreased within 12 to 14 days. An electrocardiogram and blood  chemistry measures were normal before and during buprenorphine maintenance. These  data suggest that daily maintenance on buprenorphine is not associated with  adverse side effects or toxic interactions with a single acute dose of  intravenous cocaine or morphine.","1993-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","87-99","","2","13","","J Clin Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8463453","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Liver Function Tests; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Single-Blind Method; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Arousal/drug effects; Morphine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Administration, Sublingual; Buprenorphine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Cocaine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Heroin Dependence/blood/psychology/*rehabilitation; Substance-Related Disorders/blood/psychology/*rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This indicated that elevation of morphine  level in rats by haloperidol was more likely due to a competitive mechanism.","1986-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","199-205","","2","38","","Pol J Pharmacol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 3748892","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Liver/*enzymology; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Organ Size/drug effects; Haloperidol/*pharmacology; Morphine/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Dogs  were chronically implanted with a lumbar intrathecal or epidural catheter and  received daily injections for 28 or 15 days, respectively, of saline or one of  three mu agonists: sufentanil (intrathecal 5, 25, or 50 micrograms/0.5 ml;  epidural 10, 50, or 100 micrograms/2.0 ml), alfentanil (intrathecal 40 or 400  micrograms/0.5 ml; epidural 80 or 800 micrograms/2.0 ml), or morphine  (intrathecal 0.5 or 5 mg/0.5 ml; epidural 1 or 10 mg/2.0 ml). Dogs were examined  for antinociception (skin twitch) and neurobehavioral changes. When the animals  were killed, cisternal cerebrospinal fluid was taken for clinical chemistry, and  after perfusion fixation, spinal cord tissue was taken for histologic analysis.  RESULTS: Bolus intrathecal and epidural injections of sufentanil, alfentanil, and  morphine produced dose dependent antinociception, bradycardia, an initial  tachypnea followed by a decrease in respiratory rate, hypothermia and somnolence.  The order of potency was sufentanil > alfentanil > morphine on all measures. Over  the extended period of drug delivery, a loss of response (tolerance) was observed  on all measures. No abnormal morphologic or histologic effects were found when  comparing the drug and dose groups. An inflammatory reaction secondary to the  catheter was found in all animals. Intrathecal, but not epidural, catheters  resulted in significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid protein and cell counts  in vehicle animals. Values in drug treated animals did not differ significantly  from the respective vehicle controls. A rapid systemic redistribution of all  three drugs was observed. No differences were found in the pharmacokinetic  parameters measured at day 1 and at the day of killing for any route.  CONCLUSIONS: This large-animal model demonstrates the expected pharmacologic  potency of these three agents and tolerance development. Based on cerebrospinal  fluid and systematic histopathologic analyses, these three spinally administered  agents showed no evidence of neurotoxicity over the range of doses/concentrations  employed when given by the intrathecal or epidural route as compared to vehicle  controls. Consideration of the toxicokinetics in this canine model suggests that  it provides an appropriate test of the safety of these agents in concentrations  which exceed those employed for daily intermittent epidural and intrathecal drug  delivery in humans.","1994-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","899-920","","4","81","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7943841","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Dogs; Heart Rate/drug effects/physiology; Body Temperature; Injections, Spinal; Pain/physiopathology; Injections, Epidural; *Anesthesia, Spinal; Morphine/*administration & dosage/blood; Respiration/drug effects/physiology; Behavior, Animal/drug effects/physiology; Alfentanil/*administration & dosage/blood; Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology; Sufentanil/*administration & dosage/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study was designed to  examine in rats the temporal and dosage parameters of naloxone-induced  potentiation of morphine analgesia and the effect of continuous infusion of  naloxone on the analgesic potency of other mu agonists. Cumulative dose-response  curves were generated in a tail-flick procedure for each drug tested.  Naloxone-filled osmotic pumps were then implanted s.c. for 1 week after which the  rats were retested with the agonist. The potency ratio of morphine (ED50 before  naloxone/ED50 after naloxone) showed orderly increases over a range of naloxone  doses (0.03-1.0 mg/kg/hr) and increased, then decreased, over a range of time  points (6-72 hr) after removal of the osmotic pumps. The relative potency of  morphine was 2.1 at 24 hr after a 7-day infusion of 0.3 mg/kg/hr of naloxone.  These parameters were then used in tests of other mu agonists. Five drugs  produced maximum increases in tail-flick latencies before naloxone. Of these,  naloxone increased the analgesic potency of fentanyl, methadone and levorphanol  (relative potencies ranged from 1.7-2.1) but not of etorphine and propoxyphene.  The naloxone infusion increased the maximum analgesic effect of meperidine,  profadol and pentazocine, but had no effect on the analgesic activity of  buprenorphine, butorphanol, ethylketocyclazocine and nalbuphine.

Ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs), individuals with multiple active  copies of CYP2D6, can biotranform up to 50% more codeine into morphine than  normal individuals can. In contrast, poor metabolizers (PMs), individuals who  have no active CYP2D6 genes, convert almost no codeine into morphine and as a  result may take multiple doses of codeine without attaining analgesia. OBJECTIVE:  The aim was to study the relationship between CYP2D6 genotype and codeine  analgesia among women recovering from c-section. METHODS: Forty-five mothers  prescribed codeine provided a blood sample for CYP2D6 genotyping and recorded  their pain level 4 times a day for 3 days immediately after a c-section. Codeine  was used on an as-needed basis; doses and times were recorded. The relationship  between CYP2D6 genotype, pain scores, need for codeine, and adverse events was  studied. Theoretical morphine dose, based on CYP2D6 genotype, was estimated.  RESULTS: Women at the genotypic extremes reported codeine effects consistent with  their genotype: the 2 PMs of codeine reported no analgesia as a result of taking  codeine, whereas 2 of the 3 UMs reported immediate pain relief from codeine but  stopped taking it due to dizziness and constipation. Much larger numbers are  needed to study similar correlations among extensive and intermediate  metabolizers. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the extreme CYP2D6 genotypes (PMs  and UMs) seemed to predict pain response and adverse events. Larger sample sizes  are needed to correlate the range of genotypes with pain response.","2011-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:56:15","","425-432","","4","33","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= vanderVaart2011 PMID: 21743374 place: United States","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Biotransformation; Young Adult; Genotype; Pilot Projects; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/*metabolism; Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics; Pain Measurement/methods; Postpartum Period; Analgesia; Morphine/blood; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Cesarean Section/methods; Codeine/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Pain, Postoperative/blood/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Doses of opioid antagonists were  administered cumulatively before each trial of a session following 4-h  pretreatment with either vehicle or morphine (3.0 mg/kg). Morphine pretreatment  sensitized rats to naltrexone, lowering its ED50 from 20 to 0.03 mg/kg. It also  sensitized rats to naloxone and to diprenorphine, another pure antagonist.  Morphine-induced sensitization was stereoselective among the optical isomers of  the benzomorphans, cyclazocine, pentazocine, and N-allylnormetzocine. In  addition, acute morphine pretreatment resulted in sensitization to the mixed  agonist/antagonist nalorphine, but not to buprenorphine or nalbuphine.

To evaluate the functional role of this stressor and to modulate  it, rats were subcutaneously pretreated with the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide  (CDP; 10 mg/kg) or saline (SAL) before the immobilization in the Bolman cages and  before the intravenous administration of small doses of morphine (MOR),  sufentanil (SUF), or vehicle (VEH). Antinociception, respiratory impairment and  stress were evaluated by means of the tail-flick latency, blood gas analysis, and  serum corticosterone (CS), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and prolactin  (PRL) determinations. The results demonstrated that 10 mg/kg CDP did not alter  the antinociceptive effects of low doses of morphine and sufentanil. CDP  pretreatment differentially affected the various blood gas parameters. Compared  to vehicle pretreatment, there was a larger decrease in PaO2 following MOR and  SUF in the CDP-pretreated rats. The effects were most pronounced at the lowest  doses of both opioids. A CDP potentiation was also observed for the short-lasting  raises in PaCO2 with the lowest concentrations of the opioids. At higher  concentrations of the opioids, CDP was without any effect. With regard to the  stress hormones, immobilization and an intravenous injection resulted in  increases in CS and PRL in both CDP- and VEH-pretreated rats. ACTH did not change  in these controls. SUF prevented the CS raises independent of a CDP pretreatment,  while ACTH only increased in the SUF plus CDP groups, pointing to a  stress-reducing effect of SUF. Also, MOR without CDP prevented the increases in  CS, but the opioid intrinsically increased ACTH. These results indicate that  restraint in Bolman cages in the present setup, with animals recovering for  several hours in these cages after being equipped with an arterial catheter, is  stressful but without any significant effect on the opioid-induced  antinociception. Pretreatment with an anxiolytic benzodiazepine only minimally  affected the outcome of the opioids on respiratory depression and pointed to a  stress-reducing effect of low doses of the opioids, especially sufentanil.","1998-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:54:56","","663-670","","3","59","","Pharmacol Biochem Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Verborgh1998a PMID: 9512069 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Rats, Wistar; Anti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacology; Blood Gas Analysis; Nociceptors/*drug effects; Restraint, Physical; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Adrenal Cortex Hormones/blood; Morphine/pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Respiratory Insufficiency/chemically induced; Respiratory Mechanics/*drug effects; Chlordiazepoxide/*pharmacology; Stress, Psychological/blood/*psychology; Sufentanil/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this narrative review is to evaluate the  pharmacokinetic properties, safety, tolerability, and analgesic efficacy of these  agents in the management of postoperative pain. EXPERT OPINION: Oliceridine  appears to be an effective and potentially safer μ opioid receptor agonist. Its  main advantages are a relatively fast onset with reduced respiratory depression,  nausea, and vomiting. Cebranopadol is an agonist at multiple opioid receptors, of  which μ opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor are most  significant. It is an oral drug that appears to have efficacy in neuropathic  pain, with reduced respiratory depression and abuse potential. Lastly,  morphine-6-glucuronide is an active metabolite of morphine with a slower onset  than its parent compound. It has failed to demonstrate appreciable benefit in the  context of postoperative analgesia.","2022-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1831-1843","","16","23","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36302462","","","","Humans; Morphine; Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy; TRV130; postoperative pain; M6G; Receptors, Opioid; *Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects; *Respiratory Insufficiency/drug therapy/chemically induced; biased-signaling opioids; cebranopadol; MOP receptor agonist; morphine-6-gluconuride; mu opioid receptor agonist; new opioids; NOP receptor agonists; novel opioids; oliceridine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL/METHODS:  Endogenous morphine levels were determined by high performance liquid  chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection and radioimmunoassay,  following incubation of Mytilus edulis pedal ganglia with reticuline or L-DOPA.  Injection of L-DOPA or reticuline into healthy animals was via the foot. RESULTS:  Ganglia incubated in vitro with reticuline or L-DOPA for 1 hour exhibited a  concentration and time dependent statistically significant increase in their  endogenous morphine levels (5.0 +/- 0.47, 3.6 +/- 0.45 ng/ganglion,  respectively). Injection of intact, healthy animals with reticuline or L-DOPA  also results in significantly higher endogenous ganglionic morphine levels.  CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we show that L-DOPA is being converted to morphine,  demonstrating that pedal ganglia can synthesize morphine from these putative  precursors in vitro and in vivo. This is the first demonstration of morphine  being synthesized in a normal, healthy free living animal.","2005-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","MS1-5","","5","11","","Med Sci Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15874894","","","","Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Alkaloids/*pharmacology; Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology; Morphine/*metabolism; Bivalvia/*drug effects/*metabolism; Ganglia/*drug effects/*metabolism; Levodopa/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  studies in children report variable durations of analgesia following IT morphine.  The purpose of this study is to describe the duration of analgesia in children  undergoing surgical correction of idiopathic scoliosis. DESIGN: Retrospective  chart review. SETTING: Pediatric hospital within a tertiary care academic medical  center. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis who  received IT morphine following posterior spinal fusion (PSF). MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURE(S): Mean opioid exposure 0-12 hours and 13-24 hours post-IT morphine.  RESULTS: Mean opioid exposure was significantly increased during the 13-24-hour  compared to the 0-12-hour time period (23.0 ± 12.5 mg parenteral morphine vs 15.9  ± 1.7 mg; p = 0.0006). The only factors significantly associated with morphine  exposure during the 0-12-hour period included the median pain score (0-12 hours)  (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.033-3.80; p = 0.046) and  total acetaminophen dose (OR, 0.003; 95% CI, 0.0008-0.005; p = 0.011).  CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that patients experienced improved analgesia for  at least 12 hours following IT morphine. Increased use of adjuvant analgesics  such as acetaminophen may reduce opioid requirements following PSF procedures.

We have revisited an  established chicken model for NAS to describe the distribution of morphine and  methadone to the brain and explore its validity as a valuable alternative to  rodent models. For this purpose, chicken eggs were injected with a single dose of  10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg morphine or 20 mg/kg methadone onto the chorioallantoic  membrane (CAM) on embryonal day 13. Whole brains and lungs were harvested and the  concentrations of morphine, methadone and their subsequent metabolites  (morphine-3-glucuronide and EDDP, respectively) determined in the brain and lungs  at different time points using LC-MS/MS. Morphine and methadone, as well as their  metabolites, were detected both in the brain and lungs, with significantly higher  concentrations in the lungs. Pharmacokinetic modelling showed that the  distribution of morphine to the brain followed a first-order absorption with  transit compartments and linear elimination, with concentrations linearly  dependent on dose. Moreover, methadone, but not morphine, reduced μ receptor (the  main morphine receptor) binding, which can be of relevance for opioid tolerance.  The present study is the first to report the brain distribution of morphine,  which can be described by standard pharmacokinetic processes, and methadone in  the developing chicken embryo. The present findings supplement the already  established model and support the use of this chicken model to study NAS.","2023-11-15","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","116731","","","479","","Toxicol Appl Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

These differences are thought to be due to interaction with a distinct subset of  opioid receptors. Although it relieves severe pain, the drug does not usually  elevate mood, and it may occasionally cause dysphoria. Counterbalancing its  disadvantages is a wealth of clinical experience with the drug showing an  impressive record of safety. Butorphanol produces limited respiratory depression  and smooth muscle spasm, and both effects are reversible with naloxone. The most  prominent side effect is sedation, a property that is generally quite useful in  the perioperative period. Butorphanol is a weak morphine antagonist, so it may  interact with agonists like morphine or fentanyl. The chief advantages of this  agent are its low toxicity and very low potential for abuse.","1988","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","2-7","","","12 Suppl 1","","Acute Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2830756","","","","Humans; Animals; Morphine/*antagonists & inhibitors; Morphinans/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid/*drug effects; Butorphanol/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Midazolam, sufentanil,  and remifentanil were main sedatives and analgesics used in the patient  population. The morphine equivalents, representative of the demand for opioids,  was 512.9 (IQR, 294.5, 798.2) mg/day. The midazolam equivalents, representative  of benzodiazepine requirement, was 279.6 (IQR, 208.8, 384.5) mg/day. The levels  of serum creatinine, total bilirubin, lactic acid, SOFA score, and APACHE Ⅱ score  at cannulation were found to be associated with opiate or benzodiazepine  requirements. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a linear correlation  between midazolam equivalents and morphine equivalents (p < 0.001). In addition,  there was a negative linear correlation between Acute Physiology and Chronic  Health Evaluation Ⅱ (APACHE Ⅱ) score and midazolam equivalents (p = 0.024).  CONCLUSIONS: The sedation and analgesia requirements of ARDS patients receiving  VV-ECMO often increase simultaneously. More large-scale studies are needed to  confirm the risk factors for increased sedation and analgesia needs in patients  supported on VV-ECMO.","2023-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","313-319","","2","38","","Perfusion","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 34743615","","","","Adult; Humans; pharmacokinetics; Retrospective Studies; *Analgesia; *Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; analgesia; ECMO; Morphine Derivatives; *Respiratory Distress Syndrome/drug therapy; Benzodiazepines/therapeutic use; Midazolam/therapeutic use; sedation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The chemotherapeutic  irinotecan (CPT-11) causes severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity due to  deconjugation of inactive metabolite SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) by bacterial  β-glucuronidases to the active 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38). Opioids  are known to cause gut microbial dysbiosis, this study evaluated whether CPT-11  anti-tumour efficacy and GI toxicity are exacerbated by opioid co-administration.  EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were co-administration  with CPT-11 ± opioid. 16S rRNA sequencing was used for gut microbiome analysis.  LC-MS analyses of plasma and intestinal extracts were performed to investigate  the pharmacokinetic profile of CPT-11. Histological analysis and quantitative  real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the severity of  intestinal tissue damage. Human liver microsome In vitro assay was performed to  confirm the effects of opioids on CPT-11 metabolism. KEY RESULTS: Gut microbiome  analysis showed that morphine treatment induced enrichment of  β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestines of CPT-11-treated mice,  resulting in SN-38 accumulation and exacerbation of GI toxicity in the small  intestine. Oral administration of both antibiotics and glucuronidase inhibitor  protected mice against GI toxicity induced with CPT-11 and morphine  co-administration, implicating a microbiome-dependent mechanism. Additionally,  morphine and loperamide decreased the plasma concentration of SN-38 and  compromised CPT-11 anti-tumour efficacy, this seemed to be microbiome  independent. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Gut microbiota play a significant role  in opioid and chemotherapeutic agent drug-drug interactions. Inhibition of gut  microbial glucuronidase may also prevent adverse GI effects of CPT-11 in patients  on opioids.","2023-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1362-1378","","10","180","","Br J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 British Pharmacological Society.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36562107  PMCID: PMC10089971","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Disease Models, Animal; drug metabolism; opioids; Dysbiosis; gut microbiome; Bacteria; Irinotecan; chemotherapy; irinotecan; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacology; Morphine Derivatives/pharmacology; *Neoplasms; *Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/toxicity; Camptothecin/toxicity; CPT-11; Glucuronidase/metabolism/pharmacology; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats  were rendered tolerant by injection of a slow-release emulsion containing  morphine (75 mg/rat over 48 h), and when challenged with naloxone, they exhibited  a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that included acute diarrhea. Morphine  tolerance did not influence water absorption from ileal or colonic loops in vivo  but naloxone-induced withdrawal provoked a rapid and sustained reduction in  absorption. Naloxone did not affect absorption in control animals. In further  experiments, sodium and chloride fluxes were measured in isolated stripped ileal  mucosa derived from animals made tolerant to morphine and withdrawn with  naloxone. Net sodium and chloride absorption was markedly reduced in mucosa  derived from withdrawn animals compared with that derived from tolerant animals  (Na+: 1.12 +/- 0.76 vs. 5.52 +/- 0.46, and Cl-: 0.60 +/- 0.52 vs. 4.70 +/- 0.80  microEq/cm2 X h, in withdrawn and tolerant animals, respectively; n = 8; p less  than 0.001 and p less than 0.005). When an attempt was made to induce withdrawal  by adding naloxone in vitro to isolated mucosa derived from tolerant animals, no  effect on transport was detected whether the mucosa was stripped of muscle layers  or not. Thus naloxone had to be given in vivo to produce withdrawal effects in  mucosa studied subsequently in vitro. Naloxone also had an effect in control rats  when a 50% reduction in net chloride absorption was observed in isolated ileal  mucosa derived from these animals. Net sodium absorption was unaffected. These  data support a role for endogenous opiates in the control of intestinal transport  and provide a mechanism for the diarrhea associated with opiate withdrawal.","1984-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1035-1041","","5","87","","Gastroenterology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6541171","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Binding Sites; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; Drug Tolerance; Biological Transport/drug effects; Ileum/metabolism; Intestines/drug effects; Naloxone/pharmacology; Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/*metabolism; Sodium/metabolism; Chlorides/metabolism; Membrane Potentials/drug effects; Water-Electrolyte Balance/*drug effects; Morphine/*pharmacology; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/chemically induced/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we have investigated the role of CaM in regulating changes in  OP(3)-G protein coupling during morphine treatment, shown to result in CaM  release from plasma membranes. Basal and agonist-stimulated G protein coupling by  OP(3) was measured before and after morphine pretreatment by incorporation of  guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thiotriphosphate) into membranes, obtained from HEK 293  cells transfected with human OP(3) cDNA. The opioid antagonist  beta-chlornaltrexamine fully suppressed basal G protein coupling of OP(3),  providing a direct measure of basal signaling. Pretreatment of the cells with  morphine enhanced basal G protein coupling (sensitization). In contrast,  agonist-stimulated coupling was diminished (desensitization), resulting in a  substantially flattened morphine dose-response curve. To test whether CaM is  involved in these changes, we constructed OP(3)-i3 loop mutants with reduced  affinity for CaM (K273A, R275A, and K273A/R275A). Basal signaling of these mutant  OP(3) receptors was higher than that of the wild-type receptor and, moreover,  unaffected by morphine pretreatment, whereas desensitization to agonist  stimulation was only slightly attenuated. Therefore, CaM-OP(3) interactions  appear to play only a minor role in the desensitization of OP(3). In contrast,  release of CaM from the plasma membrane appears to enhance the inherent basal G  protein coupling of OP(3), thereby resolving the paradox that OP(3) displays both  desensitization and sensitization during morphine treatment.","2000-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","763-771","","2","75","","J Neurochem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10899953","","","","Humans; Kidney; Kinetics; Animals; Cell Line; Amino Acid Substitution; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism; Transfection; Chickens; Cell Membrane/physiology; Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology; Naltrexone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Morphine/*pharmacology; Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacokinetics; Naloxone/pharmacokinetics; Calmodulin/*physiology; Egtazic Acid/pharmacology; GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology; Receptors, Opioid, mu/chemistry/genetics/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One explanation for  this observation is that the rate, extent, and/or primary site of glucuronide  hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract changes during postnatal development. To  test this hypothesis, the hydrolysis of two model glucuronide conjugates,  valproate glucuronide and morphine-3-beta,D-glucuronide, was examined in vitro in  homogenates of small and large intestine obtained from rats at 5-60 days  postpartum. Analysis of initial hydrolysis rates indicated that the principal  hydrolytic site for both glucuronide conjugates shifted from the upper to lower  intestine as the animals developed. The initial hydrolysis rate (nmol/min/g) for  valproate glucuronide decreased from 38.1 +/- 10.2 to 8.25 +/- 2.42 in the small  intestine, and increased from 14.2 +/- 2.3 to 105 +/- 22 in the large intestine,  as rats developed from 5 to 60 days postpartum, respectively. Likewise, the  intestinal hydrolysis rate for morphine-3-beta,D-glucuronide decreased from 3.70  +/- 0.46 to 0.646 +/- 0.165 in the small intestine, and increased from 3.50 +/-  0.48 to 115 +/- 30 in the large intestine, as rats developed from 5 to 60 days  postpartum, respectively. If hydrolysis occurs immediately after excretion of  conjugate into the intestine in neonatal rats, minimal temporal delay between  excretion of conjugate and reabsorption of liberated parent may occur, therefore  concealing the secondary increase in serum drug concentrations associated with  enterohepatic recirculation. In contrast, the time required for conjugates to  reach the primary hydrolytic site in adult animals is sufficient for appearance  of secondary peaks in the serum drug concentration-time profile.","1994-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","120-123","","1","22","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8149870","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Age Factors; Hydrolysis; Drug Carriers; Glucuronates/metabolism; Morphine/*metabolism; Intestine, Large/growth & development/*metabolism; Intestine, Small/growth & development/*metabolism; Valproic Acid/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The P-gp  is also expressed by different types of tumors. The aim of this study was to  determine the potential association of the P-gp expression in malignant tumors  with analgesic effects in patients. METHODS: The P-gp expression in 120 malignant  tumors was examined by immunohistochemistry. The analgesic responses of  individual patients to morphine and buprenorphine (BNP) were evaluated by visual  analog scale (VAS). The levels of plasma morphine and BNP were determined by  HPLC. RESULTS: We found that there was no significant difference in the values of  VAS between patients with P-gp(+) and P-gp(-) malignant tumors in responses to  0.000025 g x kg(-2) of BNP administered by patient-controlled intravenous  analgesia (PCIA), accompanied by similar levels of plasma BNP in those patients.  In contrast, the values of VAS in response to 0.00075 g x kg(-2) of morphine in  patients with P-gp(+) tumors were significantly greater than those in the  patients with P-gp(-) tumors, although similar levels of plasma morphine were  detected in both groups of patients. Furthermore, treatment with a higher dose  (0.0011 g x kg(-2)) of morphine effectively controlled pain in those with P-gp(+)  tumors. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that patients with P-gp(+) tumors required  a higher dose of morphine to achieve an analgesic effect and that the P-gp  expression in tumors may be valuable for predicting the analgesic responses of  patients with severe pain to morphine.","2012","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:51:05","","870-877","","4","64","","Pharmacol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Wang2012c PMID: 23087138 place: Switzerland","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Immunohistochemistry; Pain Measurement/methods; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/metabolism; Morphine/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled/methods; Neoplasms/blood/complications/*metabolism; Analgesics/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Buprenorphine/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics; Pain/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In  the present study, the effect of graded doses of trans-resveratrol was studied  using a hot plate analgesiometer in rats. trans-Resveratrol at graded doses of 5,  10, 20 and 40 mg/kg i.p. produced dose-dependent analgesia. Pretreatment (20 min)  with naloxone (1 mg/kg i.p.) blocked the analgesic effect. When the submaximal  dose of trans-resveratrol (5 mg/kg i.p.) was combined with a submaximal dose of  morphine (2 mg/kg i.p.), a potentiation effect was observed. The effect of  trans-resveratrol (20 mg/kg i.p.) was also studied on morphine tolerance. Rats  were divided into different groups: Group 1: morphine (10 mg/kg i.p.); Group 2:  trans-resveratrol (5 mg/kg i.p.) administered 10 min before morphine (2 mg/kg  i.p.); Group 3: trans-resveratrol (20 mg/kg i.p.) per se. Vehicle treated groups  were run parallel. The treatment continued for 7 days. The occurrence of  tolerance was estimated by comparing the antinociceptive effect of morphine with  trans-resveratrol on day 1 and day 8. Both morphine and trans-resveratrol  produced tolerance. However, in the group that received the combination of  submaximal doses of trans-resveratrol and morphine, there was insignificant  tolerance. These findings suggest that trans-resveratrol analgesia is mediated  via an opioidergic mechanism and produces tolerance to its analgesic effect  similar to morphine.","2004-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","667-672","","9","26","","Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2004 Prous Science.

One of the most effective methods used for eliminating this pain is  epidural analgesia. The aim of this study to determine the impact of adding  morphine to low-dose bupivacaine epidural anesthesia on labor and neonatal  outcomes, and maternal side effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective  randomized double-blind study comparing two regimens of anesthetic agents used  for epidural anesthesia in labor. A total of 120 pregnant women were randomized  into two groups with 60 subjects in each study arm. A catheter was inserted, and  0.1% bupivacaine + 2 μg/mL fentanyl in 15 mL saline were given to Group  bupivacaine-fentanyl (Group BF), while 0.0625% bupivacaine + 2 μg/ml fentanyl + 2  mg morphine in 15 mL saline were given to Group bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine  (Group BFM) with no test dosing from the needle. No morphine was added to the  subsequent epidural injections in Group BFM. RESULTS: The total dose of  bupivacaine was significantly lower in Group BFM relative to Group BF (P =  0.0001). The visual analogu scalescores at 15, 30, and 45 min were significantly  lower in Group BF compared to thosein Group BFM (P = 0.0001, P = 0.001, and P =  0.006, respectively). The second stage of labor was significantly shorter in  Group BFM relative to Group BF (P = 0.027 and P = 0.003, respectively). The  satisfaction with analgesia following the first dose was higher in the  nonmorphine group (P = 0.0001). However, maternal postpartum satisfaction was  similar in both groups. Either nausea or vomiting was recorded in eight patients  in Group BFM. CONCLUSION: We believe that epidural analgesia comprised of a  low-dose local anaesthetic and 2 mg morphine provides a painless labor that  significantly reducesthe use of local anesthetic without changing the efficiency  of the analgesic, ensuring the mother's satisfaction without leading to an  adverse effect on the mother or foetus, while mildly (but significantly)  shortening the second stage of labor.","2014-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","205-211","","2","17","","Niger J Clin Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: India PMID: 24553033","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Prospective Studies; Double-Blind Method; Follow-Up Studies; Treatment Outcome; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Drug Therapy, Combination; Pain Measurement; Injections, Spinal; Apgar Score; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Analgesia, Epidural/*methods; Labor, Obstetric/*drug effects; Morphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Fetal Blood/*metabolism; Analgesia, Obstetrical/*methods; Anesthetics, Local/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Bupivacaine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implications for combined spinal-epidural  anesthesia.","Anesthesiology","","0003-3022","10.1097/00000542-199404000-00019","","BACKGROUND: Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia is a technique growing in popularity. However, there have been no attempts to investigate the risk of  epidural drug reaching the subarachnoid space in high concentration by passing  through the meningeal hole left by the spinal needle. This study begins to  address this question by quantitating the flux of morphine and lidocaine through  the spinal meninges of the monkey in vitro after puncture with three  different-sized needles. METHODS: Spinal meningeal tissue from anesthetized  monkeys was mounted in a diffusion cell and drug flux was measured through intact  tissue and through tissue punctured with a 27-G Whitacre, a 24-G Sprotte, and an  18-G Tuohy needle. RESULTS: The flux of morphine through the meningeal tissue was  significantly increased by puncture with each of the study needles. The flux of  lidocaine was significantly increased only by puncture with the 24-G Sprotte and  18-G Tuohy needles. The flux of morphine through intact tissue was less than the  flux of lidocaine through intact tissue. In contrast, the flux of morphine and  lidocaine were the same through tissue punctured with the study needles. The  magnitude of the drug flux through the needle puncture was a function of the  diameter of the study needle. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural anesthesia after accidental  or intentional puncture of the spinal meninges has occasionally resulted in high  spinal blocks and total spinal anesthesia. This study suggests that drug movement  through the meningeal hole is responsible for this complication and that the risk  may be decreased by using the smallest possible needle to puncture the meninges.","1994-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","853-858","","4","80","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8024140","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Models, Biological; Permeability; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; *Punctures; Macaca nemestrina; Spinal Cord Injuries/*metabolism; Lidocaine/*pharmacokinetics; Anesthesia, Spinal/*adverse effects/methods; *Needlestick Injuries; Anesthesia, Epidural/*adverse effects/methods; Meninges/*injuries/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vivo studies have indicated the involvement of  dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type) voltage-gated channels in morphine abuse. In  this study, the effect of multiple administration of the dihydropyridine calcium  channel blocker nifedipine (5 mg/kg/twice daily), given in combination with  morphine, on the signs of morphine withdrawal and some biochemical parameters  were assessed. Multiple morphine administration in increasing doses (from 5 to 40  mg/kg for 7 days) and consequent withdrawal after 18 h, induced writhing,  squealing, diarrhea, teeth chattering, eyelid ptosis and wet-dog type shaking.  Coadministration of nifedipine prevented the squealing, diarrhea and teeth  chattering. On a biochemical level, the activity of brain nitric oxide synthase  (NOS) and the quantity of cytochrome P450 in rat brain and liver were measured.  Nifedipine treatment decreased the brain nNOS activity, induced by multiple  administration of morphine. The quantity of liver cytochrome P450, after multiple  coadministration of morphine and nifedipine, was also increased. The quantity of  brain cytochrome P450 was not significantly changed by morphine and nifedipine  alone or in combination. The results of our study suggest that nifedipine  influences the effects of morphine both at a pharmacokinetic and a  pharmacodynamic level.","2004-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","631-634","","8","26","","Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2004 Prous Science","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 15605124","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Drug Interactions; Rats, Wistar; Drug Combinations; Microsomes, Liver/enzymology; Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology; Microsomes/enzymology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/analysis/*metabolism; Behavior, Animal/drug effects; Nifedipine/*pharmacology; Brain/enzymology; Morphine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Morphine Dependence/*etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control; Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis/*metabolism; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Nitric Oxide Synthase/analysis/*metabolism; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*metabolism/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate the effect of prolonged  CWI with ropivacaine 0.2% (R) over seven days and methylprednisolone (Mp) 1 mg/kg  infused in the wound in the first 24 hours. METHODS: This is a randomized, double  blind, phase III trial (RCT) in major abdominal surgery with laparotomy.

We compared opioid  administration following preoperative intravenous (IV) or oral acetaminophen in  addition to a standard multimodal regimen to test the hypothesis that 1 loading  dose approach would provide superior opioid sparing effects among pediatric  surgical patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. METHODS: This  single-center, double-blind, double-dummy prospective randomized study was  conducted in patients ages 3 to 15 years undergoing tonsillectomy and  adenoidectomy with or without myringotomy and tube placement between September  2017 and July 2019. Subjects received 1 dose of either oral acetaminophen 30  mg/kg with IV placebo (oral group) or IV acetaminophen 15 mg/kg with oral placebo  (IV group). Acetaminophen plasma levels were measured at 2 timepoints to evaluate  safety and determine plasma levels attained by each dosing regimen.  Intraoperative opioid administration and postoperative analgesia were  standardized. Standardized postoperative multimodal analgesia included opioid if  needed to control pain assessed by standardized validated pediatric pain scales.  The primary outcome measure was total opioid administration in the first 24 hours  after surgery. Continuous data were not normally distributed and were analyzed  using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Hodges-Lehman estimator of the median  difference. Clinical significance was defined as a 100 µg/kg IV morphine  equivalents per day difference. RESULTS: Sixty-six subjects were randomized into  and completed the study (29 women, 37 men; age 5.9 ± 3.0 years; percentile weight  for age 49.5 ± 30.2; no differences between groups). There was no opioid dose  difference between oral (median 147.6; interquartile range [IQR], 119.6-193.0  µg/kg) and IV groups (median 125.4; IQR, 102.8-150.9 µg/kg; median difference  21.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.5 to 44.2 µg/kg IV morphine equivalents; P  = .13). No acetaminophen levels exceeded the predefined safety threshold (40  mg/L). No difference was found in the percentage of patients with severe pain:  50.0% oral group, 47.2% IV group; relative risk of severe pain in IV 0.94; 95%  CI, 0.57-1.6; P = .82. Postoperative plasma acetaminophen levels were higher in  oral (22; IQR, 16-28 mg/L) than IV (20; IQR, 17-22 mg/L) group (median difference  7.0; 4.0-8.0 mg/L; P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Opioid-sparing effects did not differ  following an oral or standard IV acetaminophen loading dose with no identified  acetaminophen toxicity in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy and  adenoidectomy who received standardized multimodal postoperative analgesia. An  oral loading dose may provide more consistent serum acetaminophen levels at lower  cost compared to a standard IV dose.","2021-12-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1568-1576","","6","133","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 International Anesthesia Research Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34304234","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Prospective Studies; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Administration, Intravenous; Treatment Outcome; Child; Child, Preschool; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy; Pain Management; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Morphine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Tonsillectomy/*adverse effects; Acetaminophen/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Adenoidectomy/*adverse effects; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mean doses during CI were the  morphine equivalent of 17 mg/hour (range, 0.7-100) at the start, 69 mg/hour  (range, 4-480) at the maximum, and 52 mg/hour (range, 1-480) at termination.

Sixty-two patients undergoing  elective knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (B) and  fentanyl were randomized to receive 0.2% B, 0.1% B, or placebo at 10 mL/h for 48  h after an initial bolus of 30 mL of the same solution via the femoral block  catheter. The catheters were inserted under the fascia iliaca using a ""double  pop"" technique and a peripheral nerve stimulator and were advanced 15-20 cm  cranially. Venous plasma levels of B, desbutylbupivacaine, and 4-hydroxy B were  measured daily for 3 days. All patients received patient-controlled analgesia  with morphine and indomethacin suppositories for 48 h. Using computed tomography,  we evaluated the catheter location for 20 patients. The catheter tips, located  superior to the upper third of the sacroiliac joint in the psoas sheath, were  labeled as ideally located. The group receiving 0.2% B had a larger block success  rate, smaller morphine consumption in the immediate postoperative period (15 vs  22 mg) and during the first postoperative day (9 vs 18 mg), and achieved a  greater range of motion in the immediate postoperative period (91 degrees +/- 10  degrees vs 80 degrees + 13 degrees ). Visual analog scores for pain during both  rest and activity were low but similar between the groups. Forty percent of the  catheters evaluated were ideally located. Ideal location and use of 0.2% B  resulted in 100% success of blockade of all three nerves. The S1 root was blocked  in up to 76% of patients. The plasma levels of B, 4-hydroxy B, and  desbutylbupivacaine were below the toxic range during the infusion. We conclude  that continuous fascia iliaca block with 0.2% B results in opioid-sparing and  improved range of motion during the immediate postoperative period. Larger doses  of bupivacaine may safely be used in the immediate postoperative period if  needed. IMPLICATIONS: Continuous fascia iliaca block with 0.2% bupivacaine  reduces opioid requirements and improves range of motion in the immediate  postoperative period compared with a placebo and 0.1% bupivacaine. Plasma levels  are below the toxic range with this dose. Only 40% of the catheters are  positioned in the ideal location. With the smaller dose of bupivacaine, the  success rate with this block is small.","1999-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1197-1202","","5","89","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10553834","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Pain Measurement; Analgesics, Opioid; Fentanyl; Morphine; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; *Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Anesthesia, Spinal; Anesthetics, Local/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Nerve Block/*methods; Pain, Postoperative/*therapy; Bupivacaine/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was also important to determine, as in other animals, if its  levels would change in response to stress. In this regard, it was also important  to determine if lobster immune and neural tissues express the mu opiate receptor  subtype, which was coupled to constitutive nitric oxide synthase derived nitric  oxide release. METHODS: Homarus americanus were used in these experiments.  Morphine was purified in lobster tissues via high pressure liquid chromatography  coupled to UV detection. It was quantified via radioimmunoassay (RIA) and was  identified via quadruple time of flight - mass spectrometry. Animals were subject  to 2 forms of trauma, namely pereiopod-ablation or lipopolysaccaride (LPS) -  injection, and morphine levels determined in nerve cord or hemolymph. Real-time  nitric oxide production was determined via an amperometric probe. RT-PCR was used  to determine the presence of a micro opiate receptor transcript. RESULTS: In  Homarus americanus hemolymph and nerve cord morphine was found. RIA revealed  morphine levels of 3.36 pg/mg +/ - 0.48 SEM (N=8) in nerve cord and 717.88 pg/ml  +/ - 56.77 SEM (N=58) in hemolymph. In stressed (pereiopod-ablated or  LPS-injected) animals, the endogenous morphine levels initially increased  significantly by 24% for hemolymph and 48% for nerve cord. By day 5, the stressed  and control values for endogenous morphine, in both tissues, was lower and  non-distinguishable. In both hemocytes and neural cells, morphine, not  met-enkephalin, stimulated constitutive nitric oxide release in a naloxone  antagonizable manner, demonstrating a mu opiate receptor mediated phenomenon and  suggesting the presence of the mu opiate receptor subtype, micro3, since it is  opiate alkaloid selective and opioid peptide insensitive. RT-PCR revealed the  presence of a micro opiate receptor transcript in Homarus neural and immune  tissues, which exhibits a 100% sequence identity with its human counterpart.  CONCLUSION: Taken together, after eliminating all sources of contamination,  morphine is present in lobster tissues, potentially demonstrating hormonal and  neurotransmitter functions that are involved in the animals' stress response.","2005-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","89-97","","2","26","","Neuro Endocrinol Lett","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Sweden PMID: 15855878","","","","Humans; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Base Sequence; Molecular Sequence Data; Tissue Distribution; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Nitric Oxide/*metabolism; Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism; Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism; Nephropidae/*metabolism; RNA/analysis; Stress, Physiological/*metabolism; Morphine/*metabolism; Hemolymph/metabolism; Nervous System/metabolism; Receptors, Invertebrate Peptide/genetics/metabolism; Receptors, Opioid, mu/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies in rats, mice, and sheep  demonstrate activation of spinal cholinergic neurons by systemic opioid  administration, and participation of this cholinergic activity in opioid-induced  analgesia. Testing the relevance of this observation in humans has been limited  to measurement of acetylcholine spillover into lumbar cerebrospinal fluid. The  purpose of this study was to apply a recently developed method to image spinal  cholinergic terminals non-invasively via PET and to test the hypothesis that the  tracer utilized would reflect changes in local cholinergic activity. Following  Animal Care and Use Committee approval, seven adult male rhesus monkeys were  anesthetized on three separate occasions. On two of the occasions PET scans were  performed using [(18)F] (+)-4-fluorobenzyltrozamicol ([(18)F]FBT), which  selectively binds to the vesicular acetylcholine (ACh) transporter in the  presynaptic cholinergic terminals. PET scans were preceded by injection of either  saline or an analgesic dose of IV morphine (10 mg/kg). On the third occasion,  microdialysis catheters were inserted in the spinal cord dorsal horn and  acetylcholine concentrations in dialysates determined before and after IV  morphine injection. Morphine increased cholinergic activity in the spinal cord,  as determined by blood flow corrected distribution volume of [(18)F]FBT in the  cervical cord compared to the cerebellum. Morphine also increased acetylcholine  concentrations in microdialysates from the cervical cord dorsal horn. The one  animal which did not show increased spinal cholinergic activity by PET from this  dose of morphine also did not show increased acetylcholine from this morphine  dose in the microdialysis experiment. These data confirm the ability to use PET  to image spinal cholinergic terminals in the monkey spinal cord and suggest that  acute changes in cholinergic activity can be imaged with this non-invasive  technique. Following preclinical screening, PET scanning with [(18)F]FBT may be  useful to investigate mechanisms of analgesic action in normal humans and in  those with pain.","2001-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","139-145","","1-2","91","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11240086","","","","Male; Animals; Piperidines/pharmacokinetics; Macaca mulatta; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Fluorobenzenes/pharmacokinetics; Microdialysis; Regional Blood Flow/drug effects; Fluorine Radioisotopes; Acetylcholine/metabolism; Morphine/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Cholinergic Fibers/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects/*physiology; Spinal Cord/blood supply/*drug effects/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, invertebrate neural tissues  incubated with ethanol, cocaine, or nicotine results in a statistically  significant enhancement of labeled morphine release. We now demonstrate that this  also occurs with human WBC. MATERIAL/METHODS: Human blood was obtained from the  Long Island Blood Services (Melville, NY). Polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) or  mononuclear cells (MN) (10 million/ml) were bathed in phosphate buffered saline  (PBS) medium containing purified RIA grade 125I-labeled morphine for trace  labeling and quantification of media concentrations of morphine were via RIA.  Cells were then incubated with cocaine, alcohol or nicotine and morphine release  was determined. Residual levels of radioactivity in control tissues were always  greater than 65% of total cpm, whereas in treated tissue differences depended on  the amount of drug added. RESULTS: Incorporation rates of 125I-labeled morphine  into PMN and MN were 7.85+/-0.36% and 1.42+/-0.19%, respectively. Separate  incubations of PMN with ethanol, cocaine, or nicotine resulted in a statistically  significant enhancement of 125I-labeled morphine released into the extracellular  medium in a concentration dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These substances of  abuse have been linked into a common pathway because of the common dopamine  connection. Now, they are additionally linked because of their common effect on  endogenous morphinergic processes. It is highly significant that these substances  of abuse converge on a similar process, providing a mechanism to initiate their  pleasure and addicting actions with continued frequent use.","2006-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","BR350-354","","11","12","","Med Sci Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17072263","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Radioimmunoassay; Nicotine/*pharmacology; Leukocytes/*drug effects/metabolism; Neutrophils/cytology; Cocaine/*pharmacology; Morphine/*pharmacokinetics; Substance-Related Disorders/metabolism; Alcohols/*pharmacology; Iodine Radioisotopes/pharmacology; Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the risks and side effects of opioid medications are well  documented. Oliceridine is a novel opioid receptor agonist which is thought to  have less risk of adverse events, such as postoperative nausea and vomiting  (PONV) and respiratory depression. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors  discuss the limitations of the current opioid and non-opioid analgesic options.  They also review the pharmacokinetics of oliceridine, its analgesic efficacy, and  risk of adverse events; and its added clinical value in managing moderate to  severe pain. EXPERT OPINION: Despite the advances in regional anesthesia and  multimodal systemic analgesia, opioid free analgesia is only feasible in selected  procedures and patients. Oliceridine is effective in the management of moderate  to severe pain and appears to be associated with lower risk of nausea and  vomiting. The risk of sedation and respiratory depression associated with  oliceridine will require further study. The availability of an opioid agonist  with a better side effect profile could potentially change the current paradigm  of opioid avoidance in postoperative pain management.","2022-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","9-17","","1","23","","Expert Opin Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 34534033","","","","Adult; Humans; opioids; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects; Thiophenes; Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy; pain; anesthesia; *Morphine; *Acute Pain/drug therapy; Oliceridine; post-operative pain; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting; Spiro Compounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Encapsulation of drugs in  multivesicular lipid-based particles for sustained release is a novel approach to  improving the pharmacokinetics of drug therapy. This paper reviews the  preclinical and clinical literature on the applications and potential therapeutic  benefits of DepoFoam technology, a novel sustained-release, injectable drug  delivery system. DepoFoam formulations of drugs, including anticancer agents  (cytarabine, methotrexate, bleomycin, recombinant interferon alfa,  5-fluorouridine-5'-monophosphate, and others), anti-infective agents  (dideoxycytidine, 2'-norcyclic guanosine monophosphate, cidofovir, tobramycin,  gentamicin, amikacin), analgesics (morphine, bupivacaine), and macromolecules  (insulin, interleukin-2), delivered intrathecally, subcutaneously,  intraperitoneally, or intralesionally, provide sustained therapeutic levels of  drug at the intended target site and reduce systemic exposure and toxicity.  Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that DepoFoam particle encapsulation  effectively extends the half-life of drugs, thus prolonging the duration of  therapeutic drug concentrations in local tissues or in body spaces into which the  encapsulated drug is injected. In the case of cell-cycle phase-specific  chemotherapeutic agents, such formulations can improve efficacy and therapeutic  ratio. DepoFoam is a promising drug delivery system for sustained release of  hydrophilic injectable drugs that has a wide range of potential applications in  oncology, infectious disease, analgesia, and other therapeutic areas.","2001-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","219-227","","3","7","","Cancer J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11419030","","","","Humans; Cytarabine/*administration & dosage; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage; Morphine/administration & dosage; Delayed-Action Preparations/*administration & dosage; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage; Methotrexate/*administration & dosage; Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is mainly metabolised by glucuronidation, but minor pathways are  N-demethylation to norcodeine and O-demethylation to morphine. The latter pathway  depends on the genetically polymorphic CYP2D6 which is absent in 7% of the white  population (PM) and present in the remainder (EM). Lack of influence of codeine  on experimental pain in PM as well as in EM treated with the CYP2D6 blocker  quinidine, who are both practically unable to convert codeine to morphine, has  supported an old hypothesis that codeine acts through metabolically formed  morphine. Possibly, local codeine O-demethylation in the CNS is of major  importance for its hypoalgesic effect. Such a local morphine formation from  codeine, which supposedly is also catalysed by CYP2D6, could explain why the  hypoalgesic effect of codeine stems from morphine despite relatively low plasma  levels of morphine after standard hypoalgesic doses of codeine. Dependence of  codeine hypoalgesia on morphine formation via CYP2D6 makes this effect liable to  interaction with drugs that are inhibitors of CYP2D6. Examples of potent  inhibitors of CYP2D6 are quinidine, some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and some neuroleptics. Less potent inhibitors, such as tricyclic antidepressants,  will probably also reduce the pain relieving effect of codeine, since codeine has  a low affinity for CYP2D6. Biosynthesis of morphine in humans may also include  steps catalyse by CYP2D6. Experimental studies in large groups of EM and PM  indicate that this may lead to interphenotype differences in pain tolerance.","1995-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","335-346","","6","5","","Pharmacogenetics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8845855","","","","Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenotype; Drug Interactions; Polymorphism, Genetic; Pharmacogenetics; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6; Debrisoquin/metabolism; Sparteine/metabolism; Mixed Function Oxygenases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism; Pain/drug therapy; Morphine/metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Codeine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Pain Threshold/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ANIMALS: 6 healthy  adult great horned owls (3 females and 3 males). PROCEDURES: A single dose of  hydromorphone (0.6 mg/kg) was administered once IM (pectoral muscles) and IV  (left jugular) with a 6-week washout period between experiments. Blood samples  were collected at 5 minutes and 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after drug  administration. Plasma hydromorphone and H3G concentrations were determined with  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and a noncompartmental analysis  was used for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS:  Hydromorphone had a high bioavailability of 170.8 ± 37.6% and rapid elimination  after IM administration and rapid plasma clearance and a large volume of  distribution after IV administration. Mean Cmax was 225.46 ± 0.2 ng/mL at 13  minutes after IM injection. Mean volume of distribution and plasma drug clearance  was 4.29 ± 0.5 L/kg and 62.11 ± 14.6 mL/min/kg, respectively, after IV  administration. Mean t1/2 was 1.62 ± 0.36 and 1.35 ± 0.59 hours after IM and IV  administration, respectively. The metabolite H3G was readily measured shortly  after administration by both routes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A single dose of 0.6  mg/kg was well tolerated in all birds. Hydromorphone rapidly attained plasma  concentrations following IM administration and had high bioavailability and short  t1/2. This study is the first to document the presence of the metabolite H3G in  avian species, which suggests similar hydromorphone metabolism as in mammals.","2023-05-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","ajvr.22.12.0218","","5","84","","Am J Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36881501","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Biological Availability; Injections, Intravenous/veterinary; Mammals; Administration, Intravenous/veterinary; Injections, Intramuscular/veterinary; *Hydromorphone/pharmacokinetics; *Strigiformes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extracellular recording from LC neurons in brain slices from animals  implanted with either morphine or placebo pellets established that the tolerant  preparations were subsensitive to both morphine and muscimol. Immunocytochemical  analysis identified the alpha(3)-subunit as the primary isoform of the Na(+)/K(+)  pump in the cells under investigation. Whole-cell patch clamp recording of  neurons in brain slices demonstrated that, with electrodes containing 20 mM Na(+)  (approximating [Na](i)), tolerant cells were significantly depolarized by a mean  of 6.7 mV. Dialysis with antibody specific for the alpha(3)-isoform from patch  pipettes produced depolarization of both control and tolerant cells. However, the  depolarizing effect of the antibody was less in tolerant cells, suggesting a  lesser degree of electrogenic Na(+) pumping. Furthermore, the presence of  antibody reduced the membrane potentials of tolerant and placebo cells to equal  values, suggesting that the diffusion potentials were not different. In contrast,  antibody specific for the alpha(1)-subunit isoform in the pipettes had no effect  on membrane potential in either control or tolerant cells. In conclusion, both  hypotheses were supported.","2001-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","909-916","","3","298","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11504784","","","","Male; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Immunohistochemistry; Guinea Pigs; Microscopy, Confocal; Drug Tolerance; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Neurons/*drug effects; Membrane Potentials/drug effects; Drug Implants; Tissue Fixation; Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacology; GABA Agonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Locus Coeruleus/*cytology/drug effects; Muscimol/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Narcotics/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the  concentration-response curve for GABA-induced 36Cl- uptake (GABA 3-100 microM)  was shifted to the right both by naloxone and morphine (1,000 microM).

Its biosynthetic precursor codeine is currently the most widely used  and effective antitussive agent. Along the morphine biosynthetic pathway in opium  poppy, codeinone reductase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of codeinone  to codeine. In this study, we have isolated and characterized four cDNAs encoding  codeinone reductase isoforms and have functionally expressed them in Escherichia  coli. Heterologously expressed codeinone reductase-calmodulin-binding peptide  fusion protein was purified from E. coli using calmodulin affinity column  chromatography in a yield of 10 mg enzyme l-1. These four isoforms demonstrated  very similar physical properties and substrate specificity. As least six alleles  appear to be present in the poppy genome. A comparison of the translations of the  nucleotide sequences indicate that the codeinone reductase isoforms are 53%  identical to 6'-deoxychalcone synthase from soybean suggesting an evolutionary  although not a functional link between enzymes of phenylpropanoid and alkaloid  biosynthesis. By sequence comparison, both codeinone reductase and 6'-deoxy-  chalcone synthase belong to the aldo/keto reductase family, a group of  structurally and functionally related NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases, and  thereby possibly arise from primary metabolism.","1999-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:57:06","","465-475","","5","18","","Plant J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Unterlinner1999a PMID: 10417697 place: England","","","","Substrate Specificity; Species Specificity; Alleles; Molecular Sequence Data; Amino Acid Sequence; Tissue Distribution; Polymerase Chain Reaction; *Plants, Medicinal; Cloning, Molecular; Models, Chemical; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; DNA, Complementary/genetics; Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics; Morphine/*metabolism; Alcohol Oxidoreductases/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification; Genes, Plant; NAD (+) and NADP (+) Dependent Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Papaver/*genetics; RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification; RNA, Plant/genetics/isolation & purification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Level 1 consisted of continuous  administration of sufentanil, in level 2 continuous administration of midazolam  and level 3 continuous administration of midazolam and clonidine was added  according to patients' needs. METHODS: Sufentanil at 1 microgram/kg/h was given  initially. Later it was adjusted to patients' requirements in accordance with the  Ramsay score (group 1). Long-term intubated patients received in addition  midazolam 0.05 mg/kg/h (group 2). If needed, clonidine 1 microgram/kg/h was added  (group 3). Mean drug requirements were investigated during controlled ventilation  and during assisted ventilation with spontaneous breathing > 25% of total minute  ventilation. In group 1 arterial paCO2 was measured to estimate drug-induced  respiratory depression. Values given are median and ranges. RESULTS: With the  3-level-regimen of analgesia and sedation a Ramsay score of 2-3 was achieved in  all intensive-care patients. In group 1 (n = 109; 36.7%) paCO2 values were  similar at all times. Patients on controlled ventilation needed sufentanil 0.6  (0.075-2.5) microgram/kg/h, on assisted ventilation 0.4 (0.05-2.5)  microgram/kg/h. Patients of group 2 (n = 113; 38.1%) had on controlled  ventilation a higher requirement of sufentanil 1.2 (0.09-2.7) micrograms/kg/h, in  addition Midazolam 0.05 (0.002-0.56) mg/kg/h was given. On assisted ventilation  with spontaneous breathing > 25% sufentanil 0.9 (0.05-2.6) microgram/kg/h plus  midazolam 0.04 (0.002-0.38) mg/kg/h was sufficient. Group 3 (n = 75; 25.2%) had  on controlled ventilation a higher requirement of sufentanil with 1.5 (0.09-4.0)  micrograms/kg/h and midazolam 0.05 (0.005-0.52) mg/kg/h, in addition clonidine  1.1 (0.12-2.88) micrograms/kg/h was given. On assisted ventilation with  spontaneous breathing > 25% requirement of sufentanil with 1.1 (0.15-2.6)  micrograms/kg/h and of midazolam with 0.05 (0.002-0.22) mg/kg/h was slightly  lower, whereas more clonidine was needed with 1.3 (0.12-2.88) micrograms/kg/h.  CONCLUSION: Continuous infusion of sufentanil only for analgesia and sedation is  suitable for intensive-care patients with a short stay in the ICU. Respiratory  depression during spontaneous breathing is not significant. The supplementary  administration of midazolam and clonidine according to the presented regimen was  shown to be of advantage for patients with a longer stay in ICU.","1998-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","8-26","","1","33","","Anasthesiol Intensivmed Notfallmed Schmerzther","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 9530479","","","","Humans; Respiration; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Infusions, Intravenous; Retrospective Studies; Intubation; Respiration, Artificial; *Critical Care; Carbon Dioxide/blood; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Hypnotics and Sedatives/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Morphine/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Fentanyl/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Alfentanil/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Clonidine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Midazolam/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Sufentanil/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Sympatholytics/administration & dosage/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although conventional antipsychotics are often used to  counter emesis, they can be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms. However,  chronic pain can induce sleep disturbance. The authors investigated the effects  of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine on morphine-induced emesis and the sleep  dysregulation associated with chronic pain. METHODS: A receptor binding assay was  performed using mouse whole brain tissue. The emetic response in ferrets was  evaluated by counting retching and vomiting behaviors. Catalepsy in mice was  evaluated by placing both of their forepaws over a horizontal bar. Released  dopamine was measured by an in vivo microdialysis study. Sleep disturbance in  mice in a neuropathic pain-like state was assayed by electroencephalogram and  electromyogram recordings. RESULTS: Olanzapine showed high affinity for  muscarinic M1 receptor in brain tissue. Olanzapine decreased morphine-induced  nausea and vomiting in a dose-dependent manner. However, olanzapine at a dose  that had an antiemetic effect (0.03 mg/kg) did not induce catalepsy or  hyperglycemia. In addition, olanzapine at this dose had no effect on the  morphine-induced release of dopamine or inhibition of gastrointestinal transit.  Finally, olanzapine inhibited thermal hyperalgesia and completely alleviated the  sleep disturbance induced by sciatic nerve ligation. CONCLUSION: These findings  suggest that olanzapine may be useful for the treatment of morphine-induced  emesis and as an adjunct for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with  sleep disturbance.","2012-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:58:56","","159-169","","1","116","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Torigoe2012a PMID: 22126917 place: United States","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Electroencephalography/drug effects; Drug Therapy, Combination; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Olanzapine; Microdialysis; Pain Management; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Gastrointestinal Transit/drug effects; Dopamine/metabolism; Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Brain Chemistry/drug effects; Morphine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Benzodiazepines/*therapeutic use; Catalepsy/chemically induced/psychology; Clozapine/pharmacokinetics; Electromyography/drug effects; Hyperalgesia/prevention & control; Neuralgia/complications/*drug therapy; Receptors, Serotonin/metabolism; Sciatica/prevention & control; Sleep Wake Disorders/drug therapy/etiology; Vomiting/chemically induced/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After RII of a number of compounds in  volumes that exceeded the maximum distended capacity of the biliary tree, only  that volume of RII solution which corresponded to biliary tree capacity remained  therein. Furthermore, this latter portion of RII solution was absorbed by a  first-order process when the duration of bile duct cannula occlusion was  extended. Thus, the present study demonstrates that absorption of retrogradely  injected compounds continues during occlusion. Since excretion of i.v.  administered compounds into the biliary system was also shown to continue during  occlusion, we propose in the present study a concept of bidirectional exchange of  solute within the biliary tree during occlusion. As an additional finding, after  RII and occlusion, a temporary increase in bile flow was obtained. If the  occlusion duration was 3 minutes or less, the bile flow response was of  sufficient magnitude to repay alomst exactly the volume of bile that would have  been expected to be produced. If the occlusion was 6 and 9 minutes the increased  magnitude of the bile flow response was not great enough to repary the larger  bile volumes expected and underpayments of -48 and -96 mul were incurred.","1975-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","126-134","","1","194","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1151745","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Tritium; Carbon Radioisotopes; Pharmaceutical Preparations/administration & dosage/*metabolism; Absorption; Biliary Tract/*metabolism; Sulfobromophthalein/metabolism; Urea/metabolism; Inulin/metabolism; Aminohippuric Acids/metabolism; Mannitol/metabolism; Erythritol/metabolism; Ouabain/metabolism; Tetraethylammonium Compounds/metabolism; Morphine/metabolism; Injections/*methods; Methanol/metabolism; Procainamide/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Covariate influences such as age, size, and fat mass on  oxycodone pharmacokinetic parameters over the human lifespan are poorly  quantified. METHODS: Pooled oxycodone time-concentration profiles were available  from preterm neonates to adults. Data from intravenous, intramuscular, buccal,  and epidural formulations were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects models.  Normal fat mass was used to determine the influence of fat on oxycodone  pharmacokinetics. Theory-based allometry was used to scale pharmacokinetic  parameters to a 70 kg individual. A maturation function described the increase in  clearance in neonates and infants. RESULTS: There were 237 subjects (24 weeks  postmenstrual age to 75 years; 0.44-110 kg) providing 1317 plasma concentrations.  A three-compartment model with first-order elimination best described oxycodone  disposition. Population parameter estimates were clearance (CL) 48.6 L.h(-1)  .70 kg(-1) (CV 71%); intercompartmental clearances (Q2) 220 L.h(-1) .70 kg(-1)  (CV 64%); Q3 1.45 L.h(-1) .70 kg(-1) ; volume of distribution in the central  compartment (V1) 98.2 L.70 kg(-1) (CV 76%); rapidly equilibrating peripheral  compartment (V2) 90.1 L. 70 kg(-1) (CV 76%); slow equilibrating peripheral  compartment (V3) 28.9 L.70 kg(-1) . Total body weight was the best size  descriptor for clearances and volumes. Absorption halftimes (T(ABS) ) were:  1.1 minutes for intramuscular, 70 minutes for epidural, 82 minutes for  nasogastric, and 159.6 minutes for buccal administration routes. The relative  bioavailability after nasogastric administration was 0.673 with a lag time of  8.7 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Clearance matured with age; 8% of the typical adult  value at 24 weeks postmenstrual age, 33% in a term neonate and reached 90% of the  adult clearance value by the end of the first year of life. Allometric scaling  using total body weight was the better size descriptor of oxycodone clearance  than fat-free mass.","2021-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1332-1339","","12","31","","Paediatr Anaesth","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 34469607","","","","Adult; Humans; Models, Biological; pharmacokinetics; Administration, Intravenous; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Child; Nonlinear Dynamics; Infant; Infant, Newborn; children; oxycodone; analgesia; pain; *Oxycodone/therapeutic use; *Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy; clearance maturation; nonlinear mixed-effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As has been shown for heroin, knowledge of the state of  distribution and elimination of active and inactive metabolites and glucuronides  offers new possibilities in forensic interpretation of analytic results. Because  of similar metabolic degradation, calculation of the time-dependent ratio of the  concentration of morphine and its glucuronide metabolites in blood or serum  allows a rough estimation of increased dosage and of time elapsed since the last  application. Drug effects can be examined with respect to individual case  histories, including overdose and survival time if the patient died. However,  different methods of administration and the strong influence of different volumes  or compartments of distribution of parent compounds and metabolites on  concentrations in human body tissues require careful use of glucuronide  concentration data. In Germany, dihydrocodeine (DHC) is prescribed as a heroin  substitute, and relative overdoses are needed to be effective. DHC metabolism was  studied in three patients who died from overdoses. All metabolites  (dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide [DHC6], nor-DHC [NDHC], dihydromorphine [DHM],  nor-DHM [NDHM], and DHM-3- and 6-glucuronide [DHM3G, DHM6G]) were determined  using HPLC and fluorescence detection. Concentrations of DHM (0.16 mg/L to 0.22  mg/L serum) were found. The DHM glucuronide ratios were similar to those of  morphine. Receptor binding studies showed that the binding affinity of DHM to  porcine mu-receptor was higher than that of morphine, and DHM6G's binding  affinity was as high as that of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Metabolites may  play an important role in the effectiveness of DHC in substitution and toxicity.  Because of enzyme polymorphism, the formation of DHC poses a risk for proper  dosage in patients who are either poor or extensive metabolizers. The  distribution of opioid glucuronides in cerebral spinal fluid in relation to  transcellular transport in central nervous tissue is discussed with respect to  the receptor binding of opiates and drug effect.","1998-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","561-569","","5","20","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9780136","","","","Humans; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Overdose; Toxicology/methods; Analgesics, Opioid/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Narcotics/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Codeine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; Heroin/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have reported previously that prenatal morphine exposure  induced a severe atrophy of the adrenals and a decrease of corticosterone release  in newborn rats at birth and during the early postnatal period. The first aim of  the present study was to determine the effects of prenatal morphine exposure (1)  on corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) content of the hypothalamus, CRF  immunofluorescence in the median eminence, CRF mRNA in the paraventricular  nucleus (PVN) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA in the anterior pituitary  gland; (2) on CRF-induced ACTH release from the anterior pituitary gland in  vitro; and (3) on ACTH-induced corticosterone release by the adrenals in vitro.  Moreover, as morphine is a hepatotoxic factor, we determined the effects of  prenatal morphine on liver weight and plasma corticosteroid binding globulin  (CBG) binding capacity in newborn rats. Since acute administration of morphine  stimulates corticosterone secretion in adult rats and since maternal  corticosterone can cross the placental barrier, we also measured both adrenal  weight and glucocorticoid activity in newborns from adrenalectomized mothers  treated with morphine. The present results show that prenatal morphine given to  intact mothers induced adrenal atrophy and hypoactivity in newborns but did not  affect the responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland to CRF or that of the  adrenal gland to ACTH. Prenatal morphine reduced both CRF content in the newborn  hypothalamus and CRF immunofluorescence in the median eminence without a  significant effect on CRF mRNA expression in the PVN. Moreover, morphine induced  a significant decrease of POMC mRNA in the anterior pituitary gland. However,  morphine did not significantly affect the weight of the liver, or the plasma CBG  binding capacity for corticosterone, in rat pups. In contrast, morphine treatment  of the adrenalectomized mothers did not induce adrenal atrophy in newborns and  did not impair adrenal activation during the early postnatal period. Maternal  adrenalectomy also prevented the effects of prenatal morphine on hypothalamic  content of CRF, CRF immunofluorescence in the median eminence, and POMC mRNA in  the anterior pituitary gland. However, adrenal atrophy was observed at term in  newborns of adrenalectomized mothers treated with both morphine and  corticosterone or only corticosterone. In conclusion, morphine given to pregnant  rats induced inhibition of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in pups at  term. As maternal adrenalectomy prevented these effects, we speculate that an  adrenal factor of maternal origin, probably corticosterone, mediated these drug  effects on newborns.","1998-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","331-342","","5","10","","J Neuroendocrinol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9663647","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Tissue Distribution; Pregnancy; Brain/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Adrenal Glands/drug effects/metabolism; Adrenalectomy; *Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Animals, Newborn/*physiology; Maternal-Fetal Exchange/physiology; Morphine/*pharmacology; Corticosterone/blood/metabolism; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/genetics/metabolism; Cosyntropin/pharmacology; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects; Pituitary-Adrenal System/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum testosterone, testicular interstitial fluid (TIF)  testosterone, and TIF volumes were measured to assess testicular function.  Naltrexone induced dose-dependent increases in serum and TIF testosterone levels  without changes in TIF volume. Alcohol (0.5 g/kg) inhibited naltrexone-induced  stimulation of testosterone secretion and shifted the naltrexone dose-response  curve to the right. Conversely, naltrexone (0.05 mg/kg) inhibited alcohol-induced  suppression of testosterone secretion and shifted the alcohol dose-response curve  to the right. Relatively high doses of naltrexone (5 to 30 mg/kg) were needed to  stimulate testosterone secretion maximally in rats treated with a low dose of  alcohol (0.5 g/kg) and to stimulate normal levels of testosterone secretion in  rats treated with a high dose of alcohol (2 g/kg). In addition, combined  treatment with 1 and 30 mg/kg of naltrexone and 0.5 to 2 g/kg of alcohol did not  alter blood alcohol concentrations significantly, suggesting that the  interactions between alcohol and naltrexone were unrelated to gross changes in  alcohol metabolism or bioavailability factors. Simultaneous treatments with a low  dose of alcohol (0.3 g/kg), near the threshold of efficacy, and low-moderate  doses of morphine (0.3 to 3 mg/kg) were not additive in suppressing testosterone  secretion, compared with either agent alone. These results support the hypothesis  that opioid antagonists can reverse the suppressive effect of alcohol on  testicular steroidogenesis, but the results also suggest that endogenous opioids  do not exclusively mediate alcohol's effects on testosterone secretion.","1997-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","684-690","","4","21","","Alcohol Clin Exp Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 9194925","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Testosterone/*blood; Luteinizing Hormone/blood; Ethanol/pharmacokinetics; Morphine/pharmacology; Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology; Naltrexone/pharmacology; Alcoholism/*physiopathology; Opioid Peptides/*physiology; Testis/*drug effects/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drug therapy can be  affected pharmacokinetically by polyaromatic hydrocarbons and pharmacodynamically  by nicotine. Pentazocine and phenylbutazone show increased metabolism in smokers  and may have to be given in higher dosages. Smokers experience less pain relief  with propoxyphene than do nonsmokers. Codeine, meperidine, and morphine are  unaffected pharmacokinetically, and the effect on acetaminophen is probably not  clinically important. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital are not  influenced. Heparin metabolism is elevated in smokers; this effect may  necessitate modest increases in dosage. Warfarin clearance is increased, but this  is not associated with a change in prothrombin time. Pindolol and propranolol are  unaffected pharmacokinetically, but direct effects of nicotine may interfere with  blood pressure control. Smoking transiently diminishes the diuretic effect of  furosemide, inconsistently affects protein binding of lidocaine, and has no  effect on prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone. The metabolism of estrogens  to less active metabolites is increased. Smoking is associated with decreased  subcutaneous absorption of insulin and increased dosage requirements. Healing of  GI ulcers with histamine H2-receptor antagonists may be compromised in smokers;  sucralfate is probably more useful. Imipramine, benzodiazepines, chlorpromazine,  and glutethimide may be influenced, and theophylline metabolism is accelerated.

The methamphetamine and morphine  concentrations in the lung were 2 to 4 times higher than those in cardiac blood  samples. In the third case, autopsy of whom was performed approximately 2.5 days  after death, the pulmonary veins and arteries were filled with chicken fat clots.  Toxicological examination revealed the presence of four basic drugs:  methamphetamine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline and promethazine. Their  concentrations in the lung were 5 to 300 times higher than those in cardiac  blood, but postmortem increases in the concentrations of these drugs in the  cardiac blood were not observed. In the animal experiments, rabbits were given 5  mg/kg methamphetamine intravenously or 20 mg/kg amitriptyline subcutaneously and  sacrificed 20 min or 1 h later, respectively. The carcasses were left in a supine  position at the ambient temperature for 6 h after or without ligation of the  large vessels around the heart. For the groups with ligated vessels, the mean  ratios of the drug concentrations in both left and right cardiac blood samples 6  to 0 h postmortem were about 1, whereas in those without ligated vessels, these  ratios were about 2 and 1, respectively. The order of the methamphetamine and  amitriptyline concentrations in blood and tissue samples were roughly: lungs >  myocardium and pulmonary venous blood > cardiac blood, inferior vena caval blood  and liver. Our results demonstrate that when bodies are in a supine position, (1)  basic drugs in the lungs diffuse rapidly postmortem into the left cardiac  chambers via the pulmonary venous blood rather than simply diffusing across  concentration gradients, and (2) basic drugs in the myocardium contribute little  to the increases in their concentrations in cardiac blood during the early  postmortem period.","1999-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","10-16","","1","44","","J Forensic Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9987864","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Animals; Rabbits; Tissue Distribution; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Chromatography, Gas; *Coronary Circulation; Autopsy; Drug Overdose; *Postmortem Changes; Morphine/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Amitriptyline/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Central Nervous System Stimulants/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Histamine H1 Antagonists/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Illicit Drugs/blood/*pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Methamphetamine/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Narcotics/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning; Nortriptyline/blood/pharmacokinetics; Promethazine/blood/pharmacokinetics/poisoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence suggests a probable supraspinal action of morphine in altering  immune function, although the role of spinal systems have not been evaluated.  Therefore, this study compared the effect of equianalgesic doses of subcutaneous  and intrathecal morphine on lymphocyte proliferative responses and phenotypic  expression of lymphocyte cell surface markers in rats. METHODS: Equianalgesic  doses of subcutaneous (10 mg/kg) or intrathecal (30 micrograms, by a chronic  intrathecal catheter) morphine were given twice for 5 h (time 0 and 2.5 h).  Immediately after the 5-h period or 24 h after the initial injection, spleens  were harvested and lymphocytes isolated. Mitogen-induced (phytohemagglutinin,  concanavalin A, pokeweed, lipopolysaccharide) lymphocyte proliferation and  monoclonal antibody labeling of cell surface markers (T cell, B cell, CD4+, CD8+)  were then performed. RESULTS: Subcutaneous morphine acutely suppressed lymphocyte  proliferation to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed, and concanavalin A by  37%, 21%, and 20% respectively; however, proliferative responses returned to  baseline within 24 h. Morphine treatment did not alter the response to  lipopolysaccharide. The number of splenic lymphocytes also decreased, whereas the  percentage of lymphocytes expressing the CD4+ marker (T helper/inducer cells)  modestly increased. Intrathecal morphine did not alter lymphocyte proliferative  responses, nor did it change phenotypic expression of cell surface markers.  CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous morphine inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, decreased  splenic lymphocyte number, and altered phenotypic expression of cell surface  markers, whereas equianalgesic doses of intrathecal morphine did not. Although  these results suggest that spinal opioids may have theoretical benefits for the  analgesic management of immunocompromised patients, further studies are clearly  indicated.","1996-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","355-365","","2","85","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8712452","","","","Male; Phenotype; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Therapeutic Equivalency; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Injections, Spinal; Morphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Injections, Subcutaneous; Mitogens/*pharmacology; Partial Pressure; Carbon Dioxide/blood; B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology; CD4 Antigens/*analysis; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/immunology; CD8 Antigens/*analysis; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/immunology; Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/immunology; Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects; Spleen/cytology/drug effects/immunology; T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study evaluated the  influence of behavioral processes on the development of tolerance and  cross-tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of chlordiazepoxide in rats.  Sprague-Dawley rats responded under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food delivery.  Different groups of rats received 18 mg/kg/day of chlordiazepoxide either before  (PRE, n = 8) or after (POST, n = 10) daily experimental sessions for 8 weeks.  Cumulative dose-response curves for chlordiazepoxide were obtained before and  during chronic chlordiazepoxide administration and during chronic saline  administration. Cumulative dose-response curves for midazolam, FG 7142  (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) flumazenil, pentobarbital, caffeine,  morphine and d-amphetamine were determined before, during and 4.5 to 5 months  after chronic chlordiazepoxide administration. Group PRE developed tolerance to  chlordiazepoxide, whereas group POST did not develop tolerance. Although  cross-tolerance developed to midazolam in both groups, it was greater in group  PRE. Both groups showed comparable sensitization to FG7142 and neither group  showed a significant change in sensitivity to any of the other drugs. Biochemical  studies of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related functioning in groups of rats  that received chronic chlordiazepoxide administration either before (BIO-PRE, n =  6) or after (BIO-POST, n = 6) daily sessions found that GABA-stimulated  36Cl-uptake increased in both cortical and cerebellar preparations. However, GABA  sensitivity in cerebellar tissue was significantly lower in group BIO-PRE  compared with group BIO-POST. Thus, behavioral tolerance to chlordiazepoxide was  associated with both pharmacological and biochemical effects, which suggests a  relationship between behavioral tolerance to benzodiazepines and changes in the  functional state of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.","1993-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1311-1320","","3","267","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8263795","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Sensitivity and Specificity; Caffeine/pharmacology; Drug Tolerance; Stimulation, Chemical; Midazolam/pharmacology; Behavior, Animal/*drug effects; Radioisotopes; Chlorine/pharmacokinetics; Chlorides/pharmacokinetics; Morphine/pharmacology; Pentobarbital/pharmacology; Amphetamine/pharmacology; Chlordiazepoxide/*pharmacology; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/pharmacology; Carbolines/pharmacology; Flumazenil/pharmacology; Receptors, GABA-A/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these experiments, the drugs were used  before s.c. injection of naloxone (2 mg/kg), to test their effects on the  expression of jumping. The i.c.v. administration of histamine (5-20 microg/mouse)  15 min before naloxone injection decreased the number of jumps in mice. When the  histamine H(2) receptor antagonist, cimetidine (5-20 mg/kg), and the histamine  H(1) receptor antagonist, pyrilamine (5-20 mg/kg), were administered i.p. to  morphine-dependent mice, only cimetidine enhanced the jumping behaviour.  Administration of cimetidine (20 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min, of the beta-adrenoceptor  antagonist, propranolol (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.), 15 min but not of pyrilamine (20  mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before naloxone injection, decreased the histamine effect.  The i.p. administration of an acetylcholine receptor antagonist, atropine (5 and  10 mg/kg, i.p.), the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.5, 1 and 2  mg/kg, i.p.), and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.5, 1 and 2  mg/kg, i.p.), 15 min before naloxone injection, had no effect on the histamine  response.

In contrast,  naloxone fails to increase serum LH in the prepubescent male rat but, coincident  with the onset of puberty (30-35 days of age), the antagonist becomes  increasingly more effective until adult appropriate responses are achieved at  sexual maturation. The purpose of the present studies was to examine and  characterize further the dichotomous response to naloxone and morphine in the  prepubescent male rat. We found that the inability of naloxone to affect a  release in LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) was not related to pharmacokinetic factors  as the dose and time-response characteristics were identical in young and adult  animals. In addition, our results indicated that the release of LHRH and its  actions on the pituitary to promote LH release were equivalent in prepubescent  and adult rats, indicating that if naloxone was capable of releasing LHRH then  robust increases in LH should have occurred. Our results indicate further that  the ineffectiveness of naloxone in prepubescent animals was not unique to this  compound inasmuch as kappa antagonists also were devoid of activity in young  animals but were highly effective in adults; delta opiate antagonists failed to  increase LH either in young or adult animals. In contrast to these data, we  observed that mu and kappa agonists were equipotent in depressing serum LH levels  in both young and adult animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1988-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","14-20","","1","246","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2839658","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Testosterone/blood; *Aging; Luteinizing Hormone/*blood; Naloxone/pharmacology; Narcotics/*pharmacology; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, kappa; Receptors, Opioid/*metabolism; Receptors, Opioid, mu; Receptors, Opioid, delta; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted subcutaneously  with a pellet containing 10 mg of naltrexone for 7 days. Placebo pellet implanted  rats served as controls. The pellets were removed on day 8, and the analgesic and  hyperthermic effects were determined in the rat 24 hr later. Morphine produced a  dose-dependent analgesic and hyperthermic responses in rats implanted with  placebo pellets. Enhanced analgesic and hyperthermic responses to morphine were  produced in rats implanted with naltrexone pellets. 3. The binding constants  (Bmax and Kd values) of [3H]DAMGO in regions of the brain (amygdala,  hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, pons + medulla and cortex), and  spinal cord of rats with naltrexone pellet left intact or removed were  determined. The Bmax values of [3H]DAMGO were increased in all brain regions and  spinal cord of rats in which the naltrexone pellets were left in place or removed  prior to sacrificing. However, the Kd values of [3H]DAMGO were unaffected by  naltrexone treatment. 4. It is concluded that enhanced analgesic and hyperthermic  response to morphine is produced in rats implanted with naltrexone pellets and  such alterations in the pharmacological responses are due to up-regulation of  mu-opiate receptors in all the brain regions and spinal cord.

Preparation, hydrolysis, stability, pharmacokinetics].","Acta pharmaceutica Hungarica","","0001-6659","","","Heroin is prepared by treating morphine with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. It is a simple reaction and the yields are generally quantitative. Nowadays the  whole process is illegal. Morphine is the major alkaloid present in the opium  poppy. Opium is manufactured illicitly then morphine is extracted from it in  clandestine laboratories. Numerous studies were carried out on heroin to  investigate its rate of hydrolysis. It has been shown that heroin is rapidly  deacylated in aqueous solution at alkaline or acidic pH to form 6-acethylmorphine  and finally, to morphine. Heroin also rapidly decomposes in biological medium  yielding first 6-acetylmorphine and then morphine. Hydrolysis can be performed in  blood and in tissue homogenates. Heroin can be administered by several routes.  Smoking and intravenous administration are preferred, but intranasal,  intramuscular and subcutaneous administration are also common. Recently, there  has been a shift in heroin use patterns from injection to sniffing and smoking.  Sharing of the injection equipment can result in several severe infectious  diseases, such as AIDS, hepatitis B and C. Soon after administration, heroin  metabolizes to 6-acetylmorphine and morphine. Most of the pharmacological  activities of heroin are due to these active metabolites. Therefore, knowledge of  distribution of 6-acetylmorphine and morphine is essential to understand  pharmacological properties of heroin. Heroin, which is relatively nonpolar  compound compared with morphine, has high lipid solubility facilitating rapid  absorption from the bloodstream and passage through the blood-brain barrier. When  heroin is administered by intravenously the drug takes 10 s to reach the brain  i.e. pharmacological effects appear quickly.","2001-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","373-383","","3","71","","Acta Pharm Hung","","","","","","","","hun","","","","","","","Place: Hungary PMID: 11961908","","","","Humans; Drug Stability; Heroin/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Twelve patients  were randomly assigned to receive either epidural analgesia or patient-controlled  analgesia with intravenous morphine for perioperative pain control. Protein and  glucose kinetics were measured before surgery and on the second postoperative day  using L-[1-C]leucine and [6,6H2]glucose infusion during a fasted and a fed (amino  acid infusion) state. RESULTS: Preoperative parameters for glucose and protein  kinetics were comparable in the fasted state for both groups. Postoperative amino  acid infusion increased glucose concentration slightly (P = 0.124) and suppressed  the endogenous rate of appearance of glucose (P < 0.0001) and glucose clearance  (P < 0.0001) regardless of analgesia technique. The rate of appearance of leucine  (P = 0.002), leucine oxidation (P < 0.0001), and protein synthesis (P = 0.026)  increased, whereas net protein breakdown was decreased (P = 0.002), leading to a  positive protein balance (P < 0.0001) in both groups. The increase in protein  balance was greater in the epidural group compared with the patient-controlled  analgesia group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Diabetic patients receiving an amino  acid infusion after surgery achieved a positive protein balance without  hyperglycemia. This anabolic effect was greater in patients receiving epidural  analgesia compared with patient-controlled analgesia with intravenous morphine.","2008-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1093-1099","","6","108","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18497611","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Postoperative Period; Carbon Isotopes; Blood Glucose/drug effects/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*metabolism; Elective Surgical Procedures; Proteins/metabolism; Postoperative Complications/prevention & control; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage; Morphine/administration & dosage; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled/methods; Analgesia, Epidural/*methods; Colon/*surgery; Amino Acids/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology; Keto Acids/blood; Leucine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For eight TPs, the  chemical structures were unambiguously identified by a multistep approach using  results from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) and 1D and 2D nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. For an additional 10 TPs, tentative  structures were proposed. Most of the TPs identified exhibited only slightly  modified molecular structures featuring double bond shifts, introduction of  hydroxy groups, or amine demethylation. The transformation pathway of codeine in  contact with activated sludge is characterized by a combination of biologically  and chemically mediated reactions. Biological oxidation of codeine leads to the  formation of the α,β-unsaturated ketone codeinone, which is the precursor for  further abiotic and biotic transformation due to its high chemical reactivity. An  analytical method based on solid-phase extraction and LC tandem MS detection was  developed to confirm the formation of several TPs in wastewater treatment plants  (WWTPs). The mass balances were comparable to those obtained from batch  experiments. An HR-MS screening approach of TPs from dihydrocodeine and morphine  revealed that the knowledge from the codeine transformation pathway can be  extrapolated to the distinct transformation pathways of these structurally  related opium alkaloids. In total, 17 TPs were proposed for morphine and 2 TPs  for dihydrocodeine.","2011-04-15","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:47:34","","3374-3385","","8","45","","Environ Sci Technol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Wick2011a PMID: 21428281 place: United States","","","","Biotransformation; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Bacteria/metabolism; Water Microbiology; Waste Disposal, Fluid/*methods; Analgesics, Opioid/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism; Codeine/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to investigate  whether CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) and CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EM)  would respond differently during testing for opiate drugs of abuse in urine after  intake of these drugs. Five PM and five EM of dextromethorphan were administered  single oral doses of codeine (25 mg) and ethylmorphine (25 mg), and the urinary  excretion of parent compounds and selected metabolites was observed for 72 hours.  Analysis was performed with GC-MS after hydrolysis of the glucuronide conjugates.  Selected urine samples were screened for the presence of opiates by the Abbott  ADx immunoassay method. The results from one PM and one EM were excluded because  of technical analytical problems. EM excreted significantly more morphine than PM  after intake of both codeine (6.5% vs. 1.1% of the dose; p < 0.05) and  ethylmorphine (11.0% vs. 3.0% of the dose; p < 0.05). Screening results were  positive significantly longer for EM than for PM after codeine intake (mean, 33  hours vs. 17 hours; p < 0.05), and the same trend, albeit nonsignificantly, was  noted for ethylmorphine (mean, 33 hours vs. 24 hours). Regardless of CYP2D6  phenotype, significantly more morphine was formed after intake of ethylmorphine  than after intake of codeine (7.0% vs. 3.8% of the dose; p < 0.05). There were  high correlations between dextromethorphan metabolic ratios and the ratios of  codeine to morphine, ethylmorphine to morphine, norcodeine to normorphine, and  norethylmorphine to normorphine (r = 0.80 to 0.92; p = 0.030 to 0.001). Although  this study should be interpreted with caution because of the few subjects  included and the single-dose design, it demonstrates that the CYP2D6 phenotype  clearly affects the results when testing for opiates in urine after intake of  codeine and ethylmorphine.","1997-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","643-649","","6","19","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9421105","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Phenotype; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/metabolism/*urine; Codeine/metabolism/*urine; Ethylmorphine/metabolism/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The enzyme responsible for this reaction for this group of drugs is cytochrome P-450IID6.  Humans can be classified either as extensive metabolisers or, if lacking this  enzyme, poor metabolisers. The incidence of poor metabolisers in caucasian  subjects is 7-10%. The hepatic O-demethylation of codeine to morphine,  quantitatively a minor metabolic process, represents this type of genetic  polymorphism and has been studied in human pharmacokinetic studies, human urinary  recovery studies, and in human and rat liver microsome experiments. Based on the  current understanding that the analgesic effect of codeine is mediated primarily  through morphine, one might anticipate that poor metabolisers would not obtain  pain relief from codeine. The clinical significance of this polymorphism to the  antidiarrhoeal and antitussive properties of codeine is not known. Others opioids  (dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and thebaine) are structurally similar  to codeine and their metabolism (O-demethylation at the 3 position) might also be  under genetic control.

Using a mouse  hot-plate test, dose-response relationships were first determined for all  compounds individually and then for opioids co-administered with fixed doses of  ketamine or dextromethorphan. All compounds were administered intraperitoneally  ED(50) values were calculated from the proportion of animals failing to exhibit  any response within a fixed cut-off criterion of 30 s. To varying degrees, all  compounds produced increases in response latencies over time. Dextromethorphan  produced lower ED(50) values for morphine, fentanyl and sufentanil but exerted no  effect on the potency of SNC80 or U50,488H. Similarly, ketamine potentiated the  antinociceptive potency of morphine, fentanyl and sufentanil but not SNC80 or  U50,488H. In summary, these results support the use of mu-opioid agonists in  combination with NMDA antagonists, but suggest that there may be no advantage in  combining dextromethorphan or ketamine with delta- or kappa-opioids in the  management of acute pain.","2002-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","73-86","","1","74","","Pharmacol Biochem Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12376154","","","","Male; Animals; Drug Synergism; Mice; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Reaction Time/drug effects; Dextromethorphan/*pharmacology; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors; Ketamine/*pharmacology; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology; Piperazines/pharmacology; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Morphine/pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, kappa/*agonists; Receptors, Opioid, mu/*agonists; Fentanyl/pharmacology; 3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide, (trans)-Isomer/pharmacology; Pain/*drug therapy/psychology; Sufentanil/pharmacology; Benzamides/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, delta/*agonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, pain is often inadequately managed in elderly people, which undermines quality of life. Pain has been  associated with depression, sleep disturbances, impaired ambulation, and  increased healthcare use and costs. Effective treatment of pain improves the  overall quality of life. However, pain management is complicated by the presence  of multiple co-morbidities in elderly people, which increases the likelihood of  polypharmacy, and therefore increases the chance of potential drug-drug  interactions. Polypharmacy is also associated with poor adherence to therapy.  Age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes reduce the therapeutic  index of drugs. Therefore, elderly people are more likely to suffer from adverse  events and increased sensitivity to the analgesic properties of opioids. OROS  hydromorphone (Jurnista) is a once-daily, extended-release formulation that uses  the OROS push-pull technology to provide controlled release of the semi-synthetic  opioid hydromorphone. Compared with conventional immediate-release hydromorphone,  OROS hydromorphone provides more consistent delivery of hydromorphone with lower  peak concentrations and less variability in plasma concentrations over time. The  bioavailability of hydromorphone from OROS hydromorphone is minimally affected by  food or alcohol (ethanol). Hydromorphone is mainly metabolized in the liver and  is excreted in the urine. Unlike morphine, hydromorphone does not have an active  6-glucuronide metabolite. This metabolite of morphine can accumulate in the  presence of renal failure; therefore, the lack of an active 6-glucuronide  metabolite makes hydromorphone a useful alternative to morphine in elderly  patients with renal failure. However, hydromorphone is similar to morphine in  that it is metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which may be  neuroexcitatory. Because of its low plasma protein binding and low probability of  interfering with the metabolism of other drugs, hydromorphone may be especially  suitable for patients taking multiple medications. OROS hydromorphone is an  effective analgesic that is well tolerated and provides more stable plasma  concentrations than immediate-release forms of hydromorphone. Its once-daily  administration offers an advantage over immediate-release forms and longer-acting  formulations that require twice-daily administration. This means OROS  hydromorphone will be more convenient for elderly patients and may improve  adherence, resulting in improved pain relief and quality of life.","2010-04-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","327-335","","4","27","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 20361803","","","","Humans; Aged; Pain/*drug therapy; Delayed-Action Preparations; Hydromorphone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated  the effects of opioids after intraperitoneal administration of antisense  oligodeoxynucleotides to mu- and/or delta-opioid receptor mRNA. Inflammation was  induced in mice by intragastric administration of croton oil; gastrointestinal  transit was assessed with charcoal and permeability with  [51Cr]etylenediaminetetraacetate ([51Cr]EDTA). Baseline values were unaltered  after antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. In controls, antisense  oligodeoxynucleotides to mu-opioid receptor mRNA decreased the antitransit  effects of morphine (27%) and [N-MePhe3D-Pro4]morphiceptin (PL017) (26%), and the  reduction was significantly greater during inflammation (50% and 47%). A similar  effect was observed on permeability (control: 41-21% decrease; inflamed: 66-45%).  In both assays, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to delta-opioid receptor mRNA  also reduced the effects of [D-Pen2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE) in a higher percentage  during inflammation (43-32% controls, 60-49% inflamed). We show that antisense  oligodeoxynucleotides to mu- and/or delta-opioid receptor mRNA are efficiently  blocking the intestinal effects of opioids during inflammation, suggesting that  an increased transcription of these receptors in the gut mediates the enhanced  effects of opioids during inflammation.","2001-09-28","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","127-136","","1","428","","Eur J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 11779029","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis; Irritants; Gastrointestinal Transit/drug effects; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Morphine/pharmacology; Narcotics/pharmacology; Endorphins/pharmacology; Enkephalin, D-Penicillamine (2,5)-/pharmacology; Croton Oil; Enteritis/chemically induced/*physiopathology; Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, delta/agonists/biosynthesis/*genetics; Receptors, Opioid, mu/agonists/biosynthesis/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new generic oxycodone hydrochloride (HCl) extended  release (ER) tablet is currently being developed by Ranbaxy Pharmaceutical Inc.,  New Brunswick, NJ, USA. OBJECTIVE: To assess relative bioavailability of a new  generic (test) formulation of oxycodone hydrochloride (HCl) extended release (ER)  tablets with that of marketed reference products, OxyContin®, in Canada and USA,  in healthy adult subjects under fasting and fed conditions. METHODS: Five studies  were conducted in all, three of which were designed to comply with the regulatory  criteria for marketing a new generic formulation of OxyContin® in Canada and the  remaining two to comply with regulatory criteria for marketing a new generic  formulation of OxyContin® in the USA. Each study was a balanced, randomized  two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover design. A single oral dose of  test or reference product was given in Period 1, followed by a 7-day washout  period, after which subjects received the alternative product in Period 2. In  order to block the pharmacological effects of oxycodone, subjects were  administered naltrexone HCl (1 × 50 mg tablet) 12 hours prior to oxycodone HCl  administration, concurrent with oxycodone HCl administration, and 12 hours after  oxycodone HCl administration. Throughout the confinement portion of the study,  adverse events were closely monitored. Serial blood samples were collected,  following which oxycodone in plasma was estimated using a validated analytical  procedure. RESULTS: Oxycodone was well tolerated by subjects in both periods of  each study under both fed and fasted conditions. No serious adverse events were  observed. The ratios of geometric means for AUC0-t and Cmax and the affiliated  90% confidence intervals for AUC were within acceptance range recommended by  Health Canada. These criteria were met for both the raw data as well as data  corrected for measured drug content (potency). The ratios of geometric means and  the 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax were within acceptance  range recommended by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that the test formulation of oxycodone HCl ER  tablets is bioequivalent to marketed OxyContin® reference formulations in Canada  and USA, when administered both under fasted and fed conditions. Additionally,  oxycodone HCl ER tablets were well tolerated as a single oral dose when  administered to healthy adult subjects under fasted and fed conditions.","2013-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","895-907","","11","51","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 23673291","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Cross-Over Studies; Young Adult; Therapeutic Equivalency; United States; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Delayed-Action Preparations; Tablets; Canada; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics; Oxycodone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Opioid analgesics are an important component of pharmacotherapy for chronic pain  and have proven efficacy in the management of cancer and noncancer chronic pain.  The newest addition to oral opioid pharmacotherapy is oral oxymorphone, a  semisynthetic opioid agonist that is now available in oral immediate-release (IR)  and extended-release (ER) formulations. This review discusses the pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacotherapeutics, and clinical use of  oral oxymorphone IR and ER formulations for the management of moderate to severe  pain for different types of patients in a variety of settings. Two published  studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of oxymorphone IR in patients with  moderate to severe postoperative pain and demonstrated that it provides rapid and  effective analgesia and is generally well tolerated. Six published randomized  controlled trials and three published open-label studies evaluated the efficacy  and safety of oxymorphone ER for chronic cancer or noncancer pain. These trials  found analgesic efficacy and tolerability comparable to that provided by morphine  controlled release (CR) or oxycodone CR; treatment effects with oxymorphone ER  were durable for treatment periods of 12 weeks at the same dose or up to 1 year  with little dose escalation. Titrated doses of oxymorphone ER were effective and  generally well tolerated in both opioid-experienced and opioid-naïve patients.  Aspects of oxymorphone metabolism and limited protein binding may simplify  treatment in certain populations.","2008-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","131-144","","3","4","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18717508","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Follow-Up Studies; Drug Interactions; Food-Drug Interactions; Pain/*drug therapy; Delayed-Action Preparations; Chronic Disease; Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use; Oxymorphone/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In chronic pain management requiring  long-term therapy, pharmaceutical technologies that ensure the controlled release  of analgesic medications are imperative. In addition, once-daily formulations  ensure better patient compliance to prescribed therapies. Hydromorphone was the  first opioid to be formulated as a once-daily preparation using OROS® technology.  The purpose of this review is to discuss the application of OROS® technology in  the field of chronic pain management and to examine clinical trial results for  OROS® Hydromorphone. OROS® hydromorphone ensures the constant delivery of  hydromorphone over a 24-hour period, and its pharmacokinetic profile is only  minimally affected by food and alcohol. Dose-conversion studies have shown that  patients with chronic pain can be easily switched from previous opioid therapies  to OROS® hydromorphone without a loss of pain control. These studies support the  clinical utility of the 5:1 ratio used for the conversion of oral morphine to  oral OROS® hydromorphone. Furthermore, once-daily OROS® hydromorphone has been  shown to be effective in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain, and it  provides similar pain relief to SR morphine and ER oxycodone. In chronic pain  management, OROS® products can result in more stable drug concentrations, reduced  dosing frequency and an improved safety profile.","2010-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1072-1084","","12","76","","Minerva Anestesiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 21102402","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Pain/*drug therapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Delayed-Action Preparations; *Drug Delivery Systems; Chronic Disease; Osmotic Pressure; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hydromorphone/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  pharmacokinetics of methadone differ from those of morphine in that methadone has  a higher bioavailability, a much longer half-life, and is hepatically metabolized  by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of methadone are variable and an  understanding of the factors that impact the onset, magnitude, and duration of  analgesia is required to optimize therapy. Drug interactions are common and  patients receiving methadone should be monitored closely for toxicity or  therapeutic failure. Special populations in whom a change from the usual dosage  regimen may be necessary include pediatric patients, patients with renal failure,  the elderly, and pregnant women. To achieve an optimal dosage regimen, the  clinician must have an understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  of methadone in addition to the relationship between these variables and their  patients' demographic and pathophysiologic characteristics. AMEDLINE search was  performed to identify literature published between 1966 and May 2005 relevant to  the pharmacokinetics of methadone.

The authors report a case of  suspected tolerance to the analgesic effect of opioid, in which an increasing  dose of fentanyl failed to relieve the patient's cancer pain symptoms, but opioid  switching to oxycodone injections enabled a dose reduction to below the  equivalent dose conversion ratio. The patient was a 60-year-old man diagnosed  with pancreatic body carcinoma with multiple metastases. The base dose consisted  of 12 mg/day of transdermal fentanyl patches (equivalent to 3.6 mg/day, 150 μg/h  fentanyl injection), and rescue therapy consisted of 10 mg immediate-release  oxycodone powders. Despite the total daily dose of fentanyl reaching 5.6 mg  (equivalent to 560 mg oral morphine), the analgesic effect was inadequate; thus,  an urgent adjustment was necessary. Due to the moderate dose of fentanyl, the  switch to oxycodone injection was done incrementally at a daily dose equivalent  to 25% of the fentanyl injection. The total dose of oxycodone was replaced  approximately 53.5% of the dose of fentanyl prior to opioid switching.","2015-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 06:03:35","","161-165","","2","29","","J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Sutou2015a PMID: 26095488 place: England","","","","Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Therapeutic Equivalency; Treatment Failure; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Pain Management/*methods; oxycodone; fentanyl; Oxycodone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; cancer pain; Fentanyl/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Pancreatic Neoplasms/*complications; Drug Substitution/methods; opioid switching; Pain/*etiology; tolerance to the analgesic effect of opioid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, anticancer drugs and painkillers are often prescribed together. This study aims  to determine the interaction between anlotinib and oxycodone and reveal the  underlying mechanism. METHODS: UPLC-MS/MS, an efficient and sensitive method, was  used for the simultaneous determination of oxycodone and oxycodone metabolites.  Sprague-Dawley rats were given oxycodone with or without anlotinib. Then,  UPLC-MS/MS was used to determine the blood concentration of oxycodone. To study  the interaction mechanism, rat and human liver microsomes (HLMs) were used for  determining enzyme kinetics. RESULTS: Long-term administration of oxycodone  combined with anlotinib resulted in significantly increased pharmacokinetic  parameters AUC((0-t)), AUC((0-∞)), and C(max) for oxycodone, indicating that  anlotinib inhibited oxycodone. In vitro kinetic measurements indicated that  anlotinib inhibited the metabolism of oxycodone through a mixed mechanism.  Further studies indicated that in HLMs, anlotinib strongly inhibited the  metabolism of oxycodone. CONCLUSION: This study showed that anlotinib inhibited  the metabolism of oxycodone both in vitro and in vivo. It is recommended that the  dose of oxycodone should be reconsidered when oxycodone is combined with  anlotinib in clinical practice.","2022-09-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","110044","","","364","","Chem Biol Interact","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

The fentanyl derivatives have reduced or  eliminated many of the disadvantages of opioid anesthetics, such as incomplete  amnesia and undesirable hemodynamic responses to surgery. Fentanyl is 50-100  times as potent as morphine and was the first of the three to be marketed.  Sufentanil is even more potent than fentanyl. Alfentanil has the fastest onset of  action, followed by sufentanil and then fentanyl. Alfentanil also has the  shortest duration of action of the group. Most studies of these agents have been  done to assess their role as anesthetics in cardiac surgery. All three provide  cardiovascular stability when administered before noxious surgical stimuli,  except when given as a single bolus during the induction of anesthesia. All seem  to produce adequate anesthesia, particularly when used in combination with  nitrous oxide. Because of its short duration of action, alfentanil is preferred  for brief procedures or when rapid changes in the level of consciousness are  desired. All three agents have also been used for analgesia; epidural  administration provides adequate relief of pain. Fentanyl has been formulated as  a transdermal patch that seems to provide the same degree of analgesia as a  continuous i.v. infusion.

Hence it is surprising--at least according to the advice of German  textbooks--that activated charcoal is only recommended for administration after  time-consuming treatments like induced emesis and gastric lavage. Particularly  with infants at home, a ready-for-use suspension of activated charcoal would  allow the early management of acute poisoning. In such cases, inactivation of the  poison by adsorption could be particularly helpful, since the period after  ingestion is usually short. The charcoal-sorbitol-suspension (30 g activated  charcoal in 150 ml of 70% sorbitol) is a creamy preparation which is easy to  drink, because density and viscosity prevent sedimentation. The prescription-free  drugs can be dispensed by each pharmacist. The present study was undertaken to  investigate the influence of sorbitol on the adsorption capacity of activated  charcoal. To this end, adsorption isotherms were established in vitro and  compared with results in volunteers to whom NAPAP, diphenhydramine or codeine was  administered separately. These drugs are gaining increasing importance in  medicinal toxicology since they are constituents of various analgesics and cold  remedies. To determine absorption, the cumulative urinary excretion was estimated  of the parent drugs and their main metabolites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1991-11-26","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","887-894","","19","69","","Klin Wochenschr","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 1812318","","","","Humans; Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Intestinal Absorption/*drug effects/physiology; Acetaminophen/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning; Charcoal/*administration & dosage; Codeine/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning; Diphenhydramine/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning; Drug Overdose/*blood/*therapy; Sorbitol/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

INTERVENTIONS: Single intact oral tablets  that were placebo or contained OM-ER (15 and 30 mg) or OC-CR (30 and 60 mg).  Doses were representative of mid-range doses for chronic pain and were calculated  using an established opioid conversion table. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual  Analog Scales, Subjective Drug Value (SDV), and Addiction Research Center  Inventory (ARCI) measured positive, negative, and balance effects and  pupillometry. Equianalgesic comparisons were between OM-ER 15 mg versus OC-CR 30  mg (low doses) and OM-ER 30 mg versus OC-CR 60 mg (high doses). RESULTS:  Thirty-five subjects received all five treatments. Positive subjective effects  were lower for OM-ER 15 mg versus OC-CR 30 mg and for OM-ER 30 mg versus OC-CR 60  mg in ARCI Morphine Benzedrine Group (< or = 0.01 for both), Good Effects (p <  0.001 for both), Rush (p < 0.001 for both), and High VAS (p < 0.001 for both).  Nausea was higher with OC-CR (p < or = 0.02), and Bad Effects were higher for  OC-CR 60 mg versus OM-ER 30 mg (p < 0.001). Balance effects were lower for OM-ER  versus OC-CR (Drug Liking, p < 0.001; Overall Drug Liking, p < or = 0.006; SDV, p  < or = 0.008), except for Take Drug Again (p < 0.001 for OC-CR 30 mg versus OM-ER  15 mg; p = 0.18 for high-dose group). Euphoric mood, nausea, somnolence,  vomiting, and dizziness were more common with OC-CR than OM-ER. LIMITATIONS:  Single-dose design; use of healthy, recreational opioid users. CONCLUSIONS: At  equianalgesic doses, single oral intact OM-ER produced lower positive, negative,  and balance subjective effects than OC-CR, indicating that analgesic potency may  not necessarily be reflected in subjective/objective effects.","2011-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","179-192","","3","7","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21823549","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Cross-Over Studies; Young Adult; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Delayed-Action Preparations; Endpoint Determination; Drug Users; Euphoria/drug effects; Pupil/drug effects; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Opioid-Related Disorders/*psychology; Oxycodone/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Oxymorphone/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pharmacokinetics of intravenous oxycodone in  the obese population has not been studied. This study aims to characterize the  pharmacokinetic profile of oxycodone after intravenous administration and to  simulate an appropriate dosage for analgesic efficacy in obese patients. METHODS:  We recruited 33 (age range from 21 to 72 years) adult patients with a body mass  index of 30 kg/m(2) and above, who were scheduled for non-cardiac surgeries.  Intravenous oxycodone was administered after induction of general anesthesia and  blood samples were collected up to 24 h after oxycodone administration. Plasma  concentrations of oxycodone were assayed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry and 253 concentration-time points were used for pharmacokinetic  analysis using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: Intravenous oxycodone  pharmacokinetics were well described by a two-compartment open model. The  estimated total clearance and central volume of distribution of oxycodone are  28.5 l/h per 70 kg and 56.4 l per 70 kg, respectively. Total body weight was  identified as a significant covariate of the clearance and central volume of  distribution. Dosing simulations based on the final model demonstrate that a  starting dose of 0.10 mg/kg of intravenous oxycodone is adequate to achieve a  target plasma concentration and repeated doses of 0.02 mg/kg may be administered  at 1.5-h intervals to maintain a plasma concentration within an effective  analgesic range. CONCLUSIONS: A population pharmacokinetic model using total body  weight as a covariate supports the administration of 0.10 mg/kg of intravenous  oxycodone as a starting dose and repeated doses of 0.02 mg/kg at 1.5-h intervals  to maintain targeted plasma concentrations for analgesia in the obese adult  population.","2023-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","11-21","","1","48","","Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Pharmacological profile and clinical data in chronic pain management.","Minerva anestesiologica","","0375-9393","","","Opioids are widely used as effective analgesic therapy for cancer pain. Despite years of controversy, their use has been also accepted in chronic non-cancer  pain. Oxycodone alone and in combination has been used for over 80 years in the  treatment of a variety of pain syndromes. As single agent, the controlled release  (CR) oxycodone's market in the USA grew from 10% in 1996 to 53% in 2000 and it  has become a leading opioid in the United States. Recent data showed that the  fixed-combination oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg) is the most often  prescribed opioid across all the different chronic pain diagnoses. Compared with  morphine, oxycodone has a higher oral bioavailability and is about twice as  potent. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data support oxycodone as a  pharmacologically active opiod that does not require conversion to oxymoprhone  for pharmacological activity. Seven studies addressed the safety and efficacy of  oxycodone for the treatment of non-cancer pain (low back pain, osteoarthritis  pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy). Both immediate release (IR) and CR  oxycodone are equally effective and safe. Along these trials, mean daily dosage  of oxycodone was approximately 40 mg, with a low incidence of intolerable typical  opiate side effects. In cancer pain, oxycodone can be considered a valid  alternative to oral morphine to be used for opioid rotation. No difference in  analgesic efficacy between CR oxycodone and CR morphine was found.  Controlled-release preparations, with a long duration of action, are attractive  because they offer the advantage of longer dosing intervals and sustained  analgesic effect.","2005-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","451-460","","7-8","71","","Minerva Anestesiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 16012419","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Delayed-Action Preparations; Chronic Disease; Neoplasms/complications; Pain/*drug therapy/etiology; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Oxycodone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the  volatilisation set-up was combined with an Andersen sampler to determine the  sizes of aerosol particles. Only small differences in recovery of  diacetylmorphine and caffeine were found between temperatures and between powder  mixtures: 46-62% of diacetylmorphine from the sample was recovered in vapour and  65-83% of caffeine. The only degradation product detected in vapour was  6-acetylmorphine (4.1-7.1%). In the temperature range studied, temperature mainly  influenced the volatilisation rate. Mass median aerodynamic diameters of aerosols  from diacetylmorphine-containing samples ranged from 1.8-4.1 microm; 45-60% of  each sample was recovered as aerosol particles <5 microm. Volatilising  pharmaceutical smokable heroin resulted in sufficient amounts of diacetylmorphine  in vapour and in particles suitable for effective deposition in the lungs.","2006-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","438-445","","5","61","","Pharmazie","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 16724542","","","","Biological Availability; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Temperature; Aerosols; Particle Size; Volatilization; Models, Chemical; Substance-Related Disorders; Caffeine/chemistry; Central Nervous System Stimulants/chemistry; Heroin/*chemistry; Narcotics/*chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are several challenges with modelling  oxycodone abuse. First, prescription opioids including oxycodone are orally  self-administered and have different pharmacokinetics and dynamics than morphine  or fentanyl, which have been more commonly used in rodent research. This oral  route of administration determines the pharmacokinetic profile, which then  influences the establishment of drug-reinforcement associations in animals.  Moreover, the pattern of intake and the environment in which addictive drugs are  self-administered are critical determinants of the levels of drug intake, of  behavioural sensitization and of propensity to relapse behaviour. These are all  important considerations when modelling prescription opioid use, which is  characterized by continuous drug access in familiar environments. Thus, to model  features of prescription opioid use and the transition to abuse, we designed an  oral, homecage-based oxycodone self-administration paradigm. Mice voluntarily  self-administer oxycodone in this paradigm without any taste modification such as  sweeteners, and the majority exhibit preference for oxycodone, escalation of  intake, physical signs of dependence and reinstatement of seeking after  withdrawal. In addition, a subset of animals demonstrate drug taking that is  resistant to aversive consequences. This model is therefore translationally  relevant and useful for studying the neurobiological substrates of prescription  opioid abuse.","2023-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","e13253","","1","28","","Addict Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Society for the Study of Addiction.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36577735","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Mice; Fentanyl; Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use; oxycodone; *Oxycodone; Reinforcement, Psychology; *Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy; opioid addiction; oral self-administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GluRepsilon1 mutant mice showed an attenuation of acute PCP- and MAP-induced  hyperlocomotion. The development of sensitization by repeated treatment with PCP  and MAP at a low, but not high, dose was also suppressed. The development of  MOR-induced analgesic tolerance and naloxone-precipitated MOR withdrawal symptoms  were attenuated in GluRepsilon1 mutant mice. In the place conditioning test,  PCP-induced place aversion in naive mice and place preference in PCP-pretreated  mice, as well as MOR-induced place preference, were diminished whereas  MAP-induced place preference was not affected in GluRepsilon1 mutant mice.

We propose the programming of educational  PK or PK/PD computer simulations as an alternative to the use of pre-built  simulation software. This approach has the advantage of adaptability to  non-standard or complicated PK or PK/PD models. Simplicity of the programming  procedure was achieved by selecting the LabVIEW programming environment. An  intuitive user interface to visualize the time courses of drug concentrations or  effects can be obtained with pre-built elements. The environment uses a wiring  analogy that resembles electrical circuit diagrams rather than abstract  programming code. The goal of high interactivity of the simulation was attained  by allowing the program to run in continuously repeating loops. This makes the  program behave flexibly to the user input. The programming is described with the  aid of a 2-compartment PK simulation. Examples of more sophisticated simulation  programs are also given where the PK/PD simulation shows drug input,  concentrations in plasma, and at effect site and the effects themselves as a  function of time. A multi-compartmental model of morphine, including metabolite  kinetics and effects is also included. The programs are available for download  from the World Wide Web at http:// www. klinik.uni-frankfurt.de/zpharm/klin/  PKPDsimulation/content.html. For pharmacokineticists who only program  occasionally, there is the possibility of building the computer simulation,  together with the flexible interactive simulation algorithm for clinical  pharmacological teaching in the field of PK/PD models.","2004-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","15-22","","1","42","","Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 14756382","","","","Algorithms; Software; *Pharmacokinetics; *Models, Biological; Computers; *Computer Simulation; *Programming Languages; Models, Educational","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current study, we hypothesized that  administration of the combination of codeine and acetaminophen would result in a  significant thermal antinociceptive effect compared with administration of either  alone. Six horses were administered oral doses of codeine (1.2 mg/kg),  acetaminophen (20 mg/kg), and codeine plus acetaminophen (1.2 mg/kg codeine and  6-6.4 mg/kg acetaminophen) in a three-way balanced crossover design.

Pharmacodynamic outcomes, including effect on thermal thresholds, were  assessed. Codeine C(max) and AUC were significantly different between the codeine  and combination group. There was considerable inter-individual variation in the  pharmacokinetic parameters for codeine, acetaminophen, and their metabolites in  horses.

Drugs  that are eliminated by Phase I oxidation reactions are sensitive to changes in  hepatic blood flow, while drugs eliminated by Phase II glucuronidation are more  affected by diseased hepatocytes. Additionally, alterations in renal function  decrease elimination of both parent drugs and metabolites, resulting in toxicity  for selected opioids such as meperidine and morphine. Caution is suggested in  drawing general conclusions from pharmacokinetic patterns of opioid elimination  discussed in this review. Practitioners should be aware that drugs with short  duration of action may have long half-lives and accumulate in end-stage liver and  renal disease. While pharmacokinetic differences have been described in various  populations, the clinical effects and adverse outcomes are greatly influenced by  numerous independent physiologic alterations seen in critical care patients.  Patients with severe alterations in liver and renal function should be  administered pain medications judiciously because these patients are predisposed  to metabolic disarrays. These patients should not be denied pain care, but they  may benefit from smaller, less frequently administered doses, rather than  continuous infusion of opioid drugs. Titration of doses to clinical effects with  careful patient assessment for adverse effects is crucial for achieving desired  therapeutic outcomes with analgesic agents in the ICU.","1999-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:53:03","","55-75","","1","15","","Crit Care Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Volles PMID: 9929786 place: United States","","","","Humans; Half-Life; Tissue Distribution; Liver/metabolism; Kidney/metabolism; Intensive Care Units; Absorption; Critical Care/*methods; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Pain/metabolism/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

D.","Discriminative stimulus effects of intravenous heroin and its metabolites in rhesus monkeys: opioid and dopaminergic mechanisms.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","","0022-3565","","","Heroin has characteristic subjective effects that contribute importantly to its widespread abuse. Drug discrimination procedures in animals have proven to be  useful models for investigating pharmacological mechanisms underlying the  subjective effects of drugs in humans. However, surprisingly little information  exists concerning the mechanisms underlying the discriminative stimulus (DS)  effects of heroin. This study characterized the DS effects of heroin in rhesus  monkeys trained to discriminate i.v. heroin from saline. In drug substitution  experiments, heroin, its metabolites 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine,  morphine-6-glucuronide, and morphine-3-glucuronide, and the mu-agonists fentanyl  and methadone engendered dose-dependent increases in heroin-lever responding,  reaching average maximums of >80% (full substitution) at doses that did not  appreciably suppress response rate. In contrast, the delta-agonist SNC 80, the  kappa-agonist spiradoline, and the dopamine uptake blockers/releasers cocaine,  methamphetamine, and GBR 12909 did not engender heroin-like DS effects regardless  of dose. In antagonism studies, in vivo apparent pA2 and pK(B) values for  naltrexone combined with heroin, morphine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine (8.0-8.7)  were comparable with those reported previously for naltrexone antagonism of  prototypical mu-agonists. The results show that the DS effects of heroin are  pharmacologically specific and mediated primarily at mu-opioid receptors.  Moreover, the acetylated and glucuronated metabolites of heroin appear to play  significant roles in these effects. Despite previous speculation that  morphine-3-glucuronide lacks significant opioid activity, it substituted fully  for heroin in our study, suggesting that it can exhibit prominent mu-agonist  effects in vivo.","2001-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","760-767","","2","299","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11602692","","","","Male; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Intravenous; Macaca mulatta; Dopamine/metabolism; Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology; Receptors, Dopamine/*drug effects; Naltrexone/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid/*drug effects; Discrimination, Psychological/*drug effects; Dopamine Agonists/pharmacology; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology; Generalization, Psychological; Heroin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Narcotics/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Do they contribute to drug abuse and dependence?","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199631050-00004","","The elderly frequently use psychoactive drugs including alcohol (ethanol), benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics, which have a propensity to cause abuse and  dependence. Theoretically, the changes in pharmacokinetics of these agents in the  elderly may modify their abuse and dependence potential. In the elderly, blood  alcohol concentrations following an oral dose are higher, alcohol withdrawal  syndrome follows a more severe and protracted clinical course and requires  treatment with higher doses of chlordiazepoxide than needed for younger adults.  However, there is no direct evidence that supports an increased direct abuse and  dependence potential of alcohol because of its altered kinetics in the elderly.  In the case of oxidatively metabolised benzodiazepine, both age-related  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic changes may increase their clinical effects  in the elderly. The hypothesis that benzodiazepines have an increased abuse and  dependence potential in the elderly has not been tested. Many of the  benzodiazepines (e.g. alprazolam, triazolam and midazolam) are metabolised by the  cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A subfamily. The pharmacokinetics of these agents may be  modified by inhibition of CYP3A due to concurrently administered medications such  as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Unfortunately, data on the direct  measures of abuse and dependence potential of benzodiazepines are not available  in the elderly. Thus, a conclusive statement on the contribution of age-related  pharmacokinetic changes to benzodiazepine abuse and dependence cannot be made at  the present time. The clinical effects of codeine do not appear to change with  age. Codeine is O-demethylated to its active metabolite morphine by the  genetically polymorphic CYP2D6 isozyme. The activity of this isozyme is unaltered  by age, gender or smoking habits; however, it is subject to potent inhibition by  some of the frequently used medications in the elderly, such as the  antidepressants paroxetine and fluoxetine. This may result in an impairment in  O-demethylation of codeine to morphine and may lead to a decrease in the abuse  and dependence potential of codeine. Conversely, those with a very rapid CYP2D6  catalytic activity may have an increased potential for codeine abuse and  dependence. The clinical significance of age-related pharmacokinetic changes  should be evaluated within the context of clinical practice. Most physicians are  inclined to prescribe lower doses to the elderly, which may offset the potential  impact of altered pharmacokinetics on the abuse and dependence potential of  psychoactive agents. In summary, the available data are not sufficient for a  definitive conclusion on whether the pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly  translate to an increase in the abuse and dependence potential of alcohol,  benzodiazepines or opioids. In particular, the data on age-associated changes in  direct measures of abuse potential of these agents are missing. Future  comparative systemic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies assessing pertinent  outcome measures on abuse and dependence potential of commonly used psychoactive  drugs are required to resolve the ongoing controversy on risk factors for drug  abuse and dependence in the elderly.","1996-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","372-385","","5","31","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 9118585","","","","Humans; *Pharmacokinetics; Ethnicity; Ethanol/pharmacokinetics; Benzodiazepines/pharmacokinetics; *Aged; Substance-Related Disorders/*etiology; Narcotics/pharmacokinetics; Alcoholism/etiology; Opioid-Related Disorders/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS:  Changing patients to the oral osmotic system with hydromorphone at a ratio of 1:5  morphine equivalents usually led to good analgesia in one or two titration steps.  In a randomized, controlled study in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain,  the therapeutic results with oral osmotic hydromorphone once daily were  comparable to those of oxycodone twice daily. In addition, the patients in this  study showed clear improvement in the quality of life (WOMAC Osteoarthritis  Index) and sleep (MOS Sleep Assessment Questionnaire). Patients with chronic back  pain showed significantly reduced pain intensity, improved quality of life  (SF-36) and sleep (MOS Sleep Assessment Questionnaire) when treated with oral  osmotic hydromorphone.

The purpose of this review is to provide data  presenting the utility of forskolin--as a cAMP activator--for studying the  function of cAMP from different biological viewpoints as follows: 1)  Investigation on the role of cAMP in various cellular processes in different  organs such as gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, reproductive organs,  endocrine system, urinary system, olfactory system, nervous system, platelet  aggregating system, skin, bones, eyes, and smooth muscles. 2) Studies on the role  of cAMP activation and inhibition to understand the pathogenesis (e.g. thyroid  autoimmune disorders, leukocyte signal transduction defect in depression, acute  malaria infection, secretory dysfunction in inflammatory diseases) as well as its  possibly beneficial role for curing diseases such as the regulation of coronary  microvascular NO production after heart failure, the attenuation of the  development or progression of fibrosis in the heart and lungs, the augmentation  of myo-protective effects of ischemic preconditioning especially in the failing  hearts after myocardial infarction, the stimulation of the regeneration of  injured retinal ganglion cells, the curing of glaucoma and inflammatory diseases,  the reducing of cyst formation early in the polycystic kidney disease, and the  management of autoimmune disorders by enhancing Fas-mediated apoptosis. 3)  Studies on the role of cAMP in the mechanism of actions of a number of drugs and  substances such as the effect of the protoberberine alkaloid palmatine on the  active ion transport across rat colonic epithelium, the inhibitory effect of  retinoic acid on HIV-1-induced podocyte proliferation, the whitening activity of  luteolin, the effect of cilostazol on nitric oxide production, an effect that is  involved in capillary-like tube formation in human aortic endothelial cells, the  apoptotic effect of bullatacin, the effects of paraoxon and chlorpyrifos oxon on  nervous system. Moreover, cAMP was found to play a role in acute and chronic  exposure to ethanol, in morphine dependence and withdrawal and in behavioral  sensitization to cocaine as well as in the protection against cisplatin-induced  oxidative injuries.","2012-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","5-13","","1","67","","Pharmazie","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 22393824","","","","Humans; Animals; Drug Interactions; Pharmacokinetics; Cell Physiological Phenomena; Cyclic AMP/*physiology; Colforsin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inhibition occurred both in vivo following acute administration as a prolongation  of hexobarbital sleeping time and as an elevation of plasma hexobarbital levels,  and in vitro following addition to hepatic microsomes as a disruption of  ethyl-morphine N-demethylation and aniline p-hydroxylation. Inhibition of  ethylmorphine N-demethylation was of a mixed type, whereas aniline  p-hydroxylation was inhibited in a noncompetitive manner; the micromolar Ki  values obtained for both enzymes were severalfold lower than those obtained for  imidazole. Nafimidone alcohol produced a type II difference spectrum when added  to rat hepatic microsomes. The Ks value was 2.1 microM. Chronic administration of  nafimidone alcohol caused induction of hepatic drug metabolism typified by  shortening of pentobarbital sleeping time in vivo in male mice and a doubling of  hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 content in male rats. In rats, these changes  were associated with a 30-fold elevation in the Vmax for microsomal  ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and a moderate increase in the Vmax for microsomal  ethylmorphine N-demethylase, but no change in either the rate of aniline  p-hydroxylation, 4-hydroxybiphenyl- or 4-methylumbelliferone  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, or the activity of the flavoprotein reductase  component.

In recent years the focus has been more on the  treatment of chronic pain, perhaps ignoring the negative impact of acute pain on  quality of life and functional status of the patient, despite a growing number of  evidence indicating the need to treat optimally also acute pain to avoid it  prolongs in time. The remarkable progress achieved in the understanding of the  physiological mechanisms of the nociceptive stimulus, as well as those common to  biochemical inflammation and acute pain, highlighted the active and complex role  of central nervous system in the genesis and maintenance of pain that from acute,  if not promptly and adequately treated, can become chronic. In this article,  after a brief introduction on the most recent advances on the transition from  acute to chronic pain, we have focused on paracetamol, an analgesic drug widely  used for over a century for its demonstrated efficacy and tolerability.  Paracetamol that, thanks to a complex and not yet fully defined mechanism of  action, certainly localized in the central nervous system, can have a significant  role in the early treatment of acute pain aimed to reduce the risk of  chronicization. Pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic studies are  outlined, as well as the latest acquisitions in terms of metabolism of this drug  and the risks related to its misuse. Are also discussed the recommendations  issued by scientific societies and recent articles that indicate paracetamol as  the drug of first choice for mild to moderate pain in various clinical settings,  such as post-operative pain, post-traumatic and osteoarticular diseases, alone or  in association with weak opioids, in particular with codeine. Most recent  findings about metabolism and analgesic effect of codeine and its metabolites are  highlighted, and how, in combination with acetaminophen, there is an increase in  analgesic efficacy without increasing side effects, offering the chance of  obtaining a better pain control.","2014-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","501-513","","6","105","","Minerva Med","","","","","","","","ita","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 25392959","","","","Humans; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Half-Life; Drug Combinations; Pain/*drug therapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Nociceptors/drug effects; Contraindications; Inflammation/drug therapy; Activation, Metabolic; Synaptic Transmission/drug effects; Acetaminophen/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Codeine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/deficiency/genetics/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patient-controlled analgesia involves the mixing of different types of drugs.  When using patient-controlled analgesia, it is important to confirm the  microbiological and physicochemical stability of each drug in a mixture to  guarantee that the drug is delivered to the patient in an unaltered form.  OBJECTIVES: To confirm the microbiological and physicochemical stability of  various drug mixtures for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. STUDY DESIGN:  An in vitro protocol to examine the microbiological and physicochemical stability  of the most commonly used postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia  mixtures at our institution. SETTING: In vitro laboratory study. METHODS: Each  mixture contained a total of 4 drugs: fentanyl 400 µg, ketorolac 30 mg, either  hydromorphone 4 mg or oxycodone 10 mg, and either ramosetron 0.3 mg or  ondansetron 10 mg. Each mixture was placed in a portable patient-controlled  analgesia system containing 0.9% saline and stored at a constant temperature of  24°C for 96 hours. Physical properties (color, transparency, and sedimentation)  were observed with the naked eye and optical microscopy. Sterility testing was  performed to assess microbiological contamination in the drug mixture during the  96-hour study period. The pH of each mixture was evaluated for up to 96 hours  after mixing. The concentration of each drug was evaluated by high-performance  liquid chromatography every 24 hours until 96 hours after mixing. RESULTS: All  mixtures appeared visibly transparent, and no sediments were visible under the  microscope. Bacterial or fungal growth was not observed in any of the samples  after 14 days of incubation. The pH variations in all mixtures were maintained  within 0.25 over the 96-hour study period. The concentration of drugs, except  ketorolac, ranged from 90-110% of the initial concentration up to 96 hours after  mixing. In the mixtures with a pH of 4.21-4.39, the concentration of ketorolac  significantly decreased at 24 hours and 48 hours. LIMITATIONS: Confirmation of  the stability of drugs in vitro does not automatically ensure that the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs are not altered in vivo.  CONCLUSION: With the exception of ketorolac, the drugs used in the intravenous  patient-controlled analgesia drug mixtures in this study were physicochemically  stable up to 96 hours after mixing. The concentration of ketorolac decreased in  more acidic mixtures.","2021-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","E829-E837","","6","24","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34554703","","","","Humans; Benzimidazoles; Analgesics, Opioid; Fentanyl; *Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; stability; Ondansetron; Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy; oxycodone; Ketorolac; fentanyl; hydromorphone; Hydromorphone; *Oxycodone; ketorolac; Patient-controlled analgesia; multimodal analgesia; ondansetron; ramosetron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The PubMed,  Embase, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were searched. Eleven published  studies were identified and selected based on defined eligibility and exclusion  criteria. RESULTS: Four pharmacokinetic studies reported negligible plasma  concentrations of diacetylmorphine and its active metabolite 6-monacetylmorphine.  Among six pharmacodynamic studies, three trials showed that oral diacetylmorphine  reduced opioid withdrawal symptoms, one open-label pilot study reported that two  patients experienced a modest 'rush' after oral diacetylmorphine and two studies  found that patients could not distinguish between oral diacetylmorphine,  methadone, or morphine. Regarding the clinical studies, a Swiss prospective  cohort study in patients with heroin dependence showed high retention rates of  oral diacetylmorphine treatment with few serious adverse events, whereas in the  Canadian SALOME trial, oral diacetylmorphine treatment was prematurely  discontinued because treatment retention of oral diacetylmorphine was lower than  injectable diacetylmorphine maintenance treatment. Finally, two case studies  illustrate the limitations and potential problems of oral diacetylmorphine in the  treatment of treatment-refractory heroin dependent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based  on all published data, it is unlikely that oral diacetylmorphine produces a  substantial 'rush'. Prescription of oral diacetylmorphine might therefore be  effective only for treatment-refractory patients with heroin dependence (i) as  maintenance treatment for those who never injected or inhaled opioids; (ii) as  maintenance treatment for those who want to switch from injection to oral  administration of diacetylmorphine; and/or (iii) to reduce opioid withdrawal  symptoms.","2021-10-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","108984","","","227","","Drug Alcohol Depend","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Cancer & chemotherapy","","0385-0684","","","In 2010s, several opioids became available in Japan, including methadone, tapentadol and hydromorphone. Methadone was approved in September 2012 by  Japanese regulatory authority. Since methadone is positioned as so-calledstep 4  opioidin Japan, it must be prescribed as alternative opioid switched from another  of 60mg/day or greater equivalent dose of oral morphine. Diversity of  pharmacokinetics among individuals and various drug interactions require close  monitoring of adverse events. In spite of these cautions, unique characteristics  such as inhibiting N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA)and in- ducing  internalization/degradation of mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimers underline  the value of methadone in opioid switching. Tapentadol, a dual-acting opioid  which inhibits noradrenaline(norepinephrine)reuptake, was approved in Japan in  March 2014. In a double-blind randomized study comparing with oxycodone,  tapentadol showed relatively better tolerability. Advantages such as having no  active metabolites and minimal drug interactions also ease the administration of  tapentadol to the patients with comorbidities. Hydromorphone, approved in March  2017, has a profile similar to morphine. Higher potency than morphine lead to  less production of 3-glucronide metabolite(H3G)which accumulates in patients with  renal failure and causes neurotoxicity. Because there is no concluding evidence  about effect of hydromorphone on dyspnea or tolerability in patients with renal  insufficiency, organized studies are still needed. We expect these ""new in Japan""  opioids contribute to long-term, stable pain control for patients with cancer.","2018-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","205-211","","2","45","","Gan To Kagaku Ryoho","","","","","","","","jpn","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 29483406","","","","Humans; Methadone/*therapeutic use; Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use; Tapentadol; Receptors, Opioid/metabolism; *Pain Management; Hydromorphone/*therapeutic use; Phenols/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition","","0148-6071","10.1177/0148607101025006330","","BACKGROUND: The choice of treatment options in short bowel syndrome (SBS) is hampered by a lack of comparative studies. This study uses a previously validated  juvenile pig model of SBS to compare nontreated controls (C), surgical treatment  with either proximal colon interposition (CI) or bowel lengthening (BL), with  medical treatment with codeine and cimetidine (M). METHODS: Treatment was  initiated 6 weeks after resection of 75% of the small bowel, and animals were  followed until sacrifice at week 16. Feed intake and weight gain were monitored  throughout; in vivo nutrient absorption, in vitro nutrient transport,  sodium-glucose cotransporter activity, and intestinal morphology (gross and  microscopic) were examined at the end of treatment. RESULTS: BL and M treatments  resulted in improved rates of weight gain; this improvement was associated with  improved absorption of dietary fat. The treatments did not affect carbohydrate or  protein absorption in vivo. In vitro fatty acid absorption was not increased in  any group. Active uptake of glucose was increased in the colon interposition  group, but phlorizin binding (reflecting sodium glucose cotransporter activity)  did not differ between groups. Gross serosal and microscopic mucosal surface  areas increased in all groups; however, there were no significant differences  between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that bowel  lengthening and medical treatment improved the rate of weight gain in this model  of SBS. This appeared to be due to improvement in the absorption of dietary fat,  which was not caused by alterations in in vitro uptake or mucosal surface area,  suggesting these treatments have their affects by altering motility or  intraluminal digestion. These findings suggest that these treatments are worthy  of further study in treating patients (primary pediatric) with SBS.","2001-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","330-336","","6","25","","JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11688937","","","","Female; Animals; Intestinal Absorption; Disease Models, Animal; Treatment Outcome; Swine; Drug Therapy, Combination; Weight Gain; Narcotics/therapeutic use; Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Cimetidine/therapeutic use; Dietary Fats/*pharmacokinetics; Intestinal Mucosa/physiology; Codeine/therapeutic use; Short Bowel Syndrome/*drug therapy/*surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urinary  metabolic ratios of hydrocodone/hydromorphone were highly correlated with  O-demethylation ratios for dextromethorphan, an established marker drug of CYP2D6  activity (rs = 0.85; n = 18). The kinetics of hydrocodone after a single oral  dose and its partial metabolic clearance to hydromorphone were investigated in  five extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, six poor metabolizers, and four  extensive metabolizers after pretreatment with quinidine, a selective inhibitor  of CYP2D6 activity. The mean values for partial metabolic clearance by  O-demethylation in the three groups were 28.1 +/- 10.3, 3.4 +/- 2.4, and 5.0 +/-  3.6 ml/hr/kg, respectively. No statistically significant phenotypic differences  in physiologic measures were observed. However, over the first hour after dosing,  the extensive metabolizers reported more ""good opiate effects"" and fewer ""bad  opiate effects"" than poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers in whom CYP2D6  was inhibited by quinidine. These data establish the importance of CYP2D6 in the  formation of hydromorphone from hydrocodone and suggest that the activity of this  enzyme may limit the abuse liability of hydrocodone.","1993-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","463-472","","5","54","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7693389","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenotype; Reference Values; In Vitro Techniques; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics/metabolism; Mixed Function Oxygenases/*genetics/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6; Microsomes, Liver/*enzymology; Mutation; Hydromorphone/*metabolism; Hydrocodone/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From therapeutic point of view, the participation of  UGTs in drug metabolism is of particular significance. Polymorphism of UGT1A and  UGT2B genes resulted in various susceptibility of substrates to conjugation with  glucuronic acid. Deactivation of xenobiotics and the following excretion of  hydrophilic conjugates is a common task of glucuronidation, which should lead to  detoxification. However, a lot of glucuronides were known, which expressed the  comparable or even higher reactivity than that of the native compound. There are,  among others, acyl glucuronides of carboxylic acids, morphine 6-O-glucuronide or  retinoid glucuronides.

Inhibition of specific binding of  tritiated PCP, morphine, or quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) in rat brain  homogenates was measured for these compounds. Inhibition of PCP binding for  selected compounds correlated with mouse rotarod assay activity. The most  characteristic effects of hydroxylation of PCP on the cyclohexyl, piperidine, or  phenyl moieties are the following: (i) it generally decreases its activity in  inhibiting [3H]PCP binding by a factor of 10 to 80; (ii) it does not produce a  large variation in the affinity for the morphine receptor; (iii) it produces a  considerable decrease of the affinity for the muscarinic receptor. An important  exception to these general observations was the metaphenolic derivative of PCP.  This PCP derivative has an affinity for the [3H]PCP binding sites that is 8 times  higher than that of PCP itself; its affinity for the muscarinic receptor is only  twice lower than that of PCP, but its affinity for the morphine receptor is 430  times higher than that of PCP and only one order of magnitude lower than that of  morphine itself.","1982-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","431-435","","4","25","","J Med Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6279847","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Mice; Biotransformation; Stereoisomerism; Hydroxylation; Chemistry; Chemical Phenomena; Molecular Conformation; Binding, Competitive; Receptors, Opioid/metabolism; Phencyclidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology; Receptors, Muscarinic/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this evidence, few studies have assessed opioid receptor expression in  identified cells within germinal zones or examined opioid effects on gliogenesis  in vivo. To address this question, the role of opioids was explored in the  subventricular zone (SVZ) and/or striatum of 2-5-day-old and/or adult ICR mice.  The results showed that subpopulations of neurons, astrocytes, and  oligodendrocytes in the SVZ and striatum differentially express mu-, delta-,  and/or kappa-receptor immunoreactivity in a cell type-specific and  developmentally regulated manner. In addition, DNA synthesis was assessed by  examining 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into glial and nonglial  precursors. Morphine (a preferential mu-agonist) significantly decreased the  number of BrdU-labeled GFAP(+) cells compared with controls or mice co-treated  with naltrexone plus morphine. Alternatively, in S100beta(+) cells, morphine did  not significantly decrease BrdU incorporation; however, significant differences  were noted between mice treated with morphine and those treated with morphine  plus naltrexone. Most cells were GFAP(-)/S100beta(-). When BrdU incorporation was  assessed within the total population (glia and nonglia), morphine had no net  effect, but naltrexone alone markedly increased BrdU incorporation. This finding  suggests that DNA synthesis in GFAP(-)/S100beta(-) cells is tonically suppressed  by endogenous opioids. Assuming that S100beta and GFAP, respectively, distinguish  among younger and older astroglia, this implies that astroglial replication  becomes increasingly sensitive to morphine during maturation, and suggests that  opioids differentially regulate the development of distinct subpopulations of  glia and glial precursors.","2001-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","78-88","","1","36","","Glia","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11571786  PMCID: PMC4303466","","","","Animals; Mice; Immunohistochemistry; Aging/physiology; Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism; Antigens, Surface/metabolism; Morphine/pharmacology; Astrocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism; Naltrexone/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid/drug effects/*metabolism; Amino Acid Transport System X-AG/metabolism; *S100 Proteins; Animals, Newborn/anatomy & histology/growth & development/metabolism; Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacokinetics; Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism; Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology; Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism; Lateral Ventricles/cytology/*growth & development/metabolism; Mice, Inbred ICR/anatomy & histology/growth & development/metabolism; Neostriatum/cytology/*growth & development/metabolism; Nerve Growth Factors/metabolism; Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism; Oligodendroglia/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism; Opioid Peptides/metabolism; S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Covariate influences have been accounted for using  allometry (size) and maturation of oxycodone clearance with age. The target  concentration is dependent on pain intensity that may differ over pain duration  or between individuals. METHODS: We assumed a target concentration of  35 mcg.L(-1) (acceptable range ±20%) to be associated with adequate analgesia  without increased risk of adverse effects from respiratory depression.  Pharmacokinetic simulation was used to estimate dose in neonates through to obese  adults given intravenous or parenteral oxycodone. RESULTS: There were 84% of  simulated oxycodone concentrations within the acceptable range during maintenance  dosing. Variability around the simulated target concentration decreased with age.  The maturation of oxycodone clearance is reflected in changes to  context-sensitive halftime where clearance is immature in neonates compared with  older children and adults. The intravenous loading and maintenance doses for a  typical 5-year-old child are 100 mcg.kg(-1) and 33 mcg.kg(-1) .h(-1) . In a  typical adult, the loading dose is 100 mcg.kg(-1) and maintenance dose  23 mcg.kg(-1) .h(-1) . CONCLUSION: Simulation was used to suggest loading and  maintenance doses to attain an oxycodone concentration of 35 mcg.L(-1) predicted  in adults. Although the covariates age and weight contribute 92% variability for  clearance, there remains variability accounting for 16% of concentrations outside  the target range. Duration of analgesic effect after ceasing infusion is  anticipated to be longer in neonates where context-sensitive halftime is greater  than older children and adults.","2021-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1325-1331","","12","31","","Paediatr Anaesth","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 34469616","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; pharmacokinetics; Young Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Infant, Newborn; toxicity; Analgesics, Opioid; pharmacodynamics; Pain Management; *Analgesia; children; oxycodone; analgesia; Oxycodone; pain; *Acute Pain/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To compare three pharmacologic protocols for opioid  detoxification in a primary care setting. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind  clinical trial with random assignment to treatment protocols. SETTING: A  free-standing primary care clinic affiliated with drug treatment programs.  PATIENTS: 162 heroin-dependent patients. INTERVENTIONS: Three detoxification  protocols: donidine, combined donidine and naltrexone, and buprenorphine.  MEASUREMENTS: Successful detoxification (that is, when study participants  received a full opioid-blocking dose [50 mg] of naltrexone), treatment retention  (8 days), and withdrawal symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 65% of participants (36 of  55) who received clonidine, 81% (44 of 54) who received combined clonidine and  naltrexone, and 81% (43 of 53) who received buprenorphine were successfully  detoxified.

METHODS: Sixteen volunteers entered a three-way cross-over trial in which  absorption of probe markers from a timed-release delivery system was determined  following treatment with lactulose 20 mls tds (increasing water content), or  codeine 30 gms qds (decreasing water content), and compared with control  untreated values. Stool water content was assessed by freeze drying stool  samples. Site of release was determined by gamma scintigraphy, and absorption was  measured by plasma levels and urinary recovery of the marker probes. RESULTS:  Lactulose accelerated ascending colon transit (3.7 +/- 0.8 vs 4.5 +/- 1.4 hrs, p  < 0.05), increased stool water content (75 +/- 2 vs 71 +/- 2%, p < 0.01), caused  greater dispersion of released material (dispersion score 3.4 +/- 0.3 vs 1.8 +/-  0.2, p < 0.01), and enhanced absorption of the transcellular probe quinine (4.66  +/- 0.78 vs 3.02 +/- 0.63%, p < 0.05) compared to control. Conversely codeine  slowed ascending colon transit (8.9 +/- 1.8 hrs), reduced stool water content (61  +/- 2 vs 71.2%, p < 0.05), and tended to diminish absorption (2.60 +/- 0.77 vs  3.02 +/- 0.63%, p = 0.20). Within the ascending colon specifically, there was a  significant trend for treatments increasing luminal water content to enhance  quinine absorption (medians: codeine = 1.2%, [n = 81 < control = 2.3%, [n = 5] <  lactulose = 3.2%, [n = 71, p < 0.01). Delivery site also had an important  influence on absorption, with more distal release resulting in less absorption in  the control arm (medians: small intestine = 4.4% [n = 5] > ascending colon = 2.3%  [n = 5] > transverse colon = 1.5% [n = 6], p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Lactulose  accelerates transit, increases stool water content, and enhances drug absorption  from the distal gut whilst codeine slows transit, decreases stool water content,  and tends to diminish absorption, compared to controls. We conclude that water  content may be an important determinant in colonic drug absorption.","1999-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1254-1259","","8","16","","Pharm Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10468028","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Cross-Over Studies; Cell Membrane Permeability; Intestinal Absorption/*drug effects; Drug Delivery Systems; Diffusion; Feces/*chemistry; Body Water/*metabolism; Lactulose/*pharmacology; Edetic Acid/pharmacokinetics; Codeine/*pharmacology; Colon/drug effects/*metabolism; Quinine/pharmacokinetics; Resins, Synthetic/chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subjects received in random double-blind fashion 120 mg of  codeine plus placebo, 120 mg of codeine plus 100 mg of quinidine and 100 mg of  quinidine plus placebo. Blood was obtained over 24 hr and urine was collected for  48 hr. Respiratory, psychomotor and pupillary effects of codeine were greater in  the EMs than in the PMs (P < .01). Morphine and morphine metabolites were  detectable only in plasma from EMs. Codeine metabolic clearance by  O-demethylation was almost 200-fold greater in the EMs than in the PMs. After  coadministration of quinidine, morphine and morphine metabolites were not  detectable in the plasma of either phenotype and mean (+/- S.E.M.)

Thus, CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation of codeine to  morphine is central to its pharmacodynamic effects. Patients who lack CYP2D6 or  whose CYP2D6 is inhibited would not be expected to benefit from codeine.

Atropine and codeine (10 mg/kg s.c.) blocked or at  least delayed the diarrhea produced by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic  acid. The antidiarrheal activity of codeine was found to be more potent and  longer-lasting than that of atropine. Both drugs delayed the passage of  chenodeoxycholic acid containing gastric fluid into the duodenum, but neither of  them prevented chenodeoxycholic acid-induced jejunal secretion of fluid and  electrolytes. These results indicate that the diarrheal excretion by  chenodeoxycholic acid was ascribable to the impairment of fluid absorption in the  colonic mucosa and partly to the activation of gastro-intestinal propulsive  motility.","1979-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","328-339","","2","240","","Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Belgium PMID: 508013","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Intestinal Absorption; Codeine/*pharmacology; Analgesia; Pupil/drug effects; Diarrhea/*chemically induced; Atropine/*pharmacology; Body Fluids/drug effects; Chenodeoxycholic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Codeine is a substrate of CYP2D6, a genetically polymorphic  P450 enzyme, and is metabolized to the more potent drug morphine. CYP2D6 activity  can be inhibited by fluoxetine, and the inhibition of morphine formation may help  individuals reduce their use of codeine. Fourteen long-term users of oral opiates  (principally codeine) were assessed for an open-label pilot treatment study of  fluoxetine 20 mg/day combined with a brief behavioral intervention and structured  tapering of the opiate. Eight subjects entered and completed the 8-week  treatment. Opiate use decreased by 30% to 100% of baseline use (p < 0.0001) in  parallel with a decrease in CYP2D6 activity. Fluoxetine may have a role in the  treatment of opiate dependence by decreasing opiate-reinforcing properties.","2000-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","43-45","","1","20","","J Clin Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10653207","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Analysis of Variance; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/metabolism; Pilot Projects; *Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors; Codeine/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Fluoxetine/*therapeutic use; Opioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acute toxicity of thebaine is fairly high, but not much is known  about chronic toxicity. To investigate the genotoxicity of thebaine,  cytokinesis-block micronucleus test and comet assay were conducted in TK6 cells.  In addition, effects of putative thebaine metabolites were analysed using  metabolically active HepG2 cells and TK6 cells with S9 mix. FDA test and trypan  blue test were used together with the frequency of mitotic and apoptotic cells to  assess potential cytotoxicity of thebaine treatment. Micronucleus induction was  observed after high doses (150 and 500 μM) of thebaine without metabolic  activation in the presence of slight to moderate cytotoxicity. No effects were  observed in the comet assay or after metabolic activation up to the highest dose  of 500 μM. A potential protective effect on micronucleus induction after thebaine  treatment was investigated via co-treatment with MMC and BaP in TK6 cells. Only  after co-treatment with MMC, a reduction of micronucleus frequency was found.  Overall, this study shows a potential of thebaine to induce genotoxic effects at  high concentrations. The observation of cytotoxicity at these concentrations  supports the hypothesis that genotoxicity may be caused by cytotoxic effects.  Further studies will need to elucidate whether these effects are directly  genotoxic or indeed result from cytotoxicity.","2021-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","503393","","","870-871","","Mutat Res Genet Toxicol Environ Mutagen","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The enzymatic  O-demethylation of codeine is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), leading  to the production of metabolites (morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide) that are  pharmacologically more potent than codeine. A placebo-controlled, single-blind  study was conducted to characterize the subjective effects of codeine associated  with abuse liability and to determine the importance of metabolic O-demethylation  to codeine abuse liability. Twelve non-drug-dependent subjects received oral  administration of placebo and codeine 60, 120, and 180 mg, and a favorite dose  (FD) was determined for each subject. The FD was readministered after  pretreatment with placebo, 50 mg of quinidine (a specific, selective CYP2D6  inhibitor) once, or 50 mg of quinidine given four times a day for 4 days.  Single-dose quinidine pretreatment significantly decreased the recovery of  O-demethylated metabolites in plasma (p < 0.01) and resulted in a decrease in the  positive (e.g., ""high,"" p < 0.05) and negative (e.g., nausea, p < 0.05)  subjective effects of codeine in both the FD120 and FD180 groups. Short-term  quinidine pretreatment inhibited codeine O-demethylation more than did  single-dose quinidine pretreatment (p < 0.01), and it decreased positive codeine  effects in the FD120 group (N = 7), but unexpectedly not in the FD180 group (N =  5). These results suggest that the O-demethylated metabolites contribute  substantially to the subjective effects and abuse liability of codeine.","2000-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","435-444","","4","20","","J Clin Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10917405","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Time Factors; Reproducibility of Results; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Single-Blind Method; Dealkylation; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics; *Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors; Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics; Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Narcotics/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Pupil/drug effects; Opioid-Related Disorders/*prevention & control; Codeine/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Quinidine/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is indicated for use in patients with severe pain and contraindicated  in those with acute or post-operative pain. In several, randomized, multicentre,  phase III trials, oral OROS hydromorphone administered once daily for up to 52  weeks was generally effective in the treatment of patients with chronic, moderate  to severe cancer or nonmalignant/noncancer pain with regard to improvements from  baseline to endpoint in patient-assessed measures of pain intensity, pain relief  and/or functional impairment. Pharmacoeconomic analyses suggest that OROS  hydromorphone provides greater cost utility than other opioids in this patient  population. In addition, OROS hydromorphone was generally well tolerated in  clinical trials, with most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity and  similar to those seen with other opioids.

DESIGN: An  enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial design was used whereby patients  entered a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial after completing an  open-label titration phase. SETTING: Sixty-one US clinics. PATIENTS: All patients  (40-75 years) had experienced moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritic pain in  the hip or knee for > or = 3 months. INTERVENTIONS: During 2 weeks of open-label  treatment (N = 558), patients were titrated from Remoxy 5 mg twice daily (bid) to  20 mg bid. Patients who tolerated the drug were randomly assigned to Remoxy or  placebo bid for 12 weeks. Dose titration was permitted during weeks 1-4 (range,  10-80 mg/d) and fixed thereafter. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The area under the curve  (AUC) for change in pain intensity (PI) scores from prerandomization to the end  of the 12-week period was the primary endpoint. Patient assessment of quality of  analgesia, global assessment of study medication, quality of life, and safety  were also evaluated. RESULTS: The mean AUC for change in PI score was  significantly greater for Remoxy than for placebo (p = 0.007).

However, the prevalence of drug misuse, abuse, and addiction has  fostered considerable consternation among physicians, who may hesitate to  prescribe these medications both due to concern for patients (misuse, abuse, and  addiction), and fears of prosecution and/or professional sanction. Such practice  may reflect 1) inadequate knowledge about patients' susceptibility to, or current  drug misuse or abuse; 2) lack of familiarity with extant assessments and/or  regulations, and/or 3) an unanticipated reaction to existing guidelines, policies  or laws. We posit that assessing patients' predisposition to, and patterns of,  drug misuse/abuse is a vital first step toward establishing and maintaining the  safe and effective use of opioid analgesics in the treatment of chronic pain.  Adherence monitoring is critical to identify patients' prior and current drug  use, establish treatment basis, and evaluate compliance, so as to avoid misuse  and abuse, and ensure sound and proper pain management. This paper provides a  review of the numerous monitoring approaches that have been described in the  literature and addresses the benefits and limitations of these techniques and  tools. The complex nature of the problem of drug misuse and abuse is discussed,  and while no single monitoring technique can fully address this complex issue, we  describe how multiple approaches to adherence monitoring may be employed to  sustain the prudent use of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain.","2008-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","S155-180","","2 Suppl","11","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18443638","","","","Humans; Drug Monitoring/methods; Chronic Disease; Patient Compliance; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Codeine/pharmacokinetics; Heroin/pharmacokinetics; Pain/*drug therapy/psychology; Hydrocodone/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although hydromorphone has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, it is  unclear whether hydromorphone provides better patient-centered benefits compared  to fentanyl. The objective of this study is to compare opioid and sedative  requirements in ECMO patients started on a fentanyl- versus hydromorphone-based  analgesia regimen. METHODS: This was a non-interventional retrospective cohort  study. It was conducted at a single center in the cardiovascular intensive care  units and cardiac intensive care units. We included venovenous (VV) or  venoarterial ECMO patients. Patients who were started on a fentanyl continuous  infusion within 24 h of cannulation were compared to patients started on a  hydromorphone continuous infusion. RESULTS: A linear mixed effects model was  performed to compare doses of opioid, sedative, and propofol between groups over  time. We included 28 hydromorphone patients and 53 fentanyl patients, with 85% on  VV ECMO. There were no differences between hydromorphone and fentanyl groups in  opioid or sedative (including propofol and benzodiazepine) doses for any ECMO day  (p value for interaction .63 and .83, respectively). Propofol doses alone,  however, were significantly higher in the fentanyl group on ECMO days three,  four, and five.

The enk-induced  inhibition in rats pretreated with any combination of two PIs, however, were  markedly smaller than that in rats pretreated with all three PIs, indicating that  three kinds of enzymes all played important roles in the inactivation of enk.

However, it remains  unclear whether opioid transmission is also essential to experience pleasure with  more abstract rewards, such as music. We addressed this question using a  double-blind within-subject pharmacological design in which opioid levels were  up- and downregulated by administering an opioid agonist (oxycodone) and  antagonist (naltrexone), respectively, before healthy participants (n = 21)  listened to music. Participants also performed a monetary incentive delay (MID)  task to control for the effectiveness of the treatment and the specificity of the  effects. Our results revealed that the pharmacological intervention did not  modulate subjective reports of pleasure, nor the occurrence of chills. On the  contrary, psychophysiological (objective) measures of emotional arousal, such as  skin conductance responses (SCRs), were bidirectionally modulated in both the  music and MID tasks. This modulation specifically occurred during reward  consumption, with greater pleasure-related SCR following oxycodone than  naltrexone. These findings indicate that opioid transmission does not modulate  subjective evaluations but rather affects objective reward-related  psychophysiological responses. These findings raise new caveats about the role of  the opioidergic system in the modulation of pleasure for more abstract or  cognitive forms of rewarding experiences, such as music.","2023-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","105-114","","1","1520","","Ann N Y Acad Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

The rat lymphocyte culture was established as a  suspension culture after the isolation of the cells from the spleen of male  wistar rats by mechanical disaggregation and density gradient centrifugation with  a yield of 10(7) cells per spleen and a viability of 80%. The addition of the  mitogens PHA and Con A to the culture stimulated the proliferation of the  lymphocytes leading to a doubling of the number of cells comparing with control  cultures. Myeloma cells are a permanent cell line of B-lymphocytes. The  cultivation was carried out as stationary suspension. The marked proliferation of  the cells could be increased by addition of Con A. The biochemical properties of  both kinds of cells are qualitatively comparable. Cytochrome P-450 mediated  demethylase activities could be detected, which were 5-10 fold higher in myeloma  cells. The pretreatment with the enzyme inductors phenobarbitone and  3-methylcholanthrene as well as the addition of the mitogens PHA and Con A  increased these turnover rates. Reductive and conjugating activities were not  present in the cultures.

Numeric pain intensity  scores (0-10), mean total hydrocodone dosing, and quantitative blood nicotine and  hydrocodone levels were assessed at the beginning and end of this study. Patients  kept daily diaries and recorded pain scores and self hydrocodone dosing upon  awakening, in the afternoon, and at bed time. Parametric and nonparametric  statistical analysis was performed using the appropriate test with p < or = 0.05  necessary to reject the null hypothesis There were no differences in demographics  between the two groups. Smokers had higher end of study pain scores and required  more hydrocodone than non-smokers but had significantly lower serum levels of  hydrocodone than non-smokers.

Thermal thresholds were measured  after IM administration of hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg), butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg), a  combination of butorphanol and hydromorphone (0.4 and 0.1 mg/kg), or saline to  each of 6 cats in a randomized, blinded, crossover study design. There were at  least 12 days between treatments. Thermal thresholds were measured by a  thorax-mounted thermal threshold-testing device specifically developed for cats.  Thermal thresholds were measured before treatment, at varying intervals to 12  hours, and at 24 hours after treatments. Data were analyzed by an analysis of  variance with a repeat factor of time. Dysphoria was associated with butorphanol  administration but not with hydromorphone or hydromorphone-butorphanol combined  administration. Vomiting was seen with hydromorphone but not with butorphanol or  hydromorphone-butorphanol combined. The control treatment group was stable over  time (P = .22; mean threshold, 40.1 degrees C). Thresholds were significantly (P  < .05) higher than the control treatment between 15 and 165 minutes for  butorphanol, between 15 and 345 minutes for hydromorphone, and between 15 and 540  minutes for hydromorphone-butorphanol combined. The addition of butorphanol to  hydromorphone decreased the intensity of antinociception during the 1st 2 hours  but extended the duration of observable antinociception from 5.75 to 9 hours. The  present study suggests that the combination of butorphanol and a pure OP3 (mu)  receptor agonist clinically does not produce increased analgesia and indeed may  result in decreased analgesia.","2004-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","190-195","","2","18","","J Vet Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15058769","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Drug Therapy, Combination; Cats/*metabolism; Hydromorphone/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Body Temperature/*drug effects; Analgesics/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Butorphanol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS:  A total of 40 adult horses admitted for elective arthroscopy. METHODS: Horses  were randomly assigned to be administered intravenous hydromorphone (0.04 mg  kg(-1); group TxH; n = 19) or butorphanol (0.02 mg kg(-1); group TxB; n = 21)  prior to surgery as part of a standardized anesthetic protocol. Pain was scored  by two observers unaware of group assignment using the Equine Utrecht University  Scale for Facial Assessment of Pain (EQUUS-FAP) and a composite pain scale (CPS)  prior to surgery (baseline), 2 hours (P2) and 4 hours (P4) following recovery  from anesthesia. Blood samples were collected at various time points for  determination of plasma hydromorphone concentration using liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed with a mixed-effect  model. RESULTS: Median (range) baseline EQUUS-FAP was 1.2 (0.0-4.0) with no  effect of group, time points or interaction. Baseline CPS was similar between  groups. Group TxH baseline CPS was 2.5 (0.0-10.0), increased at P2 [4.5 (0-10.0);  p = 0.046] and returned to baseline values at P4 [3.0 (0.0-11.0)].

Quantitative measurement of opioids  and their metabolites in urine is used mainly for confirmation of screened  results obtained for clinical and forensic purposes. Due to limitations in  interpretation of urine results for pain management testing purposes, the use of  blood or serum to assess opioids and their metabolites may be of benefit. This  report describes a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  method for the detection of hydrocodone and its metabolites hydromorphone,  norhydrocodone, and dihydrocodeine, and other common opiates that patients may be  taking, including morphine, codeine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone in a single  extraction. The method uses solid-phase extraction of 500 µL of sample with  quantitation by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The assay is  linear from 1.0 to 100 ng/mL and has a between-day coefficient of variation of  <10%. The major advantage of this method is that a single extraction can detect  hydrocodone and its metabolites and other opiates or opioids that patients  frequently use simultaneously with hydrocodone.","2013-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","352-359","","3","35","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23666565","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Drug Monitoring; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods; Chromatography, Liquid/*methods; Solid Phase Extraction; Pain/drug therapy; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics; Hydrocodone/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: An Institutional  Review Board-approved, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo, and  active-controlled, four-way crossover study of intranasal REMOXY ER gel,  manipulated or intact, and ground oxycodone immediate-release (IR). An open label  extension examined pharmacokinetics of OxyContin® ER in the first 20 subjects.  PARTICIPANTS: Healthy, adult nondependent recreational opioid users with a  history of intranasal abuse. Thirty-eight subjects enrolled; 36 completed.  SETTING: A clinical research in-patient unit. INTERVENTIONS: Cross-over arms  included nasal self-administration of the entire contents of REMOXY ER 40 mg  capsules (manipulated or intact), ground oxycodone IR 40 mg tablets, and placebo.  The open-label arm was ground OxyContin ER. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary  endpoint was the maximum effect (E(max)) of visual analog scale ratings of Drug  Liking. Secondary endpoints included Take Drug Again (12 and 24 hours), Drug High  E(max), area under effect curves through 12 hours, pupillometry, peak oxycodone  concentrations (C(max)), time to maximum concentration (T(max)), and Abuse  Quotient (C(max)/T(max)). RESULTS: Intranasal REMOXY ER (manipulated or intact)  elicited lower Drug Liking and Drug High compared to ground oxycodone IR.  Secondary endpoints also reflected reduced Abuse Potential. Intranasal REMOXY ER  (manipulated or intact) led to fourfold lower C(max), a 57 to 128 percent longer  T(max), a >10-fold lower Abuse Quotient and lower Take Drug Again scores compared  to both OxyContin ER and oxycodone IR. CONCLUSION: In this study, REMOXY ER  demonstrated significantly lower nasal abuse potential compared to oxycodone IR  or OxyContin ER. PERSPECTIVE: Abuse-deterrent drugs are intended to help fight  opioid abuse. Yet the persistence of the opioid epidemic indicates that vast  improvements in abuse-deterrent technology are needed.

However, their usefulness is  limited by the production of a range of adverse effects such as constipation,  respiratory depression, tolerance and physical dependence. In addition, opioids  generally exhibit poor efficacy against neuropathic pain. Endomorphin-1 and -2,  two endogenous opioid peptides, have been shown to produce potent antinociception  in rodent models of acute and neuropathic pain with less undesirable side effects  than opioid alkaloids. However, native endomorphins are poorly suited to clinical  applications without modifications. Like all small peptides, endomorphins suffer  from poor metabolic stability and a relative inability to penetrate the  gastro-intestinal mucosa and blood-brain-barrier. Since the discovery of  endomorphins in 1997, a huge number of endomorphin analogs have been designed and  synthesized with the aim of developing compounds with improved barrier  penetration and resistance to enzymatic degradation. In this review we describe  various strategies that have been adopted so far to conquer the major drawbacks  associated with endomorphins. They include chemical modifications to produce  locally or globally-restricted peptide analogs in addition to application of  peptidase inhibitors, which is of minor importance compared to the former  strategy. Diverse approaches that resulted in the design and synthesis of  pharmacologically active endomorphin analogs with less adverse effects are also  discussed giving an insight into the development of opioid peptides with an  improved side effect profile.","2013","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","2741-2758","","22","20","","Curr Med Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 23590712","","","","Humans; Animals; Biological Availability; Oligopeptides/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, mu/agonists; Receptors, Opioid, kappa/agonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rank order of potency among  opioidbenzomorphans and phencyclidine (PCP) analogs for competition for  [3H](d)-NANM-binding sites is as follows: (d)-NANM = PCP-3-OH greater than  (d)-cyclazocine greater than N-ethylphenylcyclohexylamine greater than PCP  greater than (l)-cyclazocine = dextrorphan greater than  (d/l)-ethylketocyclazocine greater than (d/l)-bremazocine greater than (1)-NANM  greater than 1-phenylcyclohexylamine greater than levorphanol. Other opioid  ligands, relatively selective for each of the types of opioid binding sites other  than sigma, such as morphine (mu), H-Tyr-D-Ala(Me)Phe-NH-CH2-OH (mu),  D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin (delta), tifluadom (kappa), and U 50488 (kappa) as well  as etorphine and naloxone were all unable to compete with [3H](d)-NANM for  specific binding even at a concentration of 1 microM. Regional distribution  studies of [3H](d)-NANM-binding sites show high density in the hippocampus,  thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala and low density in cerebellum and nonfrontal  neocortex membranes of the rat brain. These binding sites are very sensitive to  protein-modifying enzymes and reagents such as trypsin and N-ethylmaleimide and  to heat denaturation. These results provide direct biochemical evidence for the  existence of distinct (d)-NANM-binding sites in rat brain. In addition, this  study supports the view that PCP and several of its analogues and the  dextrorotatory isomers of psychotomimetic benzomorphans may act at a common  recognition site in rat central nervous system.","1985-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","46-52","","1","27","","Mol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3965930","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Tritium; Rats, Inbred Strains; Binding Sites; Tissue Distribution; Brain/*metabolism; Binding, Competitive; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Phenazocine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specific conditions for TDM to be reasonably  applied include the availability of a validated assay, a considerable  interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, a high correlation between drug  concentration and toxicity, and a narrow therapeutic index. Cancer patients are  especially prone to drug-drug interactions due to significant comedication,  impaired liver and kidney function and hypoalbuminemia with altered drug binding.  This article discusses TDM for various broadly used non-anticancer drugs in  cancer patients and gives specific recommendations. Selected drugs covered in  this article include those regularly used in febrile neutropenic patients such as  the glycopeptide antibiotics, aminoglycosides, the antifungal agents, including  flucytosine and azole compounds, the anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine and  valproate, the tricyclic antidepressants, selective-serotonin-reuptake  inhibitors, lithium, morphine, digitalis glycosides and the immunosupressants  cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, crucial compounds  in the setting of bone marrow transplantation. In all cases, treating physicians  have to consider the variability in patient age, disease stage, comedication,  organ function and protein level to weigh the pros and cons of TDM in the  individual cancer patient.","2004-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","531-545","","7","26","","Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 15538543","","","","Humans; Biological Availability; *Drug Interactions; Liver/drug effects/metabolism; Anticonvulsants/pharmacokinetics; Drug Monitoring/*methods; Kidney/drug effects/metabolism; Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Antifungal Agents/*pharmacokinetics; *Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism; Aminoglycosides/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isolated incidences of suspected association between  hydrocodone abuse and rapidly progressive hearing loss have been reported. In  this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of 5 patients presenting  with progressive hearing loss and a history of hydrocodone use. METHODS: Patients  presenting with rapidly progressive bilateral hearing loss who had a documented  history of hydrocodone use were selected for the study. The presentation,  audiologic findings, associated comorbidities, and treatment outcomes were  reviewed. RESULTS: All patients displayed rapidly progressive sensorineural  hearing loss without vestibular symptoms. Hearing loss was asymmetric in 3  patients at initial presentation, but progressed to profound loss, usually within  months. Steroid treatment has no effect on the progression of the hearing loss.  The admitted quantity of hydrocodone consumed ranged from 10 to 300 mg per day.  Hepatitis C was the most common comorbidity, present in 60% of the patients. All  patients underwent cochlear implantation with satisfactory results. CONCLUSIONS:  The chronic use of hydrocodone can be associated with progressive sensorineural  hearing loss. Successful auditory rehabilitation can be achieved with cochlear  implantation. Genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes as well as  associated comorbidities such as hepatitis C infection may be significant in the  development of hydrocodone ototoxicity, though additional investigations are  necessary.","2007-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","467-472","","3","10","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17525781","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics; Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics; Drug Therapy, Combination; Comorbidity; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Acetaminophen/adverse effects; Hydrocodone/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Cochlea/drug effects/physiopathology; Cochlear Implants; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/*chemically induced/physiopathology; Hepatitis C/epidemiology; Neurotoxins/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the PB Group (n = 28) placebo was given on days 1-7 and  naltrexone on day 8. Main outcome measures were Observed Opioid Withdrawal scores  (OOW, 0-30) and use of medications to treat opioid withdrawal. Of 32 patients in  the NB group, 59% experienced clinically relevant withdrawal (defined as OOW > or  = 5) on day 2, but, after day 5, none experienced withdrawal. In the PB group,  the number of patients experiencing withdrawal increased over time. The first  naltrexone dose induced comparable withdrawal in both groups: peak OOW scores  were (mean +/- SD) 5.2 +/- 3.3 on day 2 for the NB group, and 4.0 +/- 3.9 on day  8 for the PB group (NS), though, on day 2, 7 patients dropped out in the NB group  and none in the PB group, while only one patient dropped out in the PB group on  day 8. Throughout the 8-day study, patients in both groups received similar  amount of adjunct medication: 0.64 +/- 0.07 mg (NB group) of clonidine vs 0.73  +/- 0.15 mg (PB group; NS). Only 25% of patients required use of sedatives (up to  20 mg diazepam). Starting naltrexone on day 2 appeared to abolish withdrawal  symptoms after day 5 and, thus, to shorten the duration of withdrawal symptoms.  Peak withdrawal symptoms after naltrexone were of moderate intensity, suggesting  that naltrexone combined with buprenorphine is an acceptable and safe treatment  for shortened opioid detoxification and induction of naltrexone maintenance.","1999-10-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:57:13","","181-190","","3","56","","Drug Alcohol Depend","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Umbricht1999a PMID: 10529020 place: Ireland","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Double-Blind Method; Drug Interactions; Area Under Curve; Drug Therapy, Combination; Analgesics/therapeutic use; Narcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use; Clonidine/therapeutic use; Heroin Dependence/*rehabilitation; Buprenorphine/*therapeutic use; Heroin/*adverse effects; Naltrexone/*therapeutic use; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats that had intravenously self-administrated heroin for  5 consecutive daily sessions of 6 h, and were decapitated immediately after the  last session, showed a decreased concentration of beta E-IR in the anterior lobe  (AL) of the pituitary while rats that had taken cocaine showed a decreased  concentration of beta E-IR in the septum. Rats that had self-administrated heroin  or cocaine and were decapitated 18 h after the last session, showed an increased  concentration of beta E-IR in plasma and decreased concentrations in the AL of  the pituitary and in specific areas of the brain limbic system, i.e. nucleus  accumbens, septum, hippocampus and rostral striatum. The finding that  self-administration of both the opiate heroin, inducing psychic and physical  dependence, and the non-opiate cocaine, inducing psychic but not physical  dependence, is accompanied by similar changes in beta E-IR concentrations  particularly in limbic brain structures, and that these effects are present 18 h  but not immediately after the last session, suggests that beta E and related  peptides in limbic brain regions may represent a neurochemical correlate for  psychic dependence on drugs.","1989","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1133-1140","","16","44","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 2523016","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Tissue Distribution; Brain/metabolism; Radioimmunoassay; Osmolar Concentration; *Cocaine; *Heroin; Limbic System/*metabolism; beta-Endorphin/blood/*metabolism; Substance-Related Disorders/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nalbuphine is only available in  injectable form due to low oral bioavailability. Nasal nalbuphine spray provides  advantages in drug safety, avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism, is non-invasive  and is convenient for patient-controlled analgesia by self-administration. This  study aimed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the newly  developed nalbuphine nasal spray in comparison with a solution for injections.  METHODS: Twenty-four healthy Caucasian volunteers were enrolled in this  randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Subjects were administered one of the  drugs: nasal spray 7.0 mg/dose, nalbuphine hydrochloride solution for injection  10 mg/dose intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). High-performance liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine nalbuphine  concentrations. RESULTS: A comparison of PK profiles for IV, IM and intranasal  (IN) routes of nalbuphine administration revealed a close similarity of  absorption phases for nasal spray and IM injection. Differences between the mean  T(max) and dose-adjusted C(max) values for nasal spray and IM injection were  statistically insignificant. The median values of the elimination rate constants  and the terminal elimination half-life following IV, IM and IN nalbuphine  administration were similar. The mean absolute bioavailability of the nasal spray  equalled 65.04%. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity of PK parameters of IM-injected  nalbuphine solution and the nasal spray allows us to assume the latter is a  feasible alternative to intramuscular nalbuphine injections appropriate for  self-administration and field environments for managing moderate and severe pain  of various aetiologies.","2023-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","3311-3323","","11","89","","Br J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 British Pharmacological Society.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37328144","","","","Humans; pharmacokinetics; Cross-Over Studies; Healthy Volunteers; Biological Availability; bioavailability; Analgesics, Opioid; drug delivery; Nasal Sprays; *Nalbuphine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; nalbuphine nasal spray; nasal absorption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All opioids are weak bases with different lipid  solubilities; the octanol-water partition coefficient varies from 1.4 to 1700 for  morphine and sufentanil, respectively. Lipid solubility is an essential factor  for diffusion capacity across the capillary walls but the rate at which drug  enters the brain by simple passive diffusion is more related to the diffusible  fraction (unbound, unionized) for fentanyl and its derivatives. The relative  potency of the analgesic effect is related to the characteristics of the opiate  receptor interaction (KD, Ki). Sufentanil is the most potent of the opioids  currently available for use in man, it has a very high binding affinity for the  mu-opioid receptor. The duration of the pharmacological effect is determined by  the time of dissociation of stereospecific drug-receptor binding and also by  pharmacokinetic half-life; the recovery would be expected in consideration of the  different terminal half-times.","1991","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","318-320","","6-7","32","","Agressologie","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 1688220","","","","Humans; Half-Life; Central Nervous System/*metabolism; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, dose ratio escalation  study. SETTING: Single center. PARTICIPANTS: Following conversion to a stable IV  dose of hydromorphone, 12 non-treatment-seeking, opioid-dependent subjects were  randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug; seven subjects  received all five study treatments. Five subjects withdrew early from the  treatment phase: adverse events (2) and participant decision (3). INTERVENTIONS:  Participants underwent a dose-selection phase to stabilize on an individualized  hydromorphone dose. Stable subjects were dosed intravenously on 5 consecutive  days. The dose received was one of five hydromorphone/naloxone dose ratios that  included the combination of hydromorphone and placebo naloxone.  Hydromorphone/naloxone treatment always involved increasing dose ratios of  naloxone (8:1, 6:1, 4:1, and 2:1) with the hydromorphone-placebo naloxone  treatment randomly assigned within the sequence of dose ratios. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: Drug Liking visual analog scale (VAS), Objective Opioid Withdrawal  Scale (OOWS) and Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS). RESULTS:  Hydromorphone/naloxone placebo produced subjective effects typical of opioid  administration, while hydromorphone/naloxone dose ratios were associated with  significant increases in SOWS and OOWS scores (p < 0.05). Compared with  hydromoprophone/naloxone placebo, naloxone reduced the effects of hydromorphone  on most measures, including Drug Liking VAS, the antagonism was greatest for the  4:1 and 2:1 ratios. CONCLUSIONS: This study was an ethical investigation of the  abuse deterrence potential of four hydromorphone/naloxone dose ratios. The IV  coadministration of commercially available IV solutions of hydromorphone and  naloxone in 4:1 and 2:1 ratios had statistically greater reductions of  abuse-related opioid effects and triggers of withdrawal symptoms and there was a  convergence of subjective and objective pharmacodynamic results and safety  findings. An oral modified-release product, developed with a 2:1  hydromorphone/naloxone ratio, may have important public health benefits by  reducing high-risk, IV abuse of prescription opioids, while providing pain relief  when ingested orally and used in accordance with the Product Monograph.","2016-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","165-180","","3","12","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27435437","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Injections, Intravenous; Cross-Over Studies; Young Adult; Drug Therapy, Combination; Opioid-Related Disorders/*prevention & control; *Abuse-Deterrent Formulations; Hydromorphone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Naloxone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oxycodone is an opium alkaloid used in  long-term pain management therapy. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used for the  treatment of seizures and panic disorders. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN)  has reported an increase of 108% in the last two years of emergency department  episodes related to Oxycontin. Six billion prescriptions were written for  Oxycontin in the year 2000, an 18-fold increase from four years previous (1).  Oxycontin has recently gained enormous notoriety at the local and national  levels; however, there are very few previously documented cases of lethal drug  interactions between oxycodone and clonazepam. Synergistic effects between these  two drugs are postulated to arise from different agonistic mechanisms producing  similar physiological changes. It is also theorized that clonazepam may inhibit  the metabolism of oxycodone. A 38-year-old white female was found dead in  Jefferson County, Tennessee in March of 2001. The deceased had physical evidence  of previous drug abuse and positive serological findings of hepatitis B and C.  Prescription pill bottles filled under the name of the deceased, as well as  another name, were found with the body. Serum, urine and gastric contents from  the deceased were screened for numerous drugs and metabolites using a combination  of thin layer chromatography and immunoassay techniques (EMIT and FPIA). Analysis  of biological specimens from the deceased revealed the presence of:  benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), and trazodone metabolites in the serum;  cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), trazodone, trazodone  metabolites, nicotine, and nicotine metabolite in the urine; and benzodiazepines,  opiates (oxycodone), nicotine, and nicotine metabolite in the gastric contents.  Quantitative analyses for clonazepam was performed by high performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC) and revealed a plasma concentration of 1.41 microg/mL.  Plasma oxycodone and urine 11-nor-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol  concentrations were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and  revealed concentrations of 0.60 microg/mL and 27.9 ng/mL, respectively. The  deceased had pathologies consistent with severe central nervous system (CNS) and  respiratory depression produced by high concentrations of clonazepam and  oxycodone including collapsed lungs, aspirated mucus, and heart failure. The  pathologies were sufficient to cause death, which was officially attributed to a  drug overdose; however, the manner of death was unknown.","2003-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","683-686","","3","48","","J Forensic Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12762549","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Fatal Outcome; Analgesics, Opioid/analysis/pharmacokinetics/*poisoning; Anticonvulsants/analysis/pharmacokinetics/*poisoning; Clonazepam/analysis/pharmacokinetics/*poisoning; Oxycodone/analysis/pharmacokinetics/*poisoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care","","0195-4210","","","This paper addresses the problem of estimating the depth of anesthesia in clinical practice where many drugs are used in combination. The aim of the  project is to use pharmacokinetically-derived data to predict episodes of light  anesthesia. The weighted linear combination of anesthetic drug concentrations was  computed using a stochastic pharmacokinetic model. The clinical definition of  light anesthesia was based on the hemodynamic consequences of autonomic nervous  system responses to surgical stimuli. A rule-based expert system was used to  review anesthesia records to determine instances of light anesthesia using  hemodynamic criteria. It was assumed that light anesthesia was a direct  consequence of the weighted linear combination of drug concentrations in the  patient's body that decreased below a certain threshold. We augmented traditional  two-compartment models with a stochastic component of anesthetics' concentrations  to compensate for interpatient pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. A  cohort of 532 clinical anesthesia cases was examined and parameters of two  compartment pharmacokinetic models for 6 intravenously administered anesthetic  drugs (fentanyl, thiopenthal, morphine, propofol, midazolam, ketamine) were  estimated, as well as the parameters for 2 inhalational anesthetics (N2O and  isoflurane). These parameters were then prospectively applied to 22 cases that  were not used for parameter estimation, and the predictive ability of the  pharmacokinetic model was determined. The goal of the study is the development of  a pharmacokinetic model that will be useful in predicting light anesthesia in the  clinically relevant circumstance where many drugs are used concurrently.","1995","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","47-51","","","","","Proc Annu Symp Comput Appl Med Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8563327  PMCID: PMC2579053","","","","Humans; Stochastic Processes; *Models, Biological; *Expert Systems; *Computer Simulation; Anesthetics, Intravenous/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Anesthetics, Inhalation/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A reappraisal of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use in pain management.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199753010-00012","","Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with strong analgesic activity. The analgesic efficacy of ketorolac has been extensively evaluated in  the postoperative setting, in both hospital inpatients and outpatients, and in  patients with various other acute pain states. After major abdominal, orthopaedic  or gynaecological surgery or ambulatory laparoscopic or gynaecological  procedures, ketorolac provides relief from mild to severe pain in the majority of  patients and has similar analgesic efficacy to that of standard dosages of  morphine and pethidine (meperidine) as well as less frequently used opioids and  other NSAIDs. The analgesic effect of ketorolac may be slightly delayed but often  persists for longer than that of opioids. Combined therapy with ketorolac and an  opioid results in a 25 to 50% reduction in opioid requirements, and in some  patients this is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in opioid-induced adverse  events, more rapid return to normal gastrointestinal function and shorter stay in  hospital. In children undergoing myringotomy, hernia repair, tonsillectomy, or  other surgery associated with mild to moderate pain, ketorolac provides  comparable analgesia to morphine, pethidine or paracetamol (acetaminophen). In  the emergency department, ketorolac attenuates moderate to severe pain in  patients with renal colic, migraine headache, musculoskeletal pain or sickle cell  crisis and is usually as effective as frequently used opioids, such as morphine  and pethidine, and other NSAIDs and analgesics. Subcutaneous administration of  ketorolac reduces pain in patients with cancer and seems particularly beneficial  in pain resulting from bone metastases. The acquisition cost of ketorolac is  greater than that of morphine or pethidine; however, in a small number of  studies, the higher cost of ketorolac was offset when treatment with ketorolac  resulted in a reduced hospital stay compared with alternative opioid therapy. The  tolerability profile of ketorolac parallels that of other NSAIDs; most clinically  important adverse events affect the gastrointestinal tract and/or renal or  haematological function. The incidence of serious or fatal adverse events  reported with ketorolac has decreased since revision of dosage guidelines.  Results from a large retrospective postmarketing surveillance study in more than  20,000 patients demonstrated that the overall risk of gastrointestinal or  operative site bleeding related to parenteral ketorolac therapy was only slightly  higher than with opioids. However, the risk increased markedly when high dosages  were used for more than 5 days, especially in the elderly. Acute renal failure  may occur after treatment with ketorolac but is usually reversible on drug  discontinuation. In common with other NSAIDs, ketorolac has also been implicated  in allergic or hypersensitivity reactions. In summary, ketorolac is a strong  analgesic with a tolerability profile which resembles that of other NSAIDs. When  used in accordance with current dosage guidelines, this drug provides a useful  alternative, or adjuvant, to opioids in patients with moderate to severe pain.","1997-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","139-188","","1","53","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 9010653","","","","Humans; Pain/*drug therapy; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*therapeutic use; Ketorolac; Tolmetin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scientific edition","","0167-6555","10.1007/BF01962707","","The metabolism of 2-n-propyl-2-pentenoate (delta 2-VPA) was evaluated in human hepatic microsomal fractions. Two biotransformation pathways have been  particularly investigated. In the presence of the cytochrome P-450 co-factor,  NADPH, the main metabolites recovered were delta 3-VPA, delta 2,4-VPA and VPA.  The glucuronidation of delta 2-VPA was also studied on various hepatic microsomal  fractions using Brij 35 as activator and UDP-glucuronic acid as co-factor. A  large interindividual variability occurred in this metabolic pathway. Km and Vmax  were 0.85 mmol/l and 1.75 nmol.min-1.mg-1, respectively, for delta 2-VPA and 1.11  mmol/l and 5.71 nmol.min-1.mg-1 for VPA, respectively. The good correlation (r =  0.82; p less than 0.001) observed between the glucuronidation of VPA and delta  2-VPA as well as the mutual inhibition of each other's glucuronidation strongly  suggests that (a) common single UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzyme(s) was  (were) involved in this glucuronidation step. The glucuronidation of specific  substrates for various UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes showed a good  relationship between the glucuronidations of delta 2-VPA and morphine, a  substrate for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B. Moreover, morphine competitively  inhibits delta 2-VPA glucuronidation. It seems the same isoenzyme or, at least,  (a) very closely related isoenzyme(s) belonging to UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2  isoenzyme, is involved in delta 2-VPA glucuronidation.","1992-06-19","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","146-151","","3A","14","","Pharm Weekbl Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 1502016","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Biotransformation; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism; Oxygenases/metabolism; Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/*pharmacokinetics; Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism; Anticonvulsants/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effect of chronic drug exposure on the distribution, metabolism and excretion in the rat].","Der Anaesthesist","","0003-2417","","","In male Wistar rats, tissue distribution and excretion of fentanyl and its metabolites were studied after intravenous of intramuscular injection. Oxidative  desalkylation leading to phenylacetic acid and norfentanyl proved to be the main  degradation pathway in-vivo, whereas other metabolites, including the  pharmacologically still active p-hydroxy(phenethyl)fentanyl were formed only in  minor quantities. All compounds could be detected in any tissue under study  (brain, lung, liver, kidney, muscle and fat) as well as in the gastric contents,  the amount of fentanyl in the latter cumulating to about 2% of the total dose 60  min after injection, compared with about 10% in the fat. In rats chronically  treated with ethanol, nicotine, morphine, phenobarbital, promethazine or  diazepam, major differences in in-vitro fentanyl metabolism by liver homogenates  were observed including both inhibition and induction. Phenobarbital pretreatment  also induced extrahepatic biotransformation in kidney, adrenals and intestinal  mucosa. On the other hand, tissue concentrations of fentanyl and its metabolites  did not clearly reflect the in-vitro changes in metabolic activity. Fentanyl  brain levels were found to be lower in the treatment groups but seemed not to  correlate with pharmacodynamics, less effects following injection being observed  only after ethanol and morphine. The in-vitro metabolic drug interaction proved  to be of less importance than changes in diuresis and/or urinary pH when  excretion products were analysed. As a conclusion, it is suggested that altered  sensitivity of brain tissue rather than changes in bioavailability must explain  variations in dose-response relationship which are frequently believed to be seen  when fentanyl is used in patients with chronic drug administration.","1983-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","165-173","","4","32","","Anaesthesist","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 6881518","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Biotransformation; Tissue Distribution; Dealkylation; Ethanol/pharmacology; Nicotine/pharmacology; Diazepam/pharmacology; Central Nervous System Depressants/pharmacology; Fentanyl/administration & dosage/*metabolism; Promethazine/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined whether perinatal cimetidine exposure altered the  androgen 'imprinting' of sex differences in mature male hepatic biotransformation  capacities. During the perinatal period, dams were infused with cimetidine (18  mg/kg/day) through Alzet osmotic pumps placed subcutaneously beginning at 10 days  of gestation. Pump function was confirmed by weekly high-performance liquid  chromatographic analysis of maternal urine for unchanged cimetidine. Male pups  were culled at birth with continued exposure to cimetidine in breast milk until  weaning. At about 100 days of age, in vitro and in vivo drug oxidative and  conjugative activities were measured in mature males. Early cimetidine exposure  did not alter hepatic oxidative (cytochrome P-450 content or monooxygenase  activity) or conjugative (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity towards  testosterone, morphine, 1-naphthol, estrone, or sulfotransferase activity towards  acetaminophen or glycolithocholate) capacities in mature males. Two  sulfotransferase isoenzyme activities (acetaminophen sulfotransferase 2 and bile  salt sulfotransferase I) previously shown to be regulated by gonadal hormones  were also unchanged. Serum testosterone was unaffected by perinatal cimetidine  exposure. Moreover, there were no effects of perinatal cimetidine exposure on in  vivo pharmacokinetics or metabolic fate of acetaminophen. CONCLUSION: Perinatal  exposure of male pups to doses of cimetidine similar to those used in humans did  not appear to affect the imprinting of sex differences on in vitro hepatic drug  metabolism or elimination kinetics of acetaminophen.","1989","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","96-105","","2","12","","Dev Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2714162","","","","Male; Female; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Biotransformation; Liver/*metabolism; Pregnancy; Acetaminophen/pharmacokinetics; Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Cimetidine/*adverse effects; Arylsulfotransferase/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 52-year-old woman suffered from  long-standing ""generalized dystonia"", which had become resistant to conventional  therapy. Therefore, an anesthetist established a permanent medication scheme with  pancuronium using a PCA pump. This pump had been controlled by the patient  herself ensuring an acceptable quality of life with broad personal autonomy.  Finally, the woman was found dead in her flat by a member of a home nursing  service. The infusion hose showed a fixed knot and further blocking by a clamp.  The autopsy findings were non-specific, except for the presence of opioid tablets  in the colon. Toxicological analyses showed 72ng/ml pancuronium and 21 ng/ml  oxycodone (therapeutic) in the femoral venous blood. The range of published  pancuronium levels varies from approx. 80 to 2,000 ng/ml. Thus it had to be  assumed that the pancuronium level was too low (72 ng/ml) so that symptoms of  dystonia recurred. Based on extensive literature research, the described case can  be qualified as unique. The therapy concept had been innovative, sufficient and  effective for more than 10 years. It allowed the patient to enjoy a maximum of  autonomy. Ultimately, death was due to the blocked pancuronium infusion. The  relatively low pancuronium level had provoked the dystonia to return with  generalized spasms also involving the respiratory muscles resulting in  respiratory arrest.

Therefore, these metabolites are often not taken into account in  evaluating drug effects. The present review describes examples of both direct and  indirect contributions of glucuronides to net drug effects. Multiple lines of  evidence indicate that morphine-6-glucuronide has analgesic activity. This  compound has a high affinity to the mu-receptor, is capable of penetrating the  blood/brain barrier and is a potent analgesic after administration to patients.  Indirect activity of glucuronides may consist of a systemic cycle in which an  active parent compound is derived from the glucuronide by enzymatic action. Such  systemic cycling has been demonstrated for clofibric acid. In addition, some acyl  glucuronides are subject to intramolecular rearrangement and the resulting  metabolites are resistant to beta-glucuronidase. Covalent protein binding of  glucuronides by different mechanisms may contribute to drug toxicity and immune  responses. If glucuronides are accepted as potential modifiers of net drug action  it is important to determine what factors modulate disposition of these  compounds. Therefore, the later section of this review describes glucuronidation  under different pathophysiological conditions. Examples for alterations of the  rate and/or extent of glucuronidation by concurrent diseases processes, age and  coadministration of other drugs are provided.","1992-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","292-310","","4","23","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 1395362","","","","Humans; Age Factors; *Pharmacokinetics; Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism; Glucuronates/blood/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: An open-label study with a  dose-titration period (up to 45 days) and a maintenance period (12 months).  PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: A total of 922 patients with chronic nonmalignant and  non-neuropathic moderate to severe pain received open-label HYD tablets 20-120  mg; 728 of these achieved a stabilized dose of HYD at the end of dose-titration  and entered the maintenance period. RESULTS: The safety profile was similar to  that of other oral opioid analgesics, without new or unexpected safety concerns.  The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs; ≥ 5 percent) were those  commonly associated with the use of systemic µ-opioid analgesics, including  nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, somnolence, and headache.  There were 77 (8 percent) patients with a total of 109 nonfatal  treatment-emergent serious AEs. Few patients discontinued due to lack of  therapeutic effect overall (6 percent), especially during the 12-month  maintenance period (4 percent). Pain relief, sleep, functional health, and  activities of daily living all improved at the end of the dose-titration period  with HYD. These improvements were maintained through the 12-month maintenance  period with stable HYD doses and without increase in concomitant supplemental  analgesic medications. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study demonstrated the safety  and long-term maintenance of analgesic effect of HYD without continued need for  dose increase.","2015-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","339-356","","4","11","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26312961","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Administration, Oral; Treatment Outcome; Drug Administration Schedule; United States; Activities of Daily Living; Longitudinal Studies; Delayed-Action Preparations; Pain Measurement; Severity of Illness Index; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Pain Management/methods; Opioid-Related Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control; *Chronic Pain/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology; *Hydrocodone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blood concentrations of alcohol and drugs  of abuse, especially tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and  morphine, may already have dropped significantly after a delay of only half an  hour. These delays are typically due to the time elapsing until the order to take  a blood sample has been obtained from a judge and a medical doctor becomes  available and arrives at the police station to draw a blood sample.

Recommendations regarding opioid use in patients with CKD are  based on pharmacokinetic data, extrapolation from non-CKD studies, and from  clinical experience. Given the potential increased risk for opioid-related  adverse events in patients with reduced kidney function, health care providers  may be hesitant to prescribe opioids, resulting in inadequate pain control. This  review summarizes current studies of opioid use in patients with CKD, highlights  special considerations, and proposes an opioid prescribing strategy for this  unique patient population. Specifically, oral hydromorphone, transdermal  fentanyl, and buprenorphine should be considered as the first-line opioids for  patients with CKD if opioid management is indicated. A stepwise approach such as  the Screen-Quantify-Use opioids-Adjust-Reassess-Engage prescribing strategy  proposed here is critical to ensure optimal pain control while minimizing the  side effects and adverse events of opioids. The effects of opioids on clinically  relevant outcomes in the CKD population remains to be explored in future studies.","2021-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:39:37","","33-41","","1","41","","Semin Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

After pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, we  constructed utility functions to combine the wanted and unwanted end points into  a single function. We hypothesized that the function would be predominantly  negative over the tested oxycodone concentration range. Twenty-four male and  female volunteers received 20 (n = 12) or 40 (n = 12) mg oral oxycodone  immediate-release tablets. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses (visit 1) or  responses to 3 nociceptive assays (pain pressure, electrical, and thermal tests;  visit 2) were measured at regular intervals for 7 hours. the PK/PD analyses, that  included carbon dioxide kinetics, stood at the basis of the utility function:  probability of antinociception minus probability of respiratory depression.  Oxycodone had rapid onset/offset times (30-40 minutes) with potency values  (effect-site concentration causing 50% of effect) ranging from 0.05 to 0.13 ng/mL  for respiratory variables obtained at hypercapnia and antinociceptive responses.  Ventilation at an extrapolated end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure of  55 mmHg, was used for creation of 3 utility functions, one for each of the  nociceptive tests. Contrary to expectation, the utility functions were close to  zero or positive over the clinical oxycodone concentration range. The similar or  better likelihood for antinociception relative to respiratory depression may be  related to oxycodone's receptor activation profile or to is high likeability that  possibly alters the modulation of nociceptive input. Oxycodone differs from other  μ-opioids, such as fentanyl, that have a consistent negative utility.","2023-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1080-1088","","5","113","","Clin Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

The use of the opiate alkaloids is accompanied by several  unwanted side effects; additionally, some forms of pain are resistant to standard  treatments (e.g. neuropathic pain from cancer). For these reasons, there is  currently renewed interest in the design and assay of modified versions of the  potent endogenous opioid peptides endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2.

PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-six  healthy volunteers were randomized to receive 80, 160, or 240 mg of daily  OxyContin to steady state while under a naltrexone blockade. During days 3 and 4  of the study, urine samples of all participants were collected, and oxycodone  levels detected in the urine were obtained using a liquid chromatography-mass  spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) assay. OUTCOME MEASURES: The concordance was calculated  for raw and adjusted LC-MS-MS urine oxycodone values within each study  participant between their third and fourth day values. Also, an analysis of  medians was calculated for each of the dosage groupings using Bonett-Price  confidence intervals for both raw and adjusted LC-MS-MS values. RESULTS: The  concordance correlation coefficient for the raw LC-MS-MS values between days 3  and 4 was 0.689 (95% confidence intervals = 0.515, 0.864), whereas the  concordance correlation coefficient for the LC-MS-MS values using the algorithm  (ie, normalized values) was 0.882 (95% confidence intervals = 0.808, 0.956).  Because of greater variability in the raw values, some overlap was observed in  the confidence intervals of the various OxyContin doses, whereas no overlap was  observed in the normalized confidence intervals regardless of the application of  a Bonferroni adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to raw LC-MS-MS values, an  algorithm that normalizes oxycodone urine drug levels for pH, specific gravity,  and lean body mass discriminates well among all three of the daily doses of  OxyContin tested (80, 160, and 240 mg), even with correcting for multiple  analyses.","2009-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","359-364","","6","5","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20073409","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Chromatography, Liquid; Young Adult; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; *Algorithms; *Medication Adherence; Substance Abuse Detection/*methods; *Urinalysis; Naltrexone/administration & dosage; Narcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*urine; Opioid-Related Disorders/*diagnosis/urine; Oxycodone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

G protein activation was  assessed with [(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding  assays conducted at both 37 and 0 degrees C. Ligand-independent (constitutive)  activity of the delta-receptor was readily observed when the [(35)S]GTP gamma S  binding assay was performed at 37 degrees C. We identified a new class of  alkaloid inverse agonists (RTI-5989-1, RTI-5989-23, RTI-5989-25), which are more  potent than the previously described peptide inverse agonist ICI-174864  (N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu). Treatment with these inverse agonists for 18 h  caused up-regulation of surface receptors. Eighteen-hour treatment with etorphine  resulted in approximately 90% loss of surface receptor, whereas fentanyl,  diprenorphine, and morphine caused between 20 and 50% loss. The abilities of  ligands to modulate [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding at 37 degrees C showed a strong  correlation with their abilities to regulate surface receptor number (r(2) =  0.86). Interestingly, the ability of fentanyl to activate G proteins was markedly  temperature sensitive. Fentanyl showed no stimulation of [(35)S]GTP gamma S  binding at 0 degrees C but was as efficacious as etorphine, morphine, and  diprenorphine at 37 degrees C. Neither the ligand-induced receptor increases nor  decreases were perturbed by pertussis toxin pretreatment, suggesting that  functional G proteins are not required for ligand-regulated delta-opioid receptor  trafficking.","2001-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1015-1020","","3","298","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11504798","","","","Cell Line; Ligands; Flow Cytometry; Biotransformation/physiology; Signal Transduction/drug effects; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Pertussis Toxin; Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology; Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology; GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism; Enkephalin, Leucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, delta/*agonists/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concomitant administration of minute doses (about 0.5 mcg) of the  opioid antagonist naltrexone with each dose of codeine was found in both cases to  obviate the expected opioid withdrawal syndrome, resulting in asymptomatic and  uneventful transitions from physical opioid dependency states to exogenous  opioid-free metabolism. These experiments are analyzed in the context of a  conjectured, rapid, iterative reduction and complete elimination of opioid  tolerance, once acquired. It was found that coadministration of naltrexone with  codeine phosphate obviated the development of both tolerance and physical  dependency over several months of four daily oral doses of 200 mg, allowing  abrupt (""cold turkey""), asymptomatic and uneventful withdrawal. This points the  way to the biochemical substrate of opioid tolerance itself, and shows that this  can easily and inexpensively be blocked, even over months of iterative oral  administration of substantial doses of opioid analgesics. Finally, it suggests  the opioid withdrawal syndrome is directly related to the physiology of opioid  tolerance, and can be prevented by blocking tolerance itself. Even when tolerance  has been acquired, this can be reduced stepwise over a matter of days, with no  symptoms of opioid withdrawal syndrome.","2006-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","101-105","","1","38","","J Psychoactive Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16681181","","","","Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Half-Life; Treatment Outcome; Opioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy; Narcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use; *Codeine; Naltrexone/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study  is to design and interface a macromolecular nanodrug system to deliver rifampin  (RIF) and methadone (MTD) simultaneously to the liver based on magnetic  nanoparticles (MNPs). RIF increases the metabolism of MTD in the liver. In this  study, MTD was linked to a magnetic nanocapsule including RIF by a heterocyclic  linker. This heterocyclic linker was prepared in five steps. Fourier transform  infrared spectroscopy and NMR indicated the synthesis of the heterocyclic linker,  scanning electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy exhibited the  morphology of NPs and loading MTD. Atomic force microscopy was applied to  indicate the three-dimensional topology of NPs and the conglomeration on them.  Magnetization properties of loaded and unloaded NPs were characterized by  vibrating-sample magnetometer. These patterns indicated superparamagnetic  properties of MNPs therefore these NPs do not retain any magnetism after removal  of a magnetic field. In vitro release studies of RIF and MTD by UV-vis  measurements in several buffer solutions demonstrated that behavior of drug  release is related to pH. The histopathology study was performed on the liver of  rats injected with MTD, morphine (MOR), and the prepared drug. Cytotoxicity of  the prepared sample on MCF-7 cell line assay was assessed via 3-[4,  5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution. The  histopathology study indicated that the cotreatment of the synthesized drug  attenuated hepatic lesions.

These studies were undertaken to improve on the limited knowledge of  glucuronidation by the dog and to assess its suitability as a model species for  pharmacokinetic studies. In general, the compounds studied were glucuronidated  severalfold more rapidly (based on intrinsic clearance estimates) by DLM than by  HLM. Intrinsic clearance values for human UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 substrates were an  order of magnitude higher in DLM than in HLM (e.g., gemfibrozil: 31 microl/min/mg  versus 3.0 microl/min/mg; ketoprofen: 2.4 microl/min/mg versus 0.2  microl/min/mg). There were also drug-specific differences. HLM readily  glucuronidated propofol (2.4 microl/min/mg) whereas DLM appeared unable to  glucuronidate this drug directly. Regioselective differences in morphine  glucuronidation were also apparent. Human kidney microsomes catalyzed the  glucuronidation of many xenobiotics, although glucuronidation of the endobiotic  bilirubin was not detectable in this tissue.

Extensive, repetitive work-up excluded small bowel, liver, and pancreatic disease  and drug interactions.

Supervised absorption tests of  several LT(4) preparations in increasing dosages (250-1500 microg/d) confirmed an  insufficient rise in serum T(4) levels following oral drug administration. Thus,  intravenous LT(4) application (5 times per week) was commenced to restore at  least normal range TSH levels. Repetition of absorption tests 1 year later, after  a documented period of more than 3 months of stable euthyroidism, showed a  considerable improvement of intestinal LT(4) uptake. Subsequently, the patient  was managed on large doses of oral LT(4) (1500-2100 microg/d) alone, but this was  found to be insufficient so that continuous intravenous LT(4) was administered  via a morphine pump device to ultimately achieve stable euthyroidism. Of note, at  4-year follow-up there was no evidence of recurrent or metastasized papillary  thyroid cancer. The reason for the disturbed intestinal LT(4) absorption in this  patient remains unresolved. However, we would like to suggest the possibility of  a specific intestinal uptake deficit, which will only become apparent in the case  of previous thyroid ablation.","2006-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:59:00","","1047-1051","","10","16","","Thyroid","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Tonjes2006a PMID: 17042692 place: United States","","","","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Administration, Oral; *Intestinal Absorption; Thyroidectomy; Carcinoma, Papillary/*surgery; Hypothyroidism/*drug therapy; Thyroid Neoplasms/*surgery; Thyroxine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quantitative determination of drugs and metabolites, other  than ethanol, shows wide interlaboratory variation. This variation is presumably  not a result of the use of different analytical techniques, since gas liquid  chromatography was used by the majority of participants to quantitate drugs and  metabolites.

Ketorolac exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic  activity. Although the exact mechanisms of action have not been determined, its  effects appear to be associated principally with the inhibition of prostaglandin  synthesis. After oral, i.m., or i.v. administration, ketorolac and its  metabolites are excreted mainly in urine. Ketorolac tromethamine has been used  for the symptomatic relief of moderate to severe postoperative pain, including  that associated with abdominal, gynecologic, oral, orthopedic, or urologic  surgery. Ketorolac has also been used for the relief of acute renal colic, pain  associated with trauma, and visceral pain associated with cancer. When  administered i.m., ketorolac produced analgesia comparable to that of i.m. doses  of meperidine, pentazocine, or morphine. The most common adverse effects  associated with short-term administration are nervous system and gastrointestinal  effects; these are usually mild and occur in about 39% of patients. Unlike opiate  analgesics, ketorolac does not appear to cause tolerance or physical dependence  in patients receiving long-term therapy. Ketorolac tromethamine has been  administered concomitantly with morphine or meperidine without apparent adverse  interaction. For short-term pain management, an initial i.m. ketorolac  tromethamine loading dose of 30 or 60 mg is recommended. Ketorolac tromethamine  appears to be as effective as morphine or meperidine for short-term management of  moderate to severe postoperative pain.

DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: Data  from journal articles and other sources describing the pharmacology and safety of  over-the-counter cough suppressants and expectorants, drug-drug interactions with  immunosuppressive agents, and drug-disease state interactions are reviewed. DATA  SYNTHESIS: Potential and documented drug-drug interactions between  immunosuppressive agents and over-the-counter cough medications guaifenesin,  dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, and codeine were evaluated on the basis of  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Interactions between these cough  medications and the physiological changes in the body following transplantation  also were examined. CONCLUSION: Diphenhydramine requires additional monitoring  when used to treat cough in transplant recipients owing to its anticholinergic  properties and the potential for interactions with cyclosporine. Dextromethorphan  can be used in most transplant recipients, although greater caution should be  exercised if the patient has undergone liver transplant or has liver impairment.  Guaifenesin can be used in transplant recipients but should be used with caution  in patients receiving kidney or lung transplants and in patients with renal  impairment. Codeine combined with guaifenesin is another option for cough and can  be used in most transplant patients although those with reduced renal function  should be monitored carefully for adverse events.","2011-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","6-13; quiz 14","","1","21","","Prog Transplant","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21485938","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Drug Monitoring; Safety; *Organ Transplantation; Contraindications; Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects; Drug Utilization; Antitussive Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Codeine/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Dextromethorphan/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Diphenhydramine/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Expectorants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Guaifenesin/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Nonprescription Drugs/*adverse effects/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The glucuronide of AZT was preliminarily identified  through hydrolysis by beta-D-glucuronidase. Brij 58 was shown to be the best  activator of AZT glucuronidation by human liver microsomes, as it increased the  rate of glucuronide formation 3-fold. The UDPGT activities toward AZT measured in  29 different microsomal fractions was slightly variable among samples (79 to 268  nmol/hr/mg protein). The apparent KM value for AZT glucuronidation was about 5  mM. We sought to determine if various known UDPGT activities (i.e. p-nitrophenol  UDPGT, 4-hydroxybiphenyl UDPGT, and DT1-UDPGT) in 18 microsomal samples were  correlated with AZT-UDPGT activity. Experiments revealed that only  4-hydroxybiphenyl UDPGT activity was strongly correlated (r = 0.815, p less than  0.001) with AZT-UDPGT activity, whereas no correlation was found for the other  UDPGT activities. To determine the isozyme conceivably involved in AZT  glucuronidation, we studied the effect of various compounds on AZT  glucuronidation. AZT glucuronidation was inhibited by numerous substrates of the  UDPGT2, form: morphine (Ki = 1.8 mM), 4-hydroxybiphenyl (Ki = 0.92 mM), and  ketoprofen (Ki = 0.75 mM), but also oxazepam, codeine, and chloramphenicol.  p-Nitrophenol appeared to be an inhibitor, whereas acetaminophen had no effect.  Bilirubin, aspirin, cimetidine, and acyclovir did not inhibit AZT  glucuronidation.

The present study was  designed to investigate the generality of this finding across dose, time and type  of opioid agonist. In adult female and male Sprague-Dawley rats, time-effect  curves were obtained for vehicle and three doses each of the mu agonists fentanyl  and buprenorphine, the kappa agonists  (5alpha,7alpha,8alpha)-(-)-N-methyl-[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl  )-1-oxaspiro-(4,5)dec-8-yl]benzeneacetamide (U69,593) and bremazocine and the  delta agonists [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and deltorphin on the 52 degrees  C hot-plate and tail-withdrawal (immersion) assays. There were sex differences in  the antinociceptive effects of the two kappa agonists and the two delta agonists,  but the differences were assay-, dose- and/or time-dependent. Peak effects of  U69,593 on tail withdrawal and DPDPE on hot plate tended to occur earlier in  females than in males, and bremazocine produced greater tail-withdrawal  antinociception in females than in males, whereas the highest doses of the two  delta opioids produced greater hot-plate antinociception in males than in  females. These results contrast with several previous reports showing that male  rodents are more sensitive than females to the antinociceptive effects of mu and  kappa (but not delta) opioids. These discrepancies may be caused by the more  comprehensive examination of sex differences across dose and time used in the  present study; sex differences that are dose- or time-dependent may not be  apparent if a single dose or time point is examined. In addition, repeated  testing procedures used in the present study may produce different results than  acute testing procedures would, if female and male rats develop opioid tolerance  at different rates.","1997-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","769-778","","2","282","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9262340","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Area Under Curve; *Sex Factors; Adaptation, Physiological; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Pain/*physiopathology; Receptors, Opioid/*agonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In older adults, opioids such as oxycodone are often  preferred to other analgesics such as tramadol because of a lower risk of  delirium. Different parameters, such as inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450)  2D6 and/or 3A4, can potentially lead to pharmacokinetic variations of oxycodone  representing a risk of adverse drugs effects or lack of drug response. There is a  risk of drug-drug interactions involving CYP450 in older adults due to the high  prevalence of polypharmacy. This study sought to identify patient characteristics  that influence oxycodone administration. A single-center observational study  included 355 patients with a hip fracture hospitalized in a geriatric  postoperative unit. Composite endpoint based on form, duration, and timing to  intake separated patients into three groups: ""no oxycodone"", ""low oxycodone "",  and ""high oxycodone "". CYP450 interactions were studied based on a composite  variable defining the most involved CYP450 pathways between CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.  CYP450 interactions with CYP2D6 pathway involved were associated with the risk of  ""high oxycodone"" [odds ratio adjusted on age and the type of hip fracture (OR*)  4.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-16.83, p = 0.02)], as well as serum  albumin levels (OR* 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, p = 0.01).

In order to determine the elimination time for various  drugs and their metabolites we recruited 52 volunteers in a protected, low-step  detoxification program. Blood samples were taken from each volunteer for the  first 7 days, daily, urine sample for the first 3 weeks, daily. Urine was  analyzed using a fluorescence-polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and gas  chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), serum using GC/MS. The elimination  times of the drugs and/or their metabolites in urine and serum as well as the  tolerance intervals/confidence intervals were determined. Due to the sometimes  extremely high initial concentrations and low cut-off values, a few of the  volunteers had markedly longer elimination times than those described in the  literature. The cut-off values were as follows: barbiturates II (200ng/ml),  cannabinoids (20ng/ml), cocaine metabolites (300ng/ml), opiates (200ng/ml). GC/MS  detected the following maximum elimination times: total morphine in urine up to  270.3h, total morphine and free morphine in serum up to 121.3h,  monoacetylmorphine in urine up to 34.5h,  11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) in urine up to 433.5h,  THC-COOH in serum up to 74.3h, total codeine in urine up to 123h, free codeine in  urine up to 97.5h, total codeine in serum up to 29h, free codeine in serum up to  6.3h, total dihydrocodeine (DHC) in urine up to 314.8h, free DHC in urine up to  273.3h, total and free DHC in serum up to 50.1h.

G.","Clinically relevant differences among the opioid analgesics.","American journal of hospital pharmacy","","0002-9289","","","The mechanism of action of opioids and clinically relevant differences among the opioid analgesics are described. Both endorphins (endogenous morphine-like  substances) and exogenous opioids (opium alkaloids and their derivatives) bind to  opioid receptors in the human central nervous system to provide analgesia and  other effects. Some drugs, such as morphine, are true agonists, i.e., they bind  to and activate receptors. Some are partial agonists, binding to part of the  receptor and causing effects that are similar to, but perhaps less pronounced  than, the effects produced by agonists. Others are antagonist, i.e., they bind to  the receptor but do not cause the associated effects. Some drugs, termed  agonist-antagonist opioids, act as antagonists at one type of receptor and  agonists at another type of receptor. True agonists tend to have relatively  straight-line dose-response curves; in other words, their effect increases with  increasing doses over a broad dosage range. Partial agonists and  agonist-antagonists tend to have ceiling effects; that is, they do not have the  broad dosage range of drugs such as morphine, methadone, hydromorphone, and other  ""strong"" opioids. This fact mediates against the use of partial agonists and  agonist-antagonists in cancer patients who have chronic pain that may increase as  the disease progresses. Three major factors that should be considered when a drug  is selected for clinical use are (1) relative affinities for the different opioid  receptor types, (2) pharmacokinetic characteristics that influence onset and  duration of action, and (3) whether the opioids are strong or weak. For treatment  of cancer pain, drugs with long durations of action are preferable.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1990-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","S7-13","","8 Suppl","47","","Am J Hosp Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2167610","","","","Humans; Narcotics/*therapeutic use; Neoplasms/physiopathology; Pain, Intractable/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Receptors, Opioid/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Delineation of neurobiological substrates mediating the  reinforcing effects of the combination may increase our knowledge of  reinforcement mechanisms and provide useful new information for the development  of pharmacotherapies. Several studies suggest dopaminergic innervations of the  nucleus accumbens (NAc) have a central role in the brain processes underlying  drug reinforcement. The present study was undertaken to determine the  relationship between the self-administration of cocaine/heroin combinations and  NAc extracellular dopamine concentrations ([DA]e) using in vivo microdialysis and  microbore high-pressure liquid chromatography. Rats were assigned randomly to one  of three groups to self-administer i.v. cocaine (125, 250, and 500  micrograms/infusion; n = 5), heroin (4.5, 9, and 18 micrograms/infusion; n = 5),  or cocaine/heroin combinations (125/4.5; 250/9, and 500/18 micrograms/infusion; n  = 4) under a fixed ratio (FR) 10: 20-s time-out schedule of  reinforcement/multicomponent dosing session. After stable rates of responding  were engendered and maintained, microdialysis samples were collected in 10-min  intervals during the self-administration session. Self-administration of  cocaine/heroin combinations produced synergisitic elevations in NAc [DA]e (1000%  baseline) compared with cocaine (400% baseline) and heroin (not significantly  different from baseline levels). Neither the number of infusions nor the  interinfusion intervals was significantly different between the groups across the  self-administration session. Moreover, cocaine concentrations were not  significantly different between the cocaine and cocaine/heroin groups. These  results demonstrate that heroin interacts with cocaine to produce synergistic  elevations in [DA]e, providing a neurochemical basis for understanding the abuse  liability of cocaine/opiate combinations.","1999-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","274-280","","1","288","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9862781","","","","Male; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Rats; Drug Synergism; Rats, Inbred F344; Microdialysis; Self Administration; Behavior, Animal/drug effects; Dopamine/*metabolism; Nucleus Accumbens/*drug effects/metabolism; Euphoria/drug effects; Heroin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Narcotics/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Reinforcement, Psychology; Cocaine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An acute phase consists of a neonatal  abstinence syndrome characterized by increased CNS arousal. The major behavior  symptoms seen in both humans and animals include hyperactivity, disturbed sleep  and increased lability of state. This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting  from 12 weeks hyperactivity, disturbed sleep and increased lability of state.  This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting from 12 weeks to six months in  humans and 20-25 days in rats. Although confirming pharmacokinetic studies are  needed, it is possible that these persistent symptoms result from the slow  clearance of the drug from neonatal tissues. The second phase of the syndrome is  less well-understood but the available clinical evidence suggests that exposure  to heroin, particularly in a pattern of polydrug abuse, can result in impaired  organizational and perceptual abilities, poor self-adjustment and in situations  requiring motor inhibition, heightened activity. Studies of pre-school children  exposed prenatally to methadone, show no effects on intellectual and cognitive  functioning but do reveal heightened activity or energy level, impulsivity, and  brief attention span and persistence. A finding of impaired motor inhibition  while performing a task has been stressed by one worker as an area of particular  vulnerability among these children. A strikingly similar effect, characterized as  an impaired ability to modulate task-oriented motor activity, has been described  for adult rats prenatally exposed to methadone.","1982-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","429-434","","4","4","","Neurobehav Toxicol Teratol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7121694","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Rats; Sleep Stages/drug effects; Pregnancy; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Motor Activity/drug effects; Behavior, Animal/*drug effects; Arousal/drug effects; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/psychology; Methadone/*adverse effects; Heroin/*adverse effects; Child Behavior Disorders/chemically induced; Child Development/*drug effects; Heroin Dependence/complications; Perception/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The merits to use short-acting  beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonists as anesthetic adjuvants could be to reduce  anesthetic and opioid requirements (thus, to avoid its side effects such as  nausea and vomiting), to maintain hemodynamic stability, and to achieve early  recovery from anesthesia. Administration of a sufficient dose of a short-acting  beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, for example by neuraxial route, may  potentially be a new treatment strategy for the perioperative pain, although  further study is necessary to establish its efficacy and toxicity. Short-acting  beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonists will be used as agents for antinociception  in future.","2006-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","849-855","","7","55","","Masui","","","","","","","","jpn","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 16856545","","","","Humans; Animals; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/*pharmacology; Analgesics/*pharmacology; Intubation, Intratracheal; Adjuvants, Anesthesia/*pharmacology; Morpholines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Propanolamines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Urea/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two LiCl containing diets were used. Rats  on the lower strength diet attained brain Li levels of 0.40-0.55 mEq/L, while  those on the higher strength diet attained levels of 0.70-1.0 mEq/L. In one  series of experiments, we sought to relate alterations of K+-stimulated,  Ca++-dependent release of 1-enk-IR to alterations of the content of the peptide.  After 1 week on the lower strength diet, neither measure was affected in any of  the brain regions examined. Following 2 or 3 weeks of feeding with the lower  strength diet, 1-enk-IR levels in the globus pallidus and nucleus accumbens were  elevated. However, 3 weeks of the high strength Li diet did not lead to  alterations of 1-enk-IR content. In contrast, the release of 1-enk-IR was  potentiated but only in subjects in which the brain lithium exceeded a threshold  level. In another series of studies, we observed that hot-plate escape latency  was significantly elevated in rats fed the high strength Li diet for 3 weeks.  Also, the Li-treated animals had a greater morphine-induced elevation of escape  latency than controls; this effect was less effectively blocked by naltrexone.  These findings suggest that chronic exposure to Li leads to transiently elevated  levels of 1-enk, and, when brain Li levels are greater than 0.5 mEq/L, to a  potentiation of endogenous enkephalin release. The analgesia in Li-treated  subjects may eventually be related to these influences of the anti-manic drug on  enkephalinergic neurotransmission.","1982-10-18","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1837-1840","","16-17","31","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 7154836","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Rats, Inbred Strains; Tissue Distribution; Brain Chemistry; *Analgesia; Enkephalins/analysis/*metabolism; Lithium/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) being the enzymes of phase II metabolism  catalyse the conjugation of glucuronic acid to the lipophilic substrate by its  specific nucleophilic group. UGT isoenzymes of various substrate specificities  and different expression profiles in selected tissues belong to the large UGT  superfamily. Usually, glucuronidation is the detoxification process, but  sometimes (morphine, tamoxifen) glucuronides express biological activity higher  than or comparable to the native compound. The level of UGT gene expression is  individual for patients, because of their genetic status as well as epigenetic  conditions. Also, xenobiotics are able to modulate UGT level and gene expression  by the interaction with nuclear receptors. Moreover, one can find a lower level  of UGT in the tumour compared to normal tissue, which results in the protection  against deactivation of the drug and in the promotion of its selective activity  in tumor tissue. On the other hand, UGT activity is considered as the possible  cause of resistance to chemotherapy. Metabolism by hepatic and intestinal UGT  isoenzymes is responsible for the ""first-pass effect"", whereas acquired  resistance consists in the induction of UGT gene expression by the  chemotherapeutic or its metabolite. Moreover, UGT induction can be associated  with the induction of membrane transporters, particularly proteins of the ABC  family, responsible for drug excretion outside the cell. The above resistance  effects can be fortified by the overexpression of selected UGT isoenzymes  sometimes observed in specific types of tumours. It is also considered that many  advanced tumours are characterized by a higher level of β-glucuronidase. This  enzyme has a chance to be the molecular target of directed antitumour therapy, as  it catalyses β-glucuronide hydrolysis, leading to active aglycones.","2015-12-31","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1462-1477","","","69","","Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online)","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 27259218","","","","Humans; Substrate Specificity; Biological Transport; Liver/metabolism; Isoenzymes/metabolism; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism; Glucuronosyltransferase/*metabolism; *Prodrugs; Glucuronidase/metabolism; Xenobiotics/*metabolism; *Biotransformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, we identified a major metabolite of CPT-11 in  patients' plasma, 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino]  carbonyloxycamptothecin (APC), which is produced by the oxidation of the distal  piperidine ring (P. Rivory et al, Cancer Res., 56: 3689-3694, 1996). As with all  active camptothecin derivatives, CPT-11 is subject to spontaneous interconversion  between a lactone and a carboxylate form in aqueous media. The kinetics of  biotransformation of the two forms of CPT-11 into APC was studied using pooled  human liver microsomes. The formation of APC was characterized by the following  parameters: Km = 18.4 +/- 1.4 and 39.7 +/- 11.6 microM; and Vmax = 26.0 +/- 0.6  and 13.4 +/- 1.7 pmol/min/mg protein for the lactone and carboxylate forms of  CPT-11, respectively. This reaction was found to be catalyzed principally by  cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A because of three key results: (a) the CYP 3A-selective  inhibitors ketoconazole (1 microM) and troleandomycin (100 microM) inhibited APC  formation by 98 and 100%, respectively, mostly in a competitive way; (b) using  microsomes from transfected lymphoblastoid cells expressing specific CYPs, we  found that only those from CYP 3A4 cDNA-transfected cells transformed CPT-11 into  APC; and (c) using 15 individual preparations of human liver microsomes, we  observed highly significant correlations between the activity of CPT-11  metabolism into APC and both immunoreactivity with anti-CYP 3A antibodies and  testosterone 6beta hydroxylation, an activity specifically mediated by CYP 3A.  The effect on this metabolism of 11 drugs used at 100 microM was studied with  CPT-11 lactone at 25 microM. Amikacin, Bactrim, ciprofloxacin, rocephine,  5-fluorouracil, metoclopramide, morphine, and paracetamol had no effect, but  ondansetron, loperamide, and racecadotril inhibited this pathway by 25, 50, and  50%, respectively. These concentrations exceed those expected in vivo. APC  formation in patients may thus be influenced by coadministered ketoconazole  therapy and may decline after administration of CPT-11 because of the  lactonolysis of the latter.","1998-02-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","468-472","","3","58","","Cancer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9458091","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Structure-Activity Relationship; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Biotransformation/drug effects; Molecular Structure; *Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*metabolism; Ketoconazole/pharmacology; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism; Transfection; Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism; Irinotecan; Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology; Troleandomycin/pharmacology; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*metabolism/pharmacology; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2JIXFLHI","bookSection","2012","","Opioids.","LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury","","","","","The opioids are a large class of medications related in structure to the natural plant alkaloids found in opium that are derived from the resin of the opium  poppy, Papaver somniferum. The natural alkaloids are also referred to as opiates  and include morphine and codeine. Synthetic derivatives include heroin, fentanyl,  hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine and others. The opioids are highly potent  and effective analgesics, but most have a high potential for dependency and  abuse. Opioids act by engagement of specific cell surface receptors; the opiate  receptors, which are designated µ [mu], κ [kappa] and δ [delta]. These receptors  are found predominantly in the central nervous system, brain and spinal column,  but are also present on vascular, cardiac, lung, gut and even peripheral blood  mononuclear cells. Engagement of the opiate receptors generates a series of  intracellular signals, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, decreased  opening of calcium channels, increased potassium currents and activation of  protein kinase C (PKC). The major effect of these pathways is reduction in cell  excitability and neurotransmission. The natural ligands for the opiate receptors  are the so-called endogenous opioid peptides such as the enkephalins, endorphins  and endomorphins. The opioids have a variety of clinical effects, but are  predominantly known and used for their profound pain relieving effects. Other  effects that are often linked to opiate analgesia include euphoria, changes in  mood, drowsiness and mental clouding. However, the distinctive feature of the  analgesia induced by the opioids is the lack of loss of consciousness. The pain  is often described as less intense, but still present although better tolerated.  Thus, the opioids do not decrease or treat the cause of the painful stimulus, but  rather decrease its perception. Other effects of opioids include respiratory  depression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, sedation, nausea, vomiting,  constipation and intestinal bloating. Opioids also have direct cardiovascular  effects, decreasing blood pressure, causing vasodilation and decreasing cardiac  work. Most opioids have similar effects and side effects, although  pharmacokinetic differences, tissue distribution, and receptor type specificity  probably account for the variation in effects of the various synthetic and  semisynthetic derivatives of morphine. Morphine is considered the prototype  opiate, against which other agents are measured for their analgesic effects as  well as adverse side effects. The opioids can be categorized into subclasses on  the basis of their chemical structure as opium alkaloids (opiates: codeine,  morphine), semisynthetic derivatives of the natural alkaloids (hydrocodone,  hydromorphone, oxycodone, buprenorphine), and various classes of synthetic  opioids such as the anililopiperidines (fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil,  remifentanil), diphenylpropylamine derivatives (propoxyphene, dextropropoxyphene,  methadone, diphenoxylate, loperamide), and others (pentazocine, butorphanol,  nalbuphine, levorphanol, tramadol), and, the opioid antagonists (nalmefene,  naloxone and naltrexone). They can also be informally classified based upon their  major use such as anesthesia (fentanyl, alfentanil, remifentanil, sufentanil),  severe pain (morphine, hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine),  moderate-to-severe acute or chronic pain (transdermal or transbuccal fentanyl,  codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, levorphanol, methadone), diarrhea (loperamide,  diphenoxylate), and cough (codeine, hydrocodone). Finally, opioids can be  categorized on the basis of their action as full agonists, partial agonists or  mixed agonists/antagonists, and antagonists of opiate receptors. Opioid receptor  antagonists are used to reverse the effects of opioids and are invaluable in the  management of opioid overdose (naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene). Specialized  opioid antagonists can be used to reverse unwanted opioid effects, such as  constipation in patients with chronic pain on long-term opioids. These agents  (naldemedine, naloxegol) are generally modified so as not to cross the blood  brain and reverse the central nervous system effects of opiates. Opioids are rare  causes of drug induced liver disease and are not mentioned in large case series  of clinically apparent liver injury caused by medications. In physiological, pain  relieving doses, opioids have not been implicated in causing clinically apparent  liver injury, acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or vanishing bile duct  syndrome. However, overdoses of the more potent opioids have been linked to cases  of acute liver injury, usually with a precipitous onset and pattern of acute  toxicity with marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and early onset  of signs of hepatic failure. This syndrome has been best characterized after  buprenorphine overdose or abuse, but likely occurs with others. It is possible  that the implicated opioids are not directly toxic to the liver, but cause  ischemic liver injury due to respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, shock  and anoxia that can occur with severe opioid overdose. The clinical syndrome  resembles acute hepatic necrosis and liver failure, but is rapidly reversible and  rarely the primary cause of death from overdose. A special form of liver injury  linked to opioid use occurs with their fixed drug combinations with  acetaminophen. These combinations are commonly used for moderate to moderately  severe pain and can lead to abuse. If taken too frequently, acetaminophen doses  may reach toxic levels, particularly with overuse for several days in the face of  malnutrition, alcohol abuse or intercurrent illness. These other stresses can  lower hepatic glutathione levels and predispose to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.  This constellation of events is referred to as inadvertent or unintended  acetaminophen overdose or more colloquially as a “therapeutic misadventure”.  Because of their potential for hepatotoxicity, opioid combinations in which the  dose of acetaminophen is greater than 325 mg per tablet or capsule were  discontinued. References to the safety and hepatotoxic potential of the various  opiate agonists are given together at the end of this overview section.  References to the opioids and the opiate antagonists used to treat substance  abuse are given separately with each agent (buprenorphine, methadone, nalmefene,  naloxone, naltrexone). The opioids are discussed individually or as groups of  agents and links to each are given below. Full and partial agonists: Alfentanil .  Buprenorphine . Butorphanol . Codeine . Diphenoxylate .

Naloxone exacerbated both systemic and intestinal anaphylaxis when injected 10  and 90 min before the antigen challenge. This was evidenced by a more pronounced  drop in rectal temperature, higher hematocrit values, and by an enhanced  elevation of basal short-circuit current (an indication of the secretory tone of  the small intestine studied in Ussing chambers). Pretreatment with an equipotent  does of methylnaloxone (200 mg/kg i.p.), a peripherally acting opiate antagonist,  exacerbated the indices of intestinal anaphylaxis but had no apparent effect on  indices of systemic anaphylaxis.

The low oral  bioavailability (< 2%) of naloxone makes the precipitation of the acute opioid  withdrawal symptoms unlikely following oral oxycodone/naloxone exposure. The  incidence of acute opioid withdrawal symptoms following both oral and intravenous  administration of oxycodone/naloxone preparations has not been described.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and  circumstances associated with oxycodone/naloxone-induced acute opioid withdrawal.  METHODS: An observational case series of acute opioid withdrawal following  oxycodone/naloxone administration were selected from all calls received by the  Victoria Poisons Information Centre from January 2012 to December 2014. Data  collected included patient demographics, reported symptoms, type of caller,  intentional or accidental exposure and advice given. RESULTS: There were 107  reported exposures to oxycodone/naloxone preparations. Route of exposure was oral  in 92 (86%) and intravenous injection of crushed tablets in 14 (14%) of cases,  respectively. Nine callers had a history of long-standing opioid treatment and  developed withdrawal symptoms with oral oxycodone/naloxone. Temporal relationship  between first dose, increased dose and chewing tablets was described. There were  14 exposures to crushed oxycodone/naloxone tablets injected intravenously; all  precipitated an acute withdrawal state. DISCUSSION: The development of opioid  withdrawal symptoms with intravenous injection of oxycodone/naloxone is likely a  result of bypassing first-pass metabolism. Withdrawal symptoms after ingesting  increased dose, first dose or chewing oxycodone/naloxone suggests that there is a  systemic absorption of naloxone in opioid-dependent callers. CONCLUSION:  Oxycodone with naloxone tablets can lead to acute opioid withdrawal symptoms if  crushed and injected parentally. First dose, increased dose and chewing of these  opioid-naloxone combination tablets in opioid-dependent people can also result in  acute opioid withdrawal symptoms or diminished pain relief.","2015","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:46:14","","815-818","","8","53","","Clin Toxicol (Phila)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Wong2015a PMID: 26109423 place: England","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Risk Factors; Administration, Oral; Injections, Intravenous; Young Adult; Drug Combinations; Acute Disease; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Tablets; Incidence; Opioid; poisoning; Databases, Factual; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Oxycodone/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Antidote; Naloxone/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Narcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Poison Control Centers; Substance Abuse, Intravenous/diagnosis/*epidemiology/metabolism; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis/*epidemiology/metabolism; Therapeutic; Victoria/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this review is to describe  pharmacokinetic DDIs associated with opioids frequently encountered in managed  care settings (morphine, codeine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone,  hydromorphone, fentanyl, tramadol, and methadone). An introduction to the  pharmacokinetic basis of DDIs is provided, and potential DDIs associated with  opioids are reviewed. Opioids metabolized by the drug metabolizing enzymes of the  cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system (codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl,  tramadol, and methadone) are associated with numerous DDIs that can result in  either a reduction in opioid effect or excess opioid effects. Conversely, opioids  that are not metabolized by that system (morphine, oxymorphone, and  hydromorphone) tend to be involved in fewer CYP450-associated pharmacokinetic  DDIs.","2011-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","S276-287","","","17 Suppl 11","","Am J Manag Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 21999760","","","","Humans; Pharmacogenetics; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism; *Drug Interactions; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Managed Care Programs/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its use rapidly expanded thereafter to include  human medical treatments for a variety of acute and chronic disorders. Because of  reports of severe adverse effects, the US Food and Drug Administration withdrew  levamisole's approval for human use in 2000; however, medical options outside the  United States and illicit options worldwide allow continued accessibility to  levamisole. The compound is rapidly metabolized in the body, with at least 2  known active metabolites. Levamisole has a broad range of immunomodulatory  effects, including both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune responses.  It is generally well tolerated at therapeutic concentrations, although a variety  of autoimmune-related adverse effects have been reported, including  agranulocytosis, leukopenia, purpura, and visible necrotized skin tissue.  Individuals with levamisole-compromised immune systems are more susceptible to  infections, including COVID-19. Since the early 2000's, levamisole has been  frequently used as an adulterating agent in illicit street drugs, especially  cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. Although its prevalence has varied over time and  geographically, levamisole has been detected in up to 79% of the street supply of  cocaine at levels up to 74% by weight. Its presence in illicit drug markets also  raises concern over the potential for exposure of children and neonates, although  this is supported by only limited anecdotal evidence. Levamisole is not currently  included in routine drug testing panels, although a variety of confirmatory  testing techniques exist across a range of antemortem and postmortem specimen  options. Because of its varying presence in illicit drug markets, both the  medical and forensic communities need to be aware of levamisole and its potential  impact on toxicological investigations.","2021-04-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","221-228","","2","43","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Examples of such transporters are  p-glycoprotein (PGP), probenecid-sensitive transport mechanism, multidrug  resistance related protein 1-3, the organic anion transporter family, and the  organic anion transporter polypeptide family. The aim of present study was to  elucidate the mechanisms involved in transporting morphine's potent metabolite,  M6G. METHODS: M6G permeability via two cell lines; MDCKII and MDCK-PGP, was  compared with that of sucrose. M6G transport was examined in different  concentrations and in the presence of inhibitors of different transport systems  such as cyclosporine, digoxin and probenecid. M6G concentration was measured  using ELISA assay. The method was sensitive, reliable and reproducible. RESULTS:  The results confirmed that M6G could cross a layer of MDCK II or MDR-PGP cells  more than sucrose could. It was also observed that M6G is a PGP transporter  substrate. Its permeability was increased by the use of a PGP expressed cell  line, and also in the presence of a strong PGP inhibitor. Digoxin related  transporters such as Oatp2 may also involved in transport of M6G. M6G seemed to  be a glucose transporter 1 substrate, but was not a substrate to probenecid  sensitive transporters. MAJOR CONCLUSION: It is concluded that different  transporters are responsible for M6G transports via different membrane, which  could have effects on its pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.","2011","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","412-416","","6","19","","Daru","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 23008686  PMCID: PMC3436077","","","","morphine-6-glucuronide; transport; p-glycoprotein (PGP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We wanted to determine the accuracy of AC-PET in  measuring cardiac output (CO) using first-pass analysis and the indicator  dilution principle. Further, we wanted to investigate the pulmonary uptake of  acetate in relation to left atrial filling pressures and ventricular function.  METHODS: Twenty-four steady-state experiments were performed in 5 domestic pigs.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and CO by thermodilution (CO(thermo))  were recorded invasively simultaneous with AC-PET scans at baseline (n = 9),  dobutamine infusion (n = 6), high-dose metoprolol and morphine (n = 6), and  angiotensinamide infusion (n = 3). 1-(11)C-Acetate was injected as a rapid manual  bolus. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the right (RV) and left (LV)  heart cavities. Time-activity curves were constructed and the area under the  curve (AUC) was integrated from beginning the scan to the time of visually  determined recirculation by simple arithmetic. CO by PET (CO(PET)) was calculated  as injected dose/AUC. Image handling and curve analysis were repeated by a  blinded observer. Total pulmonary extravascular retention of (11)C, expressed as  percentage of injected dose (lung-uptake %ID), was measured using a combination  of transmission, (15)O-carbon monoxide, and AC-PET scans. RESULTS: CO(thermo)  ranged from 2.1 to 8.2 L/min. CO(PET) determined from both LV and RV was linearly  related to CO(thermo) with slopes close to 1 (LV, r = 0.98; RV, r = 0.96; both P  < 0.001). Interobserver reproducibility was r = 0.98, P < 0.001. The PCWP range  was 6-14 mm Hg and the lung-uptake %ID was 2.7-8.5 %ID. When normalized to  baseline, lung-uptake %ID was correlated with PCWP (r = 0.56, P = 0.01) and  linearly correlated with LV input resistance (PCWP divided by CO(thermo); r =  0.91, P < 0.001). When both lung-uptake %ID and stroke volume were normalized to  baseline, a piecewise linear relation was found (r = 0.95, P < 0.001).  CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that measurements of CO by AC-PET are feasible  and accurate. Using RV ROIs might favor CO measurements by any injectable PET  tracer. The lung-uptake %ID might be useful in evaluation of pulmonary  congestion, but further studies are needed.","2003-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1176-1183","","7","44","","J Nucl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12843234","","","","Animals; Reproducibility of Results; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Sensitivity and Specificity; Swine; Observer Variation; Indicator Dilution Techniques; Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics; Tomography, Emission-Computed/*methods; Cardiac Output/*physiology; *Acetates/pharmacokinetics; *Carbon/pharmacokinetics; *Ventricular Function; Heart Ventricles/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Lung/diagnostic imaging/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NADH or arachidonate  in place of GSH was also readily oxidized. Extensive oxygen uptake ensued  resulting in the formation of superoxide radicals and H2O2. Only catalytic  amounts of drugs and low peroxide levels were required, indicating a radox  cycling mechanism. Active drugs included morphine, phenothiazines, aminopyrine,  p-phenetidine, acetaminophen and 4-N,N-(CH3)2-aminophenol. Other drugs, including  dopamine and methyl-alpha-dopa, did not catalyze oxygen uptake, nor was GSH  oxidized to GSSG. Instead, GSH was depleted by GSH conjugate formation. Drugs of  the former group, e.g. acetaminophen, aminopyrine or N,N-(CH3)2-aniline, have  also been found by other investigators to form GSSG and hydrogen peroxide when  added to hepatocytes or when perfused through an isolated liver. Although  cytochrome P-450 normally catalyzes a two-electron oxidation of drugs, serious  consideration should be given to some one-electron oxidation occurring as well  and resulting in radical formation, oxygen activation and GSSG formation.","1987","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","63-72","","1","33","","Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 3114775","","","","Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Rats; Biotransformation; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism; *Oxygen Consumption; Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism; NAD/metabolism; Glutathione/metabolism; Arachidonic Acid; Arachidonic Acids/metabolism; Peroxidases/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The obesity rate is higher within the  adolescent age group as compared to preschool children. Childhood obesity is  particularly problematic, because the co-morbid disease states which accompany  obesity may require frequent pharmacotherapy and/ or surgical intervention.  Despite the potential for increased pharmacotherapy among obese patients, there  is a paucity of dosing guidelines for this special population. Optimal drug  dosing in obese pediatric patients has not been sufficiently explored as the  present data available are mostly specific for obese adults. In this review, we  present an overview concerning what is currently known about the pharmacokinetics  and pharmacogenetics of frequently used drugs including midazolam, fentanyl and  its newer derivatives, morphine, ketamine, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and  enoxaparin in obese adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery.

Hepatic microsomes were isolated from control and phenobarbital induced young (4  mo), adult (11 mo) and senescent (27 mo) Fischer 344 rats. Bioactivation and  subsequent covalent binding were studied with 14C-labeled 1,2-dibromoethane,  carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, and 1, 1, 2-trichloroethane. With  control rats, levels of binding increased slightly between 4 and 11 mo; however  the values decreased 50-75% in the 27 mo group compared to the 11 mo group. No  significant differences were noted between phenobarbital induced groups with  regards to bioactivation of the aliphatic halides and their covalent binding to  proteins and lipids. As an explanation for the decreased bioactivation ability in  the senescent rats, they were also found to have significantly less hepatic  cytochrome P-450 (-35%), NADPH cytochrome C reductase (-31%), and ethyl-morphine  N-demethylase activity (-43%) when compared to the 11 mo age group. These  differences were reduced when comparisons were made between the various age  groups of phenobarbital induced animals. This suppression may indicate a  decreased potential for the expression of toxicities requiring bioactivation.","1982-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","493-502","","3","36","","Res Commun Chem Pathol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6812184","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Biotransformation; Microsomes, Liver/metabolism; Enzyme Induction/drug effects; *Aging; Phenobarbital/pharmacology; Rats, Inbred F344; Aflatoxins/metabolism; Aflatoxin B1; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NMN accumulation was highest and saturable in S2 and S3 segments, but lowest and  nonsaturable in S1 segments. In S1 segments, accumulation of [3H]-NMN (0.5-8  microM in the bath) resulted in an average tubular water/medium concentration  ratio (T/M) of 8.2, whereas in S2 and S3 segments T/M averaged 19.5 and 18.6,  respectively. At these concentrations, about 30% of the label was attached in all  segments to a metabolite comigrating with nicotinamide. KCN (10(-2) M) or ouabain  (10(-4) M) reduced T/M to about 8 for all segments. NMN accumulation was  inhibited (to a T/M of about 3 with mepiperphenidol) by other organic cations  (10(-5)-10(-3) M) with the potency sequence mepiperphenidol greater than  tetraethylammonium = quinine greater than morphine, these organic cations having  no effect on p-aminohippurate accumulation, except for the highest concentration  of quinine (10(-3) M). After correction for metabolism, NMN accumulation could be  accounted for by simple electrochemical equilibrium across the basolateral  membrane. The basolateral step of NMN transport appears therefore to be a  carrier-mediated diffusion, in opposition to the active basolateral accumulation  described for tetraethylammonium.","1990-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","444-451","","2","253","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2140128","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rabbits; Drug Interactions; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism; Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/pharmacokinetics; p-Aminohippuric Acid/analysis/pharmacokinetics; Potassium Cyanide/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  distribution pattern of enkephalin immunoreactivity in brain, including human  brain, is quite different from that of beta-endorphin immunoreactivity.  Separation of beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin by column chromatography  revealed that the contribution of beta-lipotropin to beta-endorphin  immunoreactivity in brain is very small. In the anterior lobe of the pituitary  both beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin were found, whereas in the  intermediate/posterior lobe almost all immunoreactivity was due to  beta-endorphin; considerable amounts of enkephalin were also detected. Raising  the concentration of potassium ions stimulated the release of met- and  leu-enkephalin from striatal slices and the release of beta-endorphin  immunoreactive material(s) from hypothalamic slices; both phenomena were  dependent upon the presence of calcium ions. Studies of the release of  beta-endorphin from isolated rat pituitaries revealed characteristic differences  between the anterior and intermediate/posterior lobes; e.g., lysine vasopressin  and extracts from the median eminence were highly effective in releasing  beta-endorphin from the anterior lobe without affecting the release from the  intermediate/posterior lobe; on the other hand, dopamine inhibited beta-endorphin  release from the intermediate/posterior lobe without affecting release from the  anterior lobe. Increased beta-endorphin levels were found after various stress  conditions in rat plasma, as well as after treatment with metyrapone and  vasopressin. In normal human plasma significant amounts of beta-endorphin were  detected; increased levels were found in Addison's, Nelson's and Cushing's  disease. Chronic opiate treatment of rats for 10 days did not affect brain levels  of enkephalin or the beta-endorphin content of the hypothalamus, pituitary and  plasma. Precipitated withdrawal decreased beta-endorphin in the anterior lobe and  hypothalamus and increased beta-endorphin levels in the plasma. Long-term  morphine treatment (30 days) decreased enkephalin and beta-endorphin content in  some brain areas and in the intermediate/posterior pituitary lobe but not in the  anterior lobe.","1980","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","11-21","","","16","","Prog Biochem Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 7443728","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Tissue Distribution; Brain/metabolism; Opioid-Related Disorders/metabolism; Enkephalins/metabolism; Endorphins/*physiology; Pituitary Gland/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke induce hepatic aryl hydrocarbon  hydroxylase and cytochrome P448 and increased levels of these enzymes are  responsible for a higher metabolic clearance of drugs which are substrates for  these enzymes. The clinical significance of this induction is greatest for those  drugs with a low therapeutic index such as theophylline. In some cases a  modification of the normal therapeutic dose is justified to maintain adequate  control. The magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking on the induction of  hepatic metabolic activity has been linked with age for a number of drugs  including theophylline, some benzodiazepines and propranolol. Generally, the  inductive effect is smaller in the elderly but, as there is no direct correlation  between chronological age and physiological age, it is imperative that age and  smoking habits be treated as individual sources of intersubject variation in  pharmacokinetics and that this be borne in mind in the evaluation of new drugs  and the safe clinical use of existing ones.","1983-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","479-487","","7","5","","Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 6366402","","","","Humans; Theophylline/metabolism; Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism; Codeine/metabolism; *Smoking; Phenacetin/metabolism; Acetaminophen/metabolism; Warfarin/metabolism; Antipyrine/metabolism; Propranolol/metabolism; Chlorpromazine/metabolism; Benzodiazepines/metabolism; Clomipramine/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate differences with parenteral administration. DATA SOURCES:  Pharmacokinetics and clinical studies published in recent years in indexed  journals. STUDY SELECTION: Based on the study methodology, drugs employed and  pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: Factors involved in  absorption of drugs from the rectal mucosa, clinical effect and pharmacokinetic  data of the following drugs: diazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam, ketamin and  methohexital, then a brief evaluation of other drugs: thiopental, etomidate,  morphine and chloral hydrate. DATA SYNTHESIS: The most widely used drugs are  benzodiazepines: they are safe, easy to manage and highly effective; among them  midazolam has the best kinetic and dynamic pattern. Ketamin is useful during  painful diagnostic procedures; with the use of barbiturates there is a greater  risk of respiratory depression and more caution must be employed. CONCLUSIONS:  Wide intervariability of rate of absorption, achievement of plasma levels and  clinical effect is a relevant drawback of this technique, such to make it not  preferable to the parenteral route, when both are feasible.

Consequently, toxicology testing programs are frequently  implemented for both forensic and clinical applications. Understanding opioid  metabolism and disposition is essential for assessing risk of toxicity and, in  some cases, providing additional information regarding risk of therapeutic  failure. Opioids significantly metabolized by the cytochromeP450 (CYP450) enzyme  system maybe subjectto drug-drug interactions, including codeine, hydrocodone,  oxycodone, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, buprenorphine, and tramadol. CYP2D6  metabolism is polymorphic, and pharmacogenetic testing has been investigated for  codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, and hydrocodone. CYP2B6 pharmacogenetic testing of  methadone may reduce the risk of cardiac toxicity associated with the  S-enantiomer. Opioids metabolized primarily by uridine  5'-diphospho-glucuronsyltransferase (UGT) enzymes include morphine,  hydromorphone, dihydrocodeine, oxymorphone, levorphanol, and tapentadol. Parent  and metabolite disposition is described for blood, oral fluid, and urine. Parent  drug is most commonly detected in blood and oral fluid, whereas metabolites  typically predominate in urine. Oral fluid/blood ratios exceed 1 for most  opioids, making this an excellent alternative matrix for testing of this drug  class. Metabolites of codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone are commercially  available, and knowledge of metabolism is necessary for correct interpretation.","2015-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","115-145","","2","27","","Forensic Sci Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: China (Republic : 1949- ) PMID: 26227254","","","","Humans; Animals; Risk Assessment; Biotransformation; Drug Monitoring; Pain/*drug therapy; Biomarkers/blood/urine; Substance Abuse Detection; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Prescription Drugs/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Substance-Related Disorders/blood/diagnosis/*metabolism/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there is a large clinical experience with  midazolam in the PICU population and it remains the most commonly used  benzodiazepine in this setting, lorazepam may provide an effective alternative,  with a longer half-life and more predictable pharmacokinetics without the concern  of active metabolites. However, there are limited reports regarding its use in  the PICU population, and concerns exist regarding the potential for toxicity  related to its diluent, propylene glycol. Although the synthetic opioid fentanyl  frequently is chosen for use in the PICU setting because of its hemodynamic  stability, preliminary data suggest morphine may have a slower development of  tolerance and may cause fewer withdrawal symptoms than fentanyl. Morphine's  safety profile includes long-term follow-up studies that have demonstrated no  adverse central nervous system developmental effects from its use in neonates and  infants. In the critically ill infant at risk following surgery for congenital  heart disease, clinical experience supports the use of the synthetic opioids,  given their ability to modulate PVR and prevent pulmonary hypertensive crisis.  Alternatives to the benzodiazepines and opioids include ketamine, pentobarbital,  or dexmedetomidine. Ketamine may be useful for patients with hemodynamic  instability or airway reactivity. There are limited reports regarding the use of  pentobarbital in the PICU, with one study raising concerns of a high incidence of  adverse effects associated with its use. Propofol has gained great favor in the  adult population as a means of providing deep sedation while allowing for rapid  awakening; however, its routine use is not recommended because of its potential  association with ""propofol infusion syndrome.""

After parenteral administration of therapeutic doses it is approximately equipotent  with morphine, and has proved at least as effective an analgesic as morphine,  pethidine (meperidine) and butorphanol in moderate to severe postoperative pain.  However, preliminary pharmacodynamic data indicate that the ceiling of analgesic  activity of dezocine occurs at a higher level of analgesia than that of reference  agonist/antagonist agents. Also, the drug exhibited a morphine-like degree of  anaesthetic-sparing activity in animals. Although long term data are very  limited, single doses of dezocine are well tolerated, with mild and transient  sedation and gastrointestinal upset the principal adverse effects. As with some  other agonist/antagonist analgesics, a 'ceiling' effect to dezocine-induced  respiratory depression occurs with increasing dosage, beyond which further  depression has not been observed. In single analgesic doses, however, dezocine is  a slightly more potent respiratory depressant than morphine. Clinically important  haemodynamic changes have not been observed with usual analgesic doses of  dezocine. As an agonist/antagonist opioid, the dependence liability of dezocine  would be expected to be lower than that of pure agonist opioids, but extended  clinical use is required before more definitive conclusions can be drawn in this  regard. Unlike older drugs of its type, dezocine produced opiate-like subjective  effects and was identified as morphine-like by drug abusers. Thus, provided the  promising conclusions of currently available clinical studies are confirmed with  its wider use, dezocine should be a useful additional agent for the treatment of  moderate to severe postoperative pain.","1989-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","226-248","","2","38","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2670517","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Tetrahydronaphthalenes; Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic; Analgesics/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Cycloparaffins/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach for investigating this question is to study the circadian  rhythm of patients' requests for analgesics. We included 40 patients with  malignant disease and intolerable pain despite treatment with weak opioids. Weak  opioids were stopped and the patients' pain treatment was restricted for the next  2 days to strong oral opioids (ketobemidone) given on an as-needed basis. The  number and times of all ketobemidone administrations were recorded. No  significant diurnal variation in use of ketobemidone was observed. A descriptive  curve that interpolates between successive observations displayed only slight  circadian fluctuations of opioid consumption.

The epidural  space is located between the dura mater (the outer-most membrane surrounding the  spinal cord) and the vertebral canal. The site of catheter placement is  determined by the dermatomes corresponding to the site of desired analgesia. The  primary factors that differentiate epidural narcotics are related to their  pharmacokinetic profiles. Morphine, which is hydrophilic, has a slower onset of  action and a longer duration of analgesia than lipophilic compounds such as  fentanyl; morphine also results in less segmentalization (the degree to which  analgesia is limited to discrete dermatomal segments corresponding to the level  of the epidural narcotic injection) than is seen with lipophilic compounds.  Studies have shown that epidural narcotics provide superior pain relief compared  with systemic narcotics. Common adverse effects associated with therapeutic doses  of intraspinal narcotics include itching, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention,  and sedation; respiratory depression is uncommon after epidural administration of  narcotics. The most bothersome adverse effect encountered with analgesic doses of  local anesthetics is paresthesia. Solutions for epidural administration must be  sterile and preservative free.

METHODS: Tissues were obtained at autopsy, as requested by the patient, for MTX  analysis after 5 doses of the drug were injected into his cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) 6 to 21 days before death. A radioligand assay was used to measure the  concentration of MTX in multiple tissues. RESULTS: Outside the neuraxis, MTX was  found in highest concentration in the liver, kidney, lymph nodes, and spleen.  Lung and bone also had substantial concentrations. Skeletal muscle had the lowest  concentrations of measurable drug and the drug was not detected in the heart. In  retrospect, the patient's second course of systemic chemotherapy resulted in  greater systemic toxicities because intrathecal MTX was given in conjunction with  this course of treatment. In addition, hypersensitivity to intrathecal morphine  may have been caused by concomitant intrathecal MTX therapy. CONCLUSIONS:  Physicians administering intrathecal MTX must be aware of the paradoxically  greater systemic exposure of the drug after intrathecal administration than after  systemic administration, the need to expect greater systemic toxicities of  intrathecal MTX, and the possibility that it may induce a hypersensitivity to  concomitant intrathecal morphine.","1997-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","530-532","","6","19","","J Pediatr Hematol Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9407940","","","","Humans; Male; Aged; Tissue Distribution; Injections, Spinal; Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/secondary; Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology; Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/secondary; Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Spinal Cord Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/secondary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Eight adult  castrated male donkeys were given intravenous (IV) 0.9% saline, morphine  0.1 mg/kg bwt (LDM), or morphine 0.5 mg/kg bwt (HDM) in a randomised order with a  minimum 1-week washout period. Mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNTs) were  determined by a blinded investigator pre-injection and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,  150, 180, 210, 240, 300, and 360 min post-injection. Venous blood samples were  collected pre-injection and 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min  post-injection. Data were analysed using Friedman's test with Dunn's post hoc  test for multiple comparisons. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for the  HDM treatment. RESULTS: Baseline MNT was [median (interquartile range)] 8.9  (7.1-10.3) N and did not differ between treatments. Peak MNTs occurred at 60 min  for both LDM (16.2 N) and HDM (25.0 N) treatments.

SETTINGS/PATIENTS: We studied 15 patients, with chronic cancer pain, who were  afferent to Hospice of Rimini, Italy, were in therapy with high doses of opioid  and needed opioid rotation or a therapeutic variation because of opioid toxicity,  inefficacy, tolerance, or hyperalgesia. Each patient received a fixed dose of  endovenous morphine and clonidine plus oral ketoprofen or ibuprofen, and oral  lorazepam, if required, for at least 3 days, suspending the previous opioid  therapy. We monitored withdrawal symptoms, pain intensity, type, and intensity of  adverse events. RESULTS: Withdrawal symptoms were experienced by four (26.6  percent) patients. The average Numerical Rating Scale for pain decreased  significantly (p < 0.05) from 8.3 ± 1.57 to 3.6 ± 1.4 at the end of the  detoxification and to 2.4 ± 1 at the end of the rotation or therapeutic  adjustment. Average duration of the detoxification was 6.86 ± 6.4 days (range  3-22). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the detoxification protocol may be  effective in preventing withdrawal signs in patients needing a therapeutic change  because of opioid-induced tolerance, hyperalgesia, or toxicity.","2012-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","292-298","","5","8","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23247906","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Inactivation, Metabolic; Drug Tolerance; Neoplasms/*physiopathology; Chronic Pain/*drug therapy; *Palliative Care; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zomepirac is a new nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) approved for the treatment of mild to moderately  severe pain. The drug is well absorbed when given orally. It undergoes extensive  biotransformation in the liver. Zomepirac shares the pharmacology of the other  NSAIAs by decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. The efficacy of zomepirac has been  demonstrated primarily in acute forms of pain with associated inflammatory  processes including postdental-extraction, postpartum, and postoperative pain.  Many of these studies have been single-dose evaluations. Zomepirac sodium 100 mg  has been reported to be approximately equivalent to one to two tablets of  aspirin-phenacetin-caffeine (APC) with codeine 30 mg. In two studies, zomepirac  sodium 100 mg compared favorably with morphine sulfate 8 and 16 mg i.m. It has  been shown to be superior to aspirin 650 mg in oral-surgery patients. In  osteoarthritis, daily doses of zomepirac sodium 400-600 mg are approximately  equivalent to aspirin 3200-4800 mg. Zomepirac has side effects similar to  high-dose aspirin. Zomepirac is associated with an increased incidence of  urogenital symptoms such as dysuria and pyuria. Because of tumorigenicity in  rats, the drug is contraindicated in children, pregnant women, and nursing  mothers. The drug has not demonstrated any potential for physical dependence,  withdrawal, or tolerance. Zomepirac may provide a suitable alternative to  aspirin, narcotic/NSAIA combinations, and narcotics in the treatment of mild to  moderately severe pain. It is unlikely that zomepirac will replace narcotics in  more severe types of pain.","1981-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1293-1301","","9","38","","Am J Hosp Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7025615","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Animals; Drug Interactions; Chemistry; Chemical Phenomena; Costs and Cost Analysis; Drug Tolerance; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Pyrroles/*therapeutic use; Analgesics/*therapeutic use; Substance-Related Disorders; Tolmetin/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The organic  cation transporters (OCTs, SLC22A) are expressed in the intestine, liver, and  kidneys and are of importance in determining systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) and  tissue-specific exposure of drugs and metabolites. AREAS COVERED: An overview of  the role of OCTs in drug disposition is presented. Genetic variation in OCTs and  the effects on PK and drug response were discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical  studies demonstrated significance of OCT1 and OCT2 in the hepatic uptake and  renal secretion of drug, respectively. These mechanisms are important in  determining the systemic PK and tissue exposure and thus pharmacodynamics of  several drugs (e.g. metformin, morphine, sumatriptan). Emerging pharmacogenomic  data also suggests multidrug and toxin extrusion pump (MATE1, SLC47A1)  contribution to PK and response of drugs like metformin and cisplatin.  Considerations to genotyping of functional and common variants of OCTs should be  given, particularly for cationic drugs with hepatic elimination or renal  secretion being major clearance pathways, in the clinical development. While the  current evidence indicate that pharmacokinetic variability associated with known  genotypes of OCTs/MATEs is relatively small, they may be of relevance in the  tissue-specific effects and for drugs with low therapeutic index.","2023-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","149-164","","3","19","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37070463","","","","Humans; Genetic Variation; pharmacokinetics; Drug Development; Drug transporters; drug development; Cisplatin; *Metformin/pharmacokinetics; organic cation transporters; *Organic Cation Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism; genetic variation; Organic Cation Transporter 2/genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphine, methadone, and  buprenorphine are the most common first-line treatments, whereas clonidine and  phenobarbital are generally reserved for adjunctive therapy. These drugs exhibit  substantial pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) variability. Current  pharmacological treatments for NOWS are based on institutional protocols and  largely rely on empirical treatment of patient symptoms. AREAS COVERED: This  article reviews the PK/PD of NOWS pharmacotherapies with a focus on the  implication of physiological development and maturation. Body size-standardized  clearance is consistently low in neonates, except for methadone. This can be  ascribed to underdeveloped metabolic and elimination pathways. The effects of  pharmacogenetics have been clarified especially for morphine. The PK/PD  relationship of medications used in the treatment of NOWS is generally  understudied. EXPERT OPINION: Providing an appropriate opioid dose in neonates is  challenging. Advancements in quantitative pharmacology and PK/PD modeling  approaches facilitate identification of key factors driving PK/PD variability and  characterization of exposure-response relationships. PK/PD model-informed  simulations have been widely employed to define age-appropriate pediatric dosing  regimens. The model-informed approach holds promise to aid more rational use of  medications in the treatment of NOWS.","2021-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 06:00:22","","87-103","","1","17","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= VanHoogdalem2021 PMID: 33049155 place: England","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; pharmacokinetics; Pharmacogenetics; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; pharmacogenetics; pharmacodynamics; clonidine; Buprenorphine; morphine; methadone; Opioid-Related Disorders/*complications; neonatal abstinence syndrome; Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome/*drug therapy; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Opiate Substitution Treatment/*methods; neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome; phenobarbital; Pregnancy Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of centrally  administered butorphanol on agonist-stimulated G protein coupling was examined in  the rat brain, using in situ guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate  (GTPgammaS) binding autoradiography. Rats were treated with butorphanol (26  nmol/microl/h) by intracerebroventricular infusion via osmotic minipumps for 3  days. The distribution of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in the brain 7 h after the  termination of butorphanol infusion was measured in the presence or absence of  the selective kappa-opioid agonist, U-50,488. This agonist significantly  increased [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in the parietal cortex, caudate putamen,  thalamus, and central gray of control rats, but not in those regions of the  butorphanol-infused animals. These results suggest that chronic administration of  butorphanol developed tolerance and abolished U-50,488 activation of G proteins  in these brain areas.","2000-05-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","17-20","","1","52","","Brain Res Bull","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10779697","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tissue Distribution/drug effects; Infusion Pumps; Injections, Intraventricular; Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology; Narcotics/pharmacology; Sulfur Radioisotopes; Receptors, Opioid, kappa/*agonists; 3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide, (trans)-Isomer/*pharmacology; Butorphanol/*pharmacology; Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is presently no ideal opioid  available for epidural use. Comparative pharmacokinetic data help to select the  appropriate epidural opioid. Morphine (provided it is given in small doses and  volumes) is very appropriate for epidural pain treatment, especially for longer  periods of treatment, due to excellent analgesia and very low systemic morphine  concentrations. The faster onset of analgesia with epidural pethidine, alfentanil  und fentanyl make these opioids recommendable. However, due to the increased risk  of respiratory depression during continuous treatment, these drugs should not be  given over extended periods. Epidural administration of methadone, sufentanil und  buprenorphine cannot be recommended since the advantages over systemic use do not  outweigh the risks. Epidural tramadol may be useful in clinical routine, if  opioids are not available and supervision of the patient is not guaranteed,  because tramadol is not restricted by law and has a low potential for central  depressive effects. The safety of the patients should be paramount. If patients  are harmed by inappropriate opioids or dose regimens this will discredit a  valuable for treating postoperative pain. Postoperative epidural dosages should  be as low as possible and be titrated to the patient's individual needs for  analgesia. Epidural morphine treatment is an alternative to step 4 of the WHO  treatment regimen for patients with intractable pain or those suffering from  systemic opioid side effects. Careful selection of patients helps to increase  successful treatment. If implantable devices (ports or pumps, according to the  life expectancy) are employed, the intrathecal route of administration is  preferable to the epidural route, as the latter has a 10 times higher morphine  dose requirement.","1996-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","665-670","","7","67","","Chirurg","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8776538","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Monitoring; Drug Therapy, Combination; *Analgesia, Epidural; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Pain, Postoperative/blood/*drug therapy/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endomorphin-1, a newly-isolated endogenous opioid ligand,  shows the greatest selectivity and affinity for the mu-opiate receptor of any  endogenous substance found to date and may serve as a natural ligand for the  mu-opiate receptor. We examined the antinociceptive effects of endomorphin-1  administered intrathecally (i.t.) in the rat tail flick, tail pressure and  formalin tests. Intrathecal endomorphin-1 produced dose-dependent antinociceptive  effects in the three tests. ED50 (CI95) values for antinociception of i.t.  endomorphin-1 in the tail flick test and tail pressure test were 1.9 (0.96-3.76)  nmol and 1.8 (0.8-4.2) nmol, respectively. ED50 (CI95) values for phase 1 and  phase 2 in the formalin test were 12.5 (7.9-19.8) nmol and 17.5 (10.2-30) nmol,  respectively. Pretreatment with i.t. beta-funaltrexamine (a mu-opioid receptor  selective antagonist) significantly antagonized the antinociceptive effects of  endomorphin-1 in the three tests. Beta-funaltrexamine alone had not effects on  the three tests. The antinociceptive effects of endomorphin-1 were also  antagonized by i.t. yohimbine (an alpha 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonist). The  combination of ineffective doses of i.t. clonidine (an alpha 2-adrenoceptor  agonist) and endomorphin-1 produced a significant antinociception in the three  tests. The results showed that intrathecal endomorphin-1 produced antinociception  in a dose-dependent manner in the rat tail flick, tail pressure and formalin  tests, which was mediated by spinal mu-opioid receptors and modulated by alpha  2-adrenoceptors.","2000-03-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","PL195-204","","15","66","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 11210721","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Area Under Curve; Reaction Time/drug effects; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacology; Injections, Spinal; Analgesics/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, mu/agonists; Pain Measurement/*drug effects; Formaldehyde; Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; Yohimbine/pharmacology; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we demonstrated that met5-enkephalin was  degraded with the release of tyrosine by resting human PMN, whereas it was  degraded as well as oxidized to its sulfoxide derivative, met5-(O)-enkephalin, by  phagocytosing PMN. PMN also degraded met5-(O)-enkephalin but to a lesser extent.  Bacitracin at 1 gm/L inhibited the degradation and oxidation of met5-enkephalin  without affecting the production of superoxide and viability of PMN. The  oxidation of met5-enkephalin by phagocytosing PMN was inhibited by catalase or  NaN3 but not by SOD. This suggests that the oxidation of met5-enkephalin by  phagocytosing PMN was, at least in part, dependent on the MPO system  (MPO-H2O2-halide). Using purified canine MPO, we further demonstrated that  MPO-H2O2-CI- oxidized met5-enkephalin to met5-(O)-enkephalin. The MPO-mediated  oxidation of met5-enkephalin was inhibited by methionine but not by methionine  sulfoxide, tyrosine, glycine, or phenylalanine, confirming that it was the  methionine moiety of met5-enkephalin which was oxidized. Since both the sulfoxide  derivative and the degradation products met5-enkephalin have reduced opiate  agonist activity, oxidation and degradation of met5-enkephalin by PMN may  contribute to the pain at the site of inflammation.

Its long-term administration increases the  incidence of nosocomial infections, which contributes to the high mortality rate  of these patients. However, the mechanism of its immunosuppressing effect remains  unknown. METHODS: The effect of thiopental (200-1000 microg/ml) on the activation  of the nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB; electrophoretic mobility  shift assays), on NF-kappaB-driven reporter gene activity (transient transfection  assays), on the expression of NF-kappaB target genes (enzyme-linked  immunoassays), on T-cell activation (flow cytometric analyses of CD69  expression), and on the content of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha (Western  blotting) was studied in human T lymphocytes in vitro. RESULTS: Thiopental  inhibited the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB but did not alter  the activity of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding  protein. Other barbiturates (methohexital), anesthetics (etomidate, propofol,  ketamine), or opioids (fentanyl, morphine) did not affect NF-kappaB activation.  Thiopental-mediated suppression of NF-kappaB could be observed in Jurkat cells  and in primary CD3+ lymphocytes from healthy volunteers, was time- and  concentration-dependent, occurred at concentrations that are clinically achieved,  and persisted for hours after the incubation. It was associated with an  inhibition of NF-kappaB-driven reporter gene activity, of the expression of  interleukin-2, -6, and -8, and interferon gamma, and of the activation of CD3+  lymphocytes. Suppression of NF-kappaB appeared to involve reduced degradation of  IkappaB-alpha. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that thiopental inhibits the  activation of NF-kappaB and may thus provide a molecular mechanism for some of  the immunosuppressing effects associated with thiopental therapy.","2002-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1202-1213","","5","96","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11981162","","","","Humans; Biotransformation/drug effects; Indicators and Reagents; Blotting, Western; Genes, Reporter/genetics; Electrophoresis; Cytokines/metabolism; Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism; Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects; T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism; NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors; Hypnotics and Sedatives/*pharmacology; Jurkat Cells; Thiopental/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After systemic  administration, only a small amount was detected in the brain, but analgesia was  observed. Because halogenation of enkephalin analogs has been shown to increase  the brain uptake after systemic administration, our research group synthesized  both p-[Cl-Phe4,4']biphalin and p-[F-Phe4,4']biphalin. The aim of the present  study was to characterize and compare the blood-to-central nervous system (CNS)  pharmacokinetics and biological stability of biphalin and related halogenated  analogs. The initial screening used an in vitro blood-brain barrier model and  identified p-[Cl-Phe4,4')biphalin as the enkephalin analog with the best  potential for greater CNS entry. The CNS uptake and stability of biphalin and  p-[Cl-Phe4,4']biphalin was examined further using an in situ brain perfusion  technique coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Both  biphalin and its chlorohalogenated analog, were found to significantly enter the  CNS through both the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers.  Chlorohalogenation of biphalin was shown to both improve CNS entry, most likely  through an enhancement in lipophilicity, and increase biological stability. This  study suggests that incorporation of chlorohalogens at the p-Phe4,4' position is  a promising structural modification in the development of biphalin as a  successful opioid drug for the clinic.","1996-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1049-1057","","3","276","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8786534","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cattle; Radioligand Assay; Central Nervous System/*metabolism; Analgesics/*pharmacology; Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects; Sucrose/metabolism; Enkephalins/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacology; Opioid Peptides/*metabolism/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vasopressin facilitates, while oxytocin attenuates memory consolidation and  retrieval. These influences are located in different regions of the molecules.  Thus, the neurohypophyseal hormones act as precursor molecules for neuropeptides  involved in memory processes. The covalent ring structures of both vasopressin  and oxytocin mainly affect consolidation; the linear parts, retrieval processes;  while nearly the whole oxytocin or vasotocin molecule is needed for attenuation  of consolidation and retrieval. Regional studies, utilizing microdissection  techniques in combination with a sensitive radioenzymatic catecholamine assay,  revealed a distinct pattern of effects on cerebral alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine  methylester-induced catecholamine disappearance following intraventricular  vasopressin administration in limbic midbrain structures. In situations in which  the amount of bioavailable vasopressin in the brain is absent, as is the case in  the Brattleboro rat with hereditary diabetes insipidus, or neutralized in normal  Wistar rats following the intraventricular administration of antivasopressin  serum, regional catecholamine disappearance in most cases is altered in a  direction opposite to that observed after intracerebroventricular vasopressin  administration. These results indicate that vasopressin modulates memory  processes by modulation of neurotransmission in distinct catecholamine systems.  Recent experiments suggest that the influence of vasopressin on memory  consolidation is mediated by the dorsal noradrenergic bundle via terminal regions  of this bundle.","1979-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","2348-2354","","9","38","","Fed Proc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 110623","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Biological Availability; Chemistry; Chemical Phenomena; Brain/metabolism; Drug Tolerance; Amnesia/drug therapy; Catecholamines/physiology; Heroin Dependence/physiopathology; Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones/physiology; Memory/drug effects/*physiology; Morphine Dependence/physiopathology; Oxytocin/physiology; Pituitary Gland, Posterior/*physiology; Vasopressins/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/*physiology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Glucuronidation and  glutathione conjugation pathways were studied in vitro in obese and lean Zucker  rats after phenobarbital treatment. Obese Zucker rats demonstrated a higher  glucuronidation capacity as evidenced by a higher formation clearance of  acetaminophen glucuronide and greater UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT)  activity toward acetaminophen and p-nitrophenol compared with lean controls.  Sulfate and glutathione conjugation pathways were not affected by genetic  obesity. Obese Zucker rats possessed a higher total hepatic glutathione content  due to greater liver weight. Phenobarbital treatment enhanced glucuronidation of  acetaminophen and structurally related compounds (i.e., p-nitrophenol) similarly  in both phenotypes, but the treatment failed to induce morphine UDPGT in the  obese Zucker rat. No effect of phenobarbital was observed on sulfate conjugation,  gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase activity or hepatic glutathione content in  obese or lean Zucker rats. Similar increases in glutathione transferase  activities were observed in animals of both phenotypes after phenobarbital  treatment. This study demonstrates that glucuronidation is enhanced in  genetically obese rats, whereas phenobarbital causes normal induction of several  enzymes of the glucuronidation and glutathione conjugation pathways in the obese  Zucker rat.

One of the  potential reasons for the high incidence of surgical patients complaining  moderate to severe pain is the difficult application of the currently recommended  analgesic techniques in clinical practice. In particular, morphine, the most  commonly used systemic opioid in the POP treatment, has some unfavorable  pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics for POP management,  suggesting a potential relevant improvement by using different opioids. Many of  sufentanil properties make it particularly suitable for POP control: a high  affinity for the µ opioid receptor, the highest therapeutic index compared to any  other opioid used in clinical practice and the absence of clinically relevant  active metabolites. The elevated potency, together with the high lipophilicity of  sufentanil, allow the preparation of a nanotablet, 3 mm of diameter and 0.75 mm  of thickness, containing 15 µg of active drug. The sublingual route allows a  longer time of drug plasmatic permanence in comparison to IV route, overcoming  the need for continuous dosing. The patient-controlled system, considered in the  present review, is preprogrammed to deliver one sublingual tablet of sufentanil  with a 20-minute lockout period with a radiofrequency identification thumb tag  allowing only the patient to activate the on demand button. Phase II and III  studies have assessed the efficacy of this system in POP management, showing that  it was considered more satisfactory than the IV PCA morphine system by both  patients and nurses. The introduction of this simple and innovative system of  patient-controlled analgesic administration could represent an opportunity for  Italy to update the current practice in POP management.","2016-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1411-1422","","7","20","","Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 27097966","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Half-Life; Acute Disease; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism; Tablets; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy; Italy; Kidney/physiology; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Administration, Sublingual; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Sufentanil/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heroin maintained responding in rats with an inverted  U-shaped dose-effect curve and administration of 10 nmol of beta-funaltrexamine  i.c.v. (beta-FNA) significantly increased the ED50 on the ascending limb from 1.9  to 5.3 micrograms/infusion, and from 24.3 to 211.8 micrograms/infusion on the  descending limb. Administration of saline i.c.v. produced no effect on heroin  self-administration. Administration of 40 nmol of beta-FNA increased the ED50S  from 5.1 to 33.9 and from 14.4 to 502.8 micrograms/infusion on the ascending and  descending portions of heroin's dose-effect curve, respectively. beta-FNA (40  nmol, i.c.v.) had no effect on cocaine self-administration. [3H]DAMGO binding  density was decreased in the caudate and nucleus accumbens by 29 or 54% 24 h  after administration of 10 or 40 nmol of beta-FNA i.c.v., respectively. The  effects of beta-FNA on heroin self-administration were completely overcome by  increasing the dose of heroin however, as the shape and slope of the  self-administration dose-effect curve was not different when higher doses of  heroin were made available for self-administration compared to control data or  saline administration. Therefore, there appear to be spare mu-opioid receptors  for heroin for the production of its reinforcing effects in rats. Furthermore,  the self-administration dose-effect curves returned to control values prior to  the return of [3H]DAMGO binding, further suggesting that the full complement of  mu-opioid receptors is not necessary for heroin to produce its reinforcing  effects. These findings support the existence of spare mu-opioid receptors for  heroin in maintaining self-administration in rats.","1998-10-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","135-147","","2","52","","Drug Alcohol Depend","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Ireland PMID: 9800143","","","","Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Motivation; Radioligand Assay; Culture Techniques; Self Administration; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacokinetics; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Naltrexone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, mu/drug effects/physiology; Enkephalins/*pharmacokinetics; Cocaine/administration & dosage; Heroin/*administration & dosage; Brain/*drug effects/physiopathology; Heroin Dependence/*physiopathology; Caudate Nucleus/drug effects/physiopathology; Nucleus Accumbens/drug effects/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a large interindividual variation in the  enzyme activity of CYP2D6. The enzyme is largely non-inducible and metabolizes  approximately 25% of current drugs. Typical substrates for CYP2D6 are largely  lipophilic bases and include some antidepressants, antipsychotics,  antiarrhythmics, antiemetics, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and  opioids. The CYP2D6 activity ranges considerably within a population and includes  ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs), extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate  metabolizers (IMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs). There is a considerable  variability in the CYP2D6 allele distribution among different ethnic groups,  resulting in variable percentages of PMs, IMs, EMs and UMs in a given population.  To date, 74 allelic variants and a series of subvariants of the CYP2D6 gene have  been reported and the number of alleles is still growing. Among these are fully  functional alleles, alleles with reduced function and null (non-functional)  alleles, which convey a wide range of enzyme activity, from no activity to  ultrarapid metabolism of substrates. As a consequence, drug adverse effects or  lack of drug effect may occur if standard doses are applied. The alleles *10,  *17, *36 and *41 give rise to substrate-dependent decreased activity. Null  alleles of CYP2D6 do not encode a functional protein and there is no detectable  residual enzymatic activity. It is clear that alleles *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8,  *11, *12, *13, *14, *15, *16, *18, *19, *20, *21, *38, *40, *42, *44, *56 and *62  have no enzyme activity. They are responsible for the PM phenotype when present  in homozygous or compound heterozygous constellations. These alleles are of  clinical significance as they often cause altered drug clearance and drug  response. Among the most important variants are CYP2D6*2, *3, *4, *5, *10, *17  and *41. On the other hand, the CYP2D6 gene is subject to copy number variations  that are often associated with the UM phenotype. Marked decreases in drug  concentrations have been observed in UMs with tramadol, venlafaxine, morphine,  mirtazapine and metoprolol. The functional impact of CYP2D6 alleles may be  substrate-dependent. For example, CYP2D6*17 is generally considered as an allele  with reduced function, but it displays remarkable variability in its activity  towards substrates such as dextromethorphan, risperidone, codeine and  haloperidol. The clinical consequence of the CYP2D6 polymorphism can be either  occurrence of adverse drug reactions or altered drug response. Drugs that are  most affected by CYP2D6 polymorphisms are commonly those in which CYP2D6  represents a substantial metabolic pathway either in the activation to form  active metabolites or clearance of the agent. For example, encainide metabolites  are more potent than the parent drug and thus QRS prolongation is more apparent  in EMs than in PMs. In contrast, propafenone is a more potent beta-blocker than  its metabolites and the beta-blocking activity during propafenone therapy is more  prominent in PMs than EMs, as the parent drug accumulates in PMs. Since  flecainide is mainly eliminated through renal excretion, and both R- and  S-flecainide possess equivalent potency for sodium channel inhibition, the CYP2D6  phenotype has a minor impact on the response to flecainide. Since the  contribution of CYP2D6 is greater for metoprolol than for carvedilol, propranolol  and timolol, a stronger gene-dose effect is seen with this beta-blocker, while  such an effect is lesser or marginal in other beta-blockers. Concordant  genotype-phenotype correlation provides a basis for predicting the phenotype  based on genetic testing, which has the potential to achieve optimal  pharmacotherapy. However, genotype testing for CYP2D6 is not routinely performed  in clinical practice and there is uncertainty regarding genotype-phenotype,  gene-concentration and gene-dose relationships. Further prospective studies on  the clinical impact of CYP2D6-dependent metabolism of drugs are warranted in  large cohorts of subjects.","2009","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","689-723","","11","48","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 19817501","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Animals; Alleles; Pharmacogenetics; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/metabolism; *Polymorphism, Genetic; Biotransformation/genetics; Substrate Specificity/genetics; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/metabolism; Angina Pectoris/drug therapy; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/metabolism; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied whether intravenous S-ketamine alters the pharmacokinetics of  oral morphine in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this paired, randomized,  double-blind, crossover trial, 12 participants under a 2-hour intravenous  S-ketamine (0.57 mg/kg/h) or placebo infusion received oral morphine (0.2 mg/kg)  at 30 minutes. Plasma concentrations of ketamine, morphine, and their major  metabolites were quantified for 24 hours. The primary end point was area under  the curve (AUC)0-24 of morphine. Other pharmacokinetic variables for morphine and  its metabolites were studied as secondary end points. The data were analyzed as  between-phase comparisons for each participant using Wilcoxon matched-pairs  signed-rank tests (tmax) or paired t-tests on log-transformed variables (other  variables). RESULTS: While the AUC0-24 was similar between the 2 phases,  S-ketamine reduced the AUC0-1.5 of oral morphine by 69% (ratio to control, 0.31;  90% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.65; P = .0171) and increased its tmax from  0.5 (range, 0.50-1.5) to 1.0 hour (range, 0.50-4.0; P = .010). The AUC0-1.5 of  morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) was reduced by 84% (0.16; 90% CI, 0.07-0.37; P =  .0025) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 43% (0.57; 90% CI, 0.40-0.81; P  = .0155), while its tmax was increased from 1.5 (range, 1.0-2.0) to 4.0 (range,  1.0-8.0; P = .0094) hours by S-ketamine. Similarly, the AUC0-1.5 of  morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) was reduced by 85% (0.15; 90% CI, 0.05-0.43; P =  .0083), and tmax increased from 1.0 (range, 0.5-1.5) to 4.0 hours (range,  1.0-8.0; P = .0063). In addition, the M6G-to-morphine and M3G-to-morphine  metabolic AUC ratios were decreased by 47% (0.53; 90% CI, 0.39-0.71; P = .0033)  and 52% (0.48; 90% CI, 0.27-0.85; P = .0043) during 0 to 1.5 hours and by 15%  (0.85; 90% CI, 0.78-0.92; P = .0057) and 10% (0.90; 90% CI, 0.83-0.98; P = .0468)  during 0 to 24 hours, respectively. One participant was excluded from the  analyses due to vomiting in the S-ketamine phase. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous  S-ketamine inhibited the metabolism of oral morphine and delayed its absorption,  resulting in a net reduction in the exposure to morphine during the first 1.5  hours. Intravenous S-ketamine may delay the absorption and impair the efficacy of  orally administered analgesics and other drugs.","2023-09-21","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","","","","","","Anesth Analg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Two groups of parturients are constituted: group A 10  micrograms/kg alfentanil, group F 1 microgram/kg fentanyl. Pain is assessed with  a 0 to 10 points scale. There are no differences between the two groups for age,  weight, parity, term, initial cervical dilatation and new born weight. Analgesia  begins quickly in the two groups, and is more pronounced in the group A (than in  the group F (p less than 0.005). Analgesia is maintained for the whole dilatation  course. Pain scores increase during expulsion but are significantly lower than  the initial scores. No difference is noted as regards analgesia supplementation.  Obstetrical data: labour duration, oxytocin dosage, expulsion strength,  instrumental extraction rate and uterin evacuation are similar in the 2 groups.  No cesarean section is observed. Neonatal status, established according to Apgar  scores and then Amiel Tison neurological scales (0 to 30) respectively at 30 to  120 minutes are in the same favorable ranges: Apgar score is in all cases more  than 9. The neurological score is 24 (group A) and 22.9 (group F) at 30 minutes  and increases significantly at 120 minutes in the 2 groups (27 in the two  groups).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1989-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","95-100","","2","37","","Cah Anesthesiol","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 2567202","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Time Factors; Pregnancy; Alfentanil; *Analgesia, Epidural; *Analgesics, Opioid; *Anesthesia, Obstetrical; *Bupivacaine; *Fentanyl/*analogs & derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frail elderly patients often have multiple co-morbidities and  use multiple medicines, leading to an increased risk of clinically relevant  drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Age-related changes and increased  frailty may lead to a less predictable drug response, increased drug sensitivity,  and potential harmful drug effects. As a result, physicians face a complex task  in prescribing medication to elderly patients. In this review, the  appropriateness of the strong-acting opioids buprenorphine, fentanyl,  hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone and tapentadol is determined for  use in elderly patients. Evidence-based recommendations for prescribing strong  opioids to the frail elderly are presented. A literature search was performed for  all individual drugs, using a validated and published set of 23 criteria  concerning effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,  experience, and convenience in elderly patients. First, information on the  criteria was obtained from pharmaceutical reference books and a MEDLINE search.  The information obtained on the individual drugs in the class of opioids was  compared with the reference drug morphine. Evidence-based recommendations were  formulated on the basis of the pros and cons for the frail elderly. Using the set  of 23 criteria, no differentiation can be made between the appropriateness of  buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine and oxycodone for use in elderly  patients. Methadone has strong negative considerations in the treatment of  chronic pain in the frail elderly. Methadone has a high drug-drug interaction  potential and is associated with prolongation of the QT interval and a potential  risk of accumulation due to a long elimination half-life. In addition, methadone  is difficult to titrate because of its large inter-individual variability in  pharmacokinetics, particularly in the frail elderly. Because of a lack of empiric  knowledge, the use of tapentadol is not recommended in frail elderly persons.  Nevertheless, tapentadol may prove to be a useful analgesic for the treatment of  chronic pain in frail elderly persons because of its possible better  gastrointestinal tolerability. In the treatment of chronic pain in the frail  elderly, the opioids of first choice are buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone,  morphine and oxycodone. In order to improve the convenience for elderly patients,  the controlled-release oral dosage forms and transdermal formulations are  preferred.","2012-08-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","615-625","","8","29","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 22765848","","","","Humans; Aged; Drug Interactions; Evidence-Based Medicine/*methods; Contraindications; Frail Elderly; Chronic Pain/*drug therapy; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PARTICIPANTS: A task force of more than 40  experts in disciplines related to the use of analgesic and sedative agents in the  ICU was convened from the membership of the American College of Critical Care  Medicine (ACCM) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). EVIDENCE: The  task force members provided the personal experience and determined the published  literature (MEDLINE articles, textbooks, pharmacopeias, etc.) from which  consensus would be sought. Published literature was reviewed and classified into  one of four predetermined categories, according to study design and scientific  value. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The task force met several times as a whole, and  numerous times in smaller groups by teleconference, over a 1-yr period to  identify the pertinent literature and arrive at consensus recommendations for the  whole task force to discuss. Consideration was given to the relationship between  the weight of scientific information and the experts' viewpoints. Over the next  year, draft documents were composed by a task force steering committee and  debated by the task force members until consensus was reached by nominal group  process. The task force draft was then reviewed, assessed, and edited by the  Board of Regents of the ACCM. After steering committee approval, the draft  document was reviewed and approved by the SCCM Council. DATA SYNTHESIS: To  facilitate rapid communication of the six recommendations contained within the  complete and unabridged practice parameter document, an executive summary was  prepared for publication by the ACCM Board of Regents, and this executive summary  was approved by the task force steering committee and the SCCM Executive Council.  CONCLUSIONS: A consensus of experts provided six recommendations with supporting  data for intravenous analgesia and sedation in the ICU setting: a) morphine  sulfate is the preferred analgesic agent for critically ill patients; b) fentanyl  is the preferred analgesic agent for critically ill patients with hemodynamic  instability, for patients manifesting symptoms of histamine release with  morphine, or morphine allergy; c) hydromorphone can serve as an acceptable  alternative to morphine; d) midazolam or propofol are the preferred agents only  for the short-term (< 24 hrs) treatment of anxiety in the critically ill adult;  e) lorazepam is the preferred agent for the prolonged treatment of anxiety in the  critically ill adult; f) haloperidol is the preferred agent for the treatment of  delirium in the critically ill adult.

To assess their  antiopioid mechanism at postreceptor level, we observed the effects of the three  opioids and the two AOS on 45Ca uptake of the rat spinal synaptosomal  preparations. Morphine, Dyn A and DPDPE at concentrations of 10 nmol/L to 1  mumol/L, produced a mild suppression of 45Ca uptake of synaptosomal preparations  from ventral spinal cord. CCK-8 showed a mild suppression only at a concentration  of 1 mumol/L. In synaptosomes prepared from dorsal spinal cord, Dyn A but not  morphine or DPDPE, produced a strong inhibition of 45Ca uptake which was blocked  by nor-BNI, a kappa receptor antagonist, at 1 mumol/L. While CCK-8 (10 nmol/L to  1 mumol/L) also suppressed 45Ca uptake, it could antagonize the suppressive  effect induced by Dyn A. In contrast to CCK-8, AI (10 nmol/L to 1 mumol/L)  influenced neither on synaptosomal 45Ca uptake, nor on Dyn A suppression of 45Ca  uptake. The results presented above fit very well with our behavioral studies,  i.e., CCK-8 antagonized opioid analgesia in both the brain and the spinal cord,  whereas AI antagonized opioid analgesia in the brain but not in the spinal cord.  It is therefore concluded that antagonism of the opioid suppression of  synaptosomal 45Ca uptake might be one of the mechanisms for the antiopioid  activity of CCK-8 and AI.","1990-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","226-232","","3","42","","Sheng Li Xue Bao","","","","","","","","chi","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 1982024","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Calcium/*pharmacokinetics; Spinal Cord/*metabolism; Synaptosomes/*metabolism; Dynorphins/*pharmacology; Sincalide/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the authors aimed to propose dose-specific  concentration ranges in serum for oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl in patients  with chronic pain, based on concentration measurements from a large number of  patients and supported by theoretical pharmacokinetic calculations and previously  published concentrations. METHODS: The opioid concentrations in patients  undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for various indications (TDM group)  and patients with cancer (cancer group) were investigated. Patients were divided  based on the daily opioid doses, and the 10th and 90th percentiles of the  concentrations in each dose interval were evaluated. In addition, the expected  average serum concentrations were calculated for each dose interval based on  published pharmacokinetic data, and a targeted literature search for previously  reported dose-specific concentrations was performed. RESULTS: The opioid  concentrations in 1054 patient samples were included: 1004 in the TDM group and  50 in the cancer group. In total, 607 oxycodone, 246 morphine, and 248 fentanyl  samples were evaluated. The authors proposed dose-specific concentration ranges  based mainly on 10th-90th percentiles of the concentrations measured in patient  samples, whereas the calculated average concentrations and previously published  concentrations were used to adjust the ranges. In general, results from  calculations and concentrations retrieved from previous literature were within  the 10th-90th percentiles of concentrations from patient samples. However, the  lowest calculated average concentrations of fentanyl and morphine were below the  10th percentiles of patient samples in all dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed  dose-specific ranges may be useful for interpreting steady-state opioid serum  concentrations in clinical and forensic settings.","2023-06-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","","","","","","Ther Drug Monit","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Knowledge of previous work is required to decide if  gender-based differences in clinical is justified. Females have 20-30% greater  sensitivity to the muscle relaxant effects of vecuronium and rocuronium. When  rapid onset of or short duration of action is very important, gender-modified  dosing may be considered. Males are more sensitive than females to propofol. It  may therefore be necessary to decrease the propofol dose by 30-40% in males  compared with females in order to achieve similar recovery times. Females are  more sensitive than males to opioid receptor agonists, as shown for morphine as  well as for pentazocin. On the other hand, females may experience respiratory  depression and other adverse effects more easily if they are given the same doses  as males. These examples illustrate that gender should be taken into account as a  factor that may be predictive for the dosage of several anesthetic drugs.

However, the  development of many has suffered due to their poor pharmacokinetic properties  and/or rapid metabolism. Our recent efforts to identify MOR modulators have  provided  17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14β-dihydroxy-4,5α-epoxy-6α-(isoquinoline-3-carboxamido)morphinan  (NAQ), a low-efficacy partial agonist, that showed sub-nanomolar binding affinity  to the MOR (K (i) 0.6 nM) with selectivity over the delta opioid receptor (δ/μ  241) and the kappa opioid receptor (κ/μ 48). Its potent inhibition of the  analgesic effect of morphine (AD(50) 0.46 mg/kg) and precipitation of  significantly less withdrawal symptoms even at 100-fold greater dose than  naloxone represents a promising molecule for further development as a novel OUD  therapeutic agent. Therefore, further in vitro and in vivo characterization of  its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties was conducted to fully  understand its pharmaceutical profile. NAQ showed favorable in vitro ADMET  properties and no off-target binding to several classes of GPCRs, enzymes, and  ion channels. Following intravenous administration, 1 mg/kg dose of NAQ showed a  similar in vivo pharmacokinetic profile to naloxone; however, orally administered  10 mg/kg NAQ demonstrated significantly improved oral bioavailability over both  naloxone and naltrexone. Abuse liability assessment of NAQ in rats demonstrated  that NAQ functioned as a less potent reinforcer than heroin. Chronic 5 day NAQ  pretreatment decreased heroin self-administration in a heroin-vs-food choice  procedure similar to the clinically used MOR partial agonist buprenorphine. Taken  together, these studies provide evidence supporting NAQ as a promising lead to  develop novel OUD therapeutics.","2022-11-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1197-1209","","11","5","","ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 American Chemical Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36407950  PMCID: PMC9667545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of these compounds--tofisopam (Grandaxin), girisopam,  nerisopam--exert significant anxiolytic and antipsychotic activities. Sites where  actions of 2,3-benzodiazepines are mediated differ from those of  1,4-benzodiazepines. Binding of 2,3-benzodiazepines to neuronal cells in the  central nervous system shows a unique and specific distribution pattern: their  binding sites are located exclusively to the basal ganglia. Chemical lesioning of  the striato-pallido-nigral system, surgical transections of the striato nigral  pathway and the activation of c-fos expression in the basal ganglia after  application of 2,3-benzodiazepines suggest that these compounds mainly bind to  projecting neurons of the striatum. The binding sites are transported from the  striatum to the substantia nigra and the entopeduncular nucleus. Recent studies  on mechanism of action of 2,3-benzodiazepines indicate their possible role in  opioid signal transduction since 2,3-benzodiazepines augment the agonist potency  of morphine to induce catalepsy and analgesia, and their action is diminished in  morphine tolerant animals. The possible biochemical target of 2,3-benzodiazepines  is an alteration in the phosphorylation of protein(s) important in the signal  transduction process. Agents affecting emotional responses evoked by endogenous  opioids without danger of tolerance and dependence may represent a new  therapeutic tool in the treatment of addiction and affective disorders.","2000-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","309-342","","4","60","","Prog Neurobiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10670703","","","","Humans; Animals; Anti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*pharmacokinetics; Basal Ganglia/*drug effects; Benzodiazepines/*pharmacokinetics; Binding Sites/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enterohepatic recirculation prolongs  drug half-lives and may be associated with the generation of 1 or more secondary  plasma peaks. For EHRC to occur, there is substantial dependence on the flora  residing in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The role of gut microflora is so  essential to our overall homeostasis that it is referred to by some authorities  as an endocrine organ or ""a second brain."" Hepatic metabolism plays the dominant  role in the fate of drugs and other xenobiotics that we encounter. The liver is  rich in a host of chemical manipulators that can hydrolyze, reduce, oxidize, and  conjugate xenobiotics. Many drugs, morphine being a good example, are inactivated  by glucuronide or sulfate conjugation, with subsequent movement into the bile and  eventual emptying into the GI tract. Once in the GI tract, enzymes produced by  gut flora can hydrolyze conjugated drugs in the small and large intestine,  resulting in the active form reemerging, with reabsorption likely. The clinical  relevance of EHRC is discussed with its major implications for efficacy and  safety.","2020-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","71-76","","1","88","","AANA J","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32008621","","","","Humans; Enterohepatic Circulation; Bile; Liver/*metabolism; Bile/*metabolism; hepatic metabolism; Perioperative Period; *Anesthesia, General; Nurse Anesthetists; Anesthetics/*pharmacokinetics; enterohepatic recirculation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theoretical aspects and criteria for practical use].","Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion","","0034-9356","","","Spinal opiates were introduced for use in obstetrics during the 1980's. The possibility of achieving analgesic effects with small doses, without motor and/or  vegetative involvement, initially aroused a great deal of enthusiasm. After  extensive experience using these drugs, however, it seems they only partially  live up to these great expectations. Savings on dose seem to be attained only  with morphine and the efficacy of spinal opiates used as the only agents against  pain during childbirth is limited. Intradural administration is often accompanied  by vegetative involvement, and the reduction in motor blockade generally does not  have substantial effect on the progression of labor. On the other hand, it is  important to underline the advantages of combining opiates with local anesthesia:  both doses are reduced, quality of analgesia is greater, as is maternal  satisfaction, and fetal/neonatal repercussions are scarce. Finally, in certain  cases, opiates may constitute a valid alternative for local anesthesia,  especially if delivery is intradural. The use of spinal opiates is certainly an  important qualitative advance, though not a definitive one, in obstetrics.","1995-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","369-377","","9","42","","Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 8584773","","","","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Injections, Spinal; Clinical Protocols; *Analgesia, Obstetrical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investigations  into opioid pharmacokinetics provide crucial information regarding both on- and  off-target drug effects. Our recent work showed that morphine deposits and  accumulates in the mouse retina at higher concentrations than in the brain upon  chronic systemic exposure. We also found reduced retinal expression of  P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a major opioid extruder at the blood-brain barrier (BBB).  Here, we systematically interrogated the expression of three putative opioid  transporters at the blood-retina barrier (BRB): P-gp, breast cancer resistance  protein (Bcrp) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (Mrp2). Using  immunohistochemistry, we found robust expression of P-gp and Bcrp, but not Mrp2,  at the inner BRB of the mouse retina. Previous studies have suggested that P-gp  expression may be regulated by sex hormones. However, upon acute morphine  treatment we found no sex differences in morphine deposition levels in the retina  or brain, nor on transporter expression in the retinas of males and females with  a high or low estrogen:progesterone ratio. Importantly, we found that P-gp, but  not Bcrp, expression significantly correlated with morphine concentration in the  retina, suggesting P-gp is the predominant opioid transporter at the BRB. In  addition, fluorescence extravasation studies revealed that chronic morphine  treatment did not alter the permeability of either the BBB or BRB. Together,  these data suggest that reduced P-gp expression mediates retinal morphine  accumulation upon systemic delivery, and in turn, potential effects on circadian  photoentrainment.","2023","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1206104","","","14","","Front Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Berezin, Bergum, Torres Lopez and Vigh.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37388441  PMCID: PMC10301758","","","","P-glycoprotein; ABC transporters; blood-brain barrier; morphine; sex differences; blood-retina barrier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alfentanil is mainly used intraoperatively. In minor operations, its intravenous  application is sufficient for anaesthesia. In major operations, the need for  other anaesthetics can be reduced by the application of alfentanil. The best form  of application is the computer-controlled infusion of alfentanil. The advantage  of alfentanil over other opioids is the short recovery time of the patient.  Alfentanil can also be used postoperatively for pain relief. Used intravenously  after abdominal operations, it is approximately ten times more effective than  morphine. Applied peridurally its analgesic effect corresponds approximately to  that of morphine. Based on the lower amount of alfentanil needed, the  patient-controlled application of alfentanil is superior to the use of constant  infusion rates. In combination with midazolam, alfentanil can also be used for  analgosedation of intensive care patients.

A lack of information regarding methadone's  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships has contributed to limitation in  its use in analgesic treatments. However, it has been recently re-evaluated in  light of better knowledge of its pharmacological characteristics and wider  experience. Concern about the safety of methadone therapy arising because of its  long and unpredictable half-life should not deter clinicians from its appropriate  use. Methadone is a very useful drug in cancer pain because of its low cost, lack  of known metabolites, high oral bioavailability, rapid onset and time to peak  analgesic effect, and the long duration of activity which allows for longer  intervals between doses. Moreover, methadone has been demonstrated to have a high  receptor reserve and to exert some NMDA receptor antagonist effect. A shift from  one opioid to methadone is recommended when the side-effect/analgesic balance is  unfavourable, as symmetrical patterns of cross-tolerance of opioid agonists have  been demonstrated. Different approaches, including the oral PCA, have been  proposed to circumvent problems related to its pharmacokinetic properties.","1997","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","77-83; discussion 84-85","","2","1","","Eur J Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15102407","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A DNA fragment was amplified by  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate primers designed to two highly  conserved domains found in other aromatic amino acid decarboxylases. A poppy  seedling cDNA library was screened with this PCR product and a cDNA (cTYDC1) for  tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase (TYDC/DODC) was isolated. Two other independent cDNAs  (cTYDC2 and cTYDC3) encoding TYDC/DODC were isolated by heterologous screening  with a plant tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) cDNA as probe. A poppy genomic  library was screened with cTYDC1 and two intronless genomic clones (gTYDC1 and  gTYDC4) were isolated. The deduced amino acid sequences of all poppy clones share  extensive identity with other reported pyridoxal phosphate-dependent  decarboxylases from both plants and animals. Based on sequence homology, members  of the gene family were divided into two subsets (cTYDC1 and gTYDC4; cTYDC2 and  cTYDC3) of proteins with predicted M(r) = 56,983 and 59,323, respectively. Within  each subset the clones exhibit greater than 90% identity, whereas clones between  subsets share less than 75% identity. Expression of gTYDC1 and cTYDC2 as  beta-galactosidase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli resulted in catalytically  active enzymes immunodetectable with TDC-specific polyclonal antibodies. Each  enzyme showed marginally higher substrate specificity for L-dopa over L-tyrosine,  but did not accept L-tryptophan and L-phenylalanine as substrates.

Both compounds showed low  (microM) affinity for alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Given BU224's ability to cross the  blood brain barrier, we predict that its in vivo effects are likely to be  mediated via I2 receptors.

The impact  of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the clearance of and response to a series of  cardiovascular drugs was addressed. Since CYP2D6 plays a major role in the  metabolism of a large number of other drugs, Part II of the article highlights  the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the response to other groups of clinically  used drugs. Although clinical studies have observed a gene-dose effect for some  tricyclic antidepressants, it is difficult to establish clear relationships of  their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic parameters to genetic variations of  CYP2D6; therefore, dosage adjustment based on the CYP2D6 phenotype cannot be  recommended at present. There is initial evidence for a gene-dose effect on  commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but data on the  effect of the CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype on the response to SSRIs and their  adverse effects are scanty. Therefore, recommendations for dose adjustment of  prescribed SSRIs based on the CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype may be premature. A  number of clinical studies have indicated that there are significant  relationships between the CYP2D6 genotype and steady-state concentrations of  perphenazine, zuclopenthixol, risperidone and haloperidol. However, findings on  the relationships between the CYP2D6 genotype and parkinsonism or tardive  dyskinesia treatment with traditional antipsychotics are conflicting, probably  because of small sample size, inclusion of antipsychotics with variable CYP2D6  metabolism, and co-medication. CYP2D6 phenotyping and genotyping appear to be  useful in predicting steady-state concentrations of some classical antipsychotic  drugs, but their usefulness in predicting clinical effects must be explored.  Therapeutic drug monitoring has been strongly recommended for many  antipsychotics, including haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine,  perphenazine, risperidone and thioridazine, which are all metabolized by CYP2D6.  It is possible to merge therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing  for CYP2D6 into clinical practice. There is a clear gene-dose effect on the  formation of O-demethylated metabolites from multiple opioids, but the clinical  significance of this may be minimal, as the analgesic effect is not altered in  poor metabolizers (PMs). Genetically caused inactivity of CYP2D6 renders codeine  ineffective owing to lack of morphine formation, decreases the efficacy of  tramadol owing to reduced formation of the active O-desmethyl-tramadol and  reduces the clearance of methadone. Genetically precipitated drug interactions  might render a standard opioid dose toxic. Because of the important role of  CYP2D6 in tamoxifen metabolism and activation, PMs are likely to exhibit  therapeutic failure, and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) are likely to experience  adverse effects and toxicities. There is a clear gene-concentration effect for  the formation of endoxifen and 4-OH-tamoxifen. Tamoxifen-treated cancer patients  carrying CYP2D6*4, *5, *10, or *41 associated with significantly decreased  formation of antiestrogenic metabolites had significantly more recurrences of  breast cancer and shorter relapse-free periods. Many studies have identified the  genetic CYP2D6 status as an independent predictor of the outcome of tamoxifen  treatment in women with breast cancer, but others have not observed this  relationship. Thus, more favourable tamoxifen treatment seems to be feasible  through a priori genetic assessment of CYP2D6, and proper dose adjustment may be  needed when the CYP2D6 genotype is determined in a patient. Dolasetron,  ondansetron and tropisetron, all in part metabolized by CYP2D6, are less  effective in UMs than in other patients. Overall, there is a strong  gene-concentration relationship only for tropisetron. CYP2D6 genotype screening  prior to antiemetic treatment may allow for modification of antiemetic dosing. An  alternative is to use a serotonin agent that is metabolized independently of  CYP2D6, such as granisetron, which would obviate the need for genotyping and may  lead to an improved drug response. To date, the functional impact of most CYP2D6  alleles has not been systematically assessed for most clinically important drugs  that are mainly metabolized by CYP2D6, though some initial evidence has been  identified for a very limited number of drugs. The majority of reported in vivo  pharmacogenetic data on CYP2D6 are from single-dose and steady-state  pharmacokinetic studies of a small number of drugs. Pharmacodynamic data on  CYP2D6 polymorphisms are scanty for most drug studies. Given that genotype  testing for CYP2D6 is not routinely performed in clinical practice and there is  uncertainty regarding genotype-phenotype, gene-concentration and gene-dose  relationships, further prospective studies on the clinical impact of  CYP2D6-dependent metabolism of drugs are warranted in large cohorts.","2009","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","761-804","","12","48","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 19902987","","","","Humans; Phenotype; Animals; Genotype; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/metabolism; Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics; Polymorphism, Genetic/*physiology; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Antiemetics/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Histamine Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Muscarinic Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Psychotropic Drugs/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nalbuphine  unique pharmacology is an advantage in pain management. It is µ antagonist,  partial κ agonist for G-proteins and beta-arrestin-2. Benefits are related to  G-protein interactions resulting in less nausea, pruritus, and respiratory  depression than morphine. At low doses, nalbuphine reduces side effects  particularly respiratory depression without loss of analgesia when combined with  potent opioids. Nalbuphine pharmacokinetics are moderately altered in renal  failure. Several studies have found that nalbuphine reduces uremic pruritus.  Nalbuphine has drawbacks: it is not an oral formulation, it causes withdrawal in  patients on sustained released opioids, and it cannot be used to treat an opioid  withdrawal syndrome. Nalbuphine, despite being a µ receptor antagonist produces a  drug-liking effect and can be abused. There are very few deaths associated with  nalbuphine alone in part due to the fact it is rarely used but also related to a  ceiling on respiratory depression.","2018-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","143-151","","2","14","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29733100","","","","Humans; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Patient Selection; Clinical Decision-Making; Pain Measurement; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Pain Management/adverse effects/*methods; Nalbuphine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Pain/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The six female rats that acquired and maintained the morphine  discrimination did so in significantly fewer sessions than the eight males did  (28 +/- 5 vs 51 +/- 9 sessions, respectively), and the ED(50) for morphine  substitution was significantly lower in females (0.69 +/- 0.15 vs 1.28 +/-  0.20mg/kg). The time course of morphine substitution was approximately equivalent  in females and males. The µ agonist fentanyl completely substituted for morphine  in both sexes, with no sex difference in potency to substitute for morphine. The  µ agonist buprenorphine partially or completely substituted for morphine in all  females and five of six males, but at a lower dose in females (ED(50) 0.009 +/-  0.002 vs 0.019 +/- 0.006mg/kg). The delta agonist BW373U86 partially substituted  for morphine in both sexes, with no potency differences; the kappa agonist  U69,593 and the non-opioid cocaine did not substitute for morphine in either sex.  On a test of spontaneous locomotor activity, morphine increased locomotion to a  slightly but not significantly greater extent in males than in females. Morphine  also produced significantly greater hotplate antinociception in males than in  females. Further drug discrimination training with a lower dose of morphine,  1.0mg/kg, decreased the ED(50) for morphine substitution in females and males to  0.26 +/- 0.06 vs 0.45 +/- 0.11mg/kg, respectively (not significant). In a  separate group of age-matched rats, there was no sex difference in brain or  plasma levels of morphine measured via HPLC 20min post-injection, the  pretreatment time used to examine behavioral effects of morphine. The HPLC  results, plus the fact that sex differences were not the same for all behavioral  effects of morphine, suggest that sex differences in discriminative stimulus  effects of morphine are not due to differential pharmacokinetics. The possibility  that sex differences in morphine discrimination reflect sex differences in opioid  receptor pharmacology, or differential reinforcement between morphine and saline  levers for males but not females, is discussed.","1996-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","764-778","","8","7","","Behav Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11224471","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therapeutic hypothermia dramatically  improves the incidence of intact survival, but does not eliminate adverse  outcomes. The ideal provision of sedation and treatment of seizures during  therapeutic hypothermia represent therapeutic targets requiring optimization in  practice. Physiologic stress from therapeutic hypothermia may obviate some of the  benefits of this therapy. Morphine is commonly utilized to provide comfort,  despite limited empiric evidence supporting safety and efficacy. Dexmedetomidine  represents an interesting alternative, with preclinical data suggesting direct  efficacy against shivering during induced hypothermia and neuroprotection in the  setting of HIE. Pharmacokinetic properties must be considered when utilizing  either agent, with safety dependent on conservative dosing and careful  monitoring. HIE is the leading cause of neonatal seizures. Traditional therapies,  including phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, and benzodiazepines, control seizures in  the vast majority of neonates. Concerns about the acute and long-term effects of  these agents have led to the exploration of alternative anticonvulsants,  including levetiracetam. Unfortunately, levetiracetam is inferior to  phenobarbital as first-line therapy for neonatal seizures.

For the past years, since the discovery of spinal opioid receptors, the use  of spinal opioids has been adopted in clinical practice in the hope of producing  intense segmental analgesia that was devoid of the dose-limiting side effects  associated with systemic opioid administration. Experimental studies have  demonstrated that after their perispinal administration, liposolubility is  inversely proportional to their spinal selectivity, which is higher for the most  water-soluble drug, morphine, than for other more lipophilic drugs, such as  fentanyl and sufentanil. Clinical trials have shown that epidural morphine in the  form of extended-release liposome injections gives good analgesia for a period of  48 hours, with no need for epidural catheterization. Conversely, fentanyl is the  most appropriate opioid in ambulatory surgery and seems to have the strongest  effect at the spinal cord administered epidurally as a bolus and supraspinally  using continuous epidural infusion. Epidural methadone and hydromorphone are  suitable alternatives for analgesia in the postoperative period, given that they  have intermediate pharmacokinetic characteristics with respect to the two  aforementioned groups of opioids. All opioids administered intrathecally will  produce some degree of spinally mediated analgesia. The main differences are  related to their duration of action, rate of clearance, and the pathways by which  the drugs reach their receptors in the brain.

Analgesics,  sedatives, vagolytics, and/or muscle relaxants have the potential to blunt these  adverse effects, reduce the duration of the procedure, and minimize the number of  attempts necessary to intubate the neonate. The medical care team must understand  efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data for individual medications to select  the optimal cocktail for each clinical situation. Although many units utilize  morphine for analgesia, remifentanil has a superior pharmacokinetic profile and  efficacy data. Because of hypotensive effects in preterm neonates, sedation with  midazolam should be restricted to near-term and term neonates. A vagolytic,  generally atropine, blunts bradycardia induced by vagal stimulation. A muscle  relaxant improves procedural success when utilized by experienced practitioners;  succinylcholine has an optimal pharmacokinetic profile, but potentially  concerning adverse effects; rocuronium may be the agent of choice based on more  robust safety data despite a relatively prolonged duration of action. In the  absence of an absolute contraindication, neonates should receive analgesia with  consideration of sedation, a vagolytic, and a muscle relaxant before endotracheal  intubation. Neonatal units must develop protocols for premedication and optimize  logistics to ensure safe and timely administration of appropriate agents.","2018-07","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","238-247","","4","37","","Neonatal Netw","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30567922","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; pharmacology; Infant, Newborn; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Infant, Premature; Analgesics/*therapeutic use; Hypnotics and Sedatives/*therapeutic use; neonate; analgesia; Education, Nursing, Continuing; sedation; endotracheal intubation; Intensive Care, Neonatal/methods/*standards; Intubation, Intratracheal/methods/*standards; muscle relaxant; Neonatal Nursing/*education/*standards; Nurses, Neonatal/education; Premedication/methods/*standards; vagolytic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is no ideal opioid available  for epidural use. Comparative pharmacokinetic data help selection of the  appropriate epidural opioid. Morphine (provided it is given in small doses and  volumes) is very appropriate for epidural pain treatment, especially for longer  periods of treatment, due to the excellent analgesia and very low systemic  morphine concentrations. The faster onset of analgesia makes the epidural  application of pethidine, alfentanil and fentanyl recommendable. However, due to  the increased risk of respiratory depression during continuous treatment, these  opioids should not be given over longer treatment periods. Epidural  administration of methadon, sufentanil and buprenorphine cannot be recommended  since the advantages over systemic use do not outweigh the risks. Epidural  tramadol is useful in clinical routine if opioids are not available and  supervision of the patient is not guaranteed, because the opioid is not  restricted by law and has a low potential for central depressive effects.  Nalbuphine and butorphanol should not be selected for epidural use until the  benefit/risk ratio is defined. The safety of patients is paramount. If patients  are harmed by inappropriate opioids or dose regimens, this will unjustly  discredit a valuable treatment of postoperative pain.","1995","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","16-25","","1","20","","Anaesthesiol Reanim","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8526956","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Pain Measurement; Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects; Analgesia, Epidural/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No significant difference in the inhibition of EMV was observed  initially between the sciatic nerve and the ulnar nerve stimulated group after 2  mg of morphine, administered either extradurally or intravenously. However,  greater inhibition of EMV by the extradural morphine than by intravenous  administration of this drug was observed after 10 min in sciatic nerve stimulated  and after 20 min in the ulnar nerve stimulated group. With the extradural  administration of 0.05 mg fentanyl, EMV was inhibited more significantly in the  sciatic stimulated group than in the ulnar nerve stimulated group. Intravenous  administration of this drug failed to reveal any change in either sciatic nerve  stimulated or ulnar nerve stimulated group. When butorphanol 0.5 mg or  buprenorphine 0.05 mg was administered, no significant difference in the  inhibition of EMV was observed between the drugs, regardless of the routes of  administration or sites of stimulation. Extradural administration of ketamine 0.5  mg showed none of the inhibition of EMV in both the sciatic nerve stimulated, and  the ulnar nerve stimulated groups. These results indicate that various analgesics  administered into the extradural space produced characteristic actions depending  on the pharmacokinetic properties of each drug, locally and/or generally.

Potential P-gp inducers (rifampin and morphine) were administered  subchorionically to P-gp-competent [mdr1a(+/+)] mice to induce P-gp expression in  brain; the impact of rifampin pretreatment on brain penetration of verapamil also  was evaluated with an in situ brain perfusion technique. In addition, the effect  of single-dose rifampin on P-gp BBB transport activity was assessed with brain  perfusion using verapamil and quinidine as model P-gp substrates. Chronic  exposure to rifampin or morphine induced P-gp expression in mouse brain to a  modest extent. However, single-dose rifampin treatment increased the brain uptake  of verapamil and quinidine in mdr1a(+/+) mice in a dose- and  concentration-dependent manner, consistent with P-gp inhibition. Maximum  inhibition of P-gp-mediated efflux of verapamil by rifampin pretreatment in vivo  (150 mg/kg) was approximately 55%, whereas there was only approximately 12%  inhibition of P-gp-mediated efflux of quinidine at that rifampin dose.  Coperfusion of rifampin at a concentration of 500 microM abolished P-gp-mediated  efflux of verapamil at the BBB. However, only approximately 40% inhibition of  P-gp-mediated efflux of quinidine was observed with coperfusion of rifampin, even  at a 2-fold higher rifampin concentration (1000 microM). The present studies  demonstrate that P-gp function at the BBB can be modulated by rifampin in a dose-  and concentration-dependent manner. The degree to which rifampin inhibits  P-gp-mediated transport is dependent on the substrate molecule.","2003-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-12-11 05:39:20","","556-562","","2","306","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","tex.ids= Zong2003a PMID: 12721332 place: United States","","","","Animals; Mice; Perfusion; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Interactions; Verapamil/pharmacokinetics; Brain/metabolism; Biological Transport/drug effects; Rifampin/*pharmacology; Quinidine/pharmacokinetics; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology; Antibiotics, Antitubercular/pharmacology; Blood-Brain Barrier/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some metabolites such as  morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists. With  high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression. In  addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert  neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures. Few cases of respiratory depression  following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been  reported. The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged. Lastly, the  disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil  appears to be unaffected in renal failure. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis it  has been shown that oxidation of opioids is reduced, resulting in a decreased  drug clearance (meperidine, propoxyphene, pentazocine, tramadol and alfentanil)  and increased oral bioavailability due to reduced first-pass metabolism  (meperidine, propoxyphene, pentazocine, dihydrocodeine). Although glucuronidation  is thought to be less affected in liver cirrhosis, the clearance of morphine was  found to be decreased and its oral bioavailability increased. The consequence of  reduced drug metabolism is the risk of accumulation in the body, especially with  repeated administrations. As for patients with renal failure, special risks are  known for meperidine with potential accumulation of normeperidine, which can  cause seizures, and for propoxyphene for which several cases of hepatotoxicity  have been reported. On the other hand, the analgesic activity of codeine and  tilidine depends on transformation into the active metabolites, morphine and  nortilidine. In the case of reduced metabolism in chronic liver disease, the  analgesic action of these drugs may be compromised. Lastly, the disposition of a  few opioids, such as fentanyl, sufentanil, and remifentanil, appears to be  unaffected in liver disease.","1999-06-11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","183-195","","3","13","","Schmerz","","","","","","","","ger","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 12799931","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pain is one of the most common and feared symptoms in patients with  cancer with marked impact on quality of life. According to the WHO analgesic  ladder, opioids are the mainstay of cancer pain management, if well-accepted  guidelines are systematically applied. Oral morphine has been widely used in  treating cancer pain of moderate to severe intensity and remains the preferred  first choice to many clinicians for its familiarity/availability/costs. However,  a significant proportion of patients under oral morphine do not have successful  outcomes, often switched to alternative strong opioids. Opioid rotation is a  therapeutic maneuver aiming in improving analgesic response and/or reducing  adverse effects, including change to different medication using the same  administration route, maintaining the current medication but altering  administration route, or both. In this review, a detailed presentation of the  available literature, regarding opioid rotation strategy, up to now is performed.  Indications, principles, opioid dose-conversion recommendations, and guidelines  in oncology patients are presented. An outline of the evidence supporting the use  of this therapeutic modality on clinical benefit/outcome is attempted. Mechanisms  contributing to patients' variable opioid response are underlined. Since 1/3 of  population will die from cancer (80 percent with severe pain in their final year  of life) effective pain control remains an ongoing challenge. Opioid rotation may  be useful in opening the therapeutic window and establishing a more advantageous  analgesia/toxicity relationship. However, too much work is to be done to further  individualize analgesic therapy for patients with cancer.","2008-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","213-250","","4","4","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18837204","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Treatment Outcome; Drug Administration Schedule; Pharmacogenetics; Patient Selection; Drug Administration Routes; Pain Measurement; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Severity of Illness Index; Quality of Life; Drug Tolerance; Drug Dosage Calculations; Pain/*drug therapy/etiology; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  particular action mechanism makes NP a very difficult-to-treat condition,  resistant to most of the commonly used analgesic drugs. A recent study stated  that NP has an incidence of 1.24% over the general population, and this  percentage increases if we consider acute radiculopathies and some recurrent  neuropathies, frequently considered not only neuropathic pain but also  nociceptive. Thus, the improvement of NP treatment has become a public health  necessity. While WHO recommendations include a three-lined scale in pain  treatment -including NSAIDs as the first-line drugs, soft opioids (tramadol or  codein) as the second-line, and strong opioids (morphine, oxycodone, and  phentanyl) as the third-line- some studies have found this rationale not useful  in NP treatment. Based on several studies as STEP, Spanish Pain Society  recommendations included antidepressant and anticonvulsant drugs as the first  line treatment. Pregabalin, a new neuromodulators class drug, provides a  pharmacokinetic profile than its predecessors (phenytoin, carbamazepine,  gabapentin, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine), and showed effectiveness  controlling peripheral neuropathic pain. Thus, pregabalin opened the door to a  new approach to NP. Other pain societies, such as the Canada Pain Society, have  also included pregabalin in the first line treatment of NP. In fact, gabapentin  and pregabalin are the current standard care in most of NP-associated diseases.","2009-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","7-12","","","45 Suppl C","","Drugs Today (Barc)","","","","","","","","por","Copyright 2009 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

Fentanyl demonstrates pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic properties that are desirable in the management of acute pain,  and IN fentanyl may be of value in the prehospital setting. The aim of this  systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence for the use of IN fentanyl  in the emergency department (ED) and prehospital setting. METHOD: Reports of  trials of IN fentanyl in (ED) and prehospital treatment of pain were  systematically sought using the PubMed database, Embase, Google scholar, the  Cochrane database and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health  Literature. RESULTS: Twelve studies of IN fentanyl in the (ED) and prehospital  setting were included in the final analysis. In the ED, analgesic non-inferiority  and superiority were demonstrated when comparing IN fentanyl with intravenous  (IV) and intramuscular morphine, respectively. Non-blinded, non-controlled  studies demonstrated an analgesic effect of IN fentanyl in patients with moderate  and severe pain. In the prehospital setting, both analgesic inferiority and  non-inferiority were demonstrated when IN fentanyl was compared with IV morphine.  Finally, a significant analgesic effect of IN fentanyl was demonstrated when IN  fentanyl was compared with methoxyflurane. CONCLUSION: Only limited quality  evidence exists for the efficacy of IN fentanyl in the ED and in the prehospital  setting, and more double-blinded, randomised, controlled trials are urgently  needed to validate the use of IN fentanyl in this context.","2013-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","A4563","","1","60","","Dan Med J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Denmark PMID: 23340187","","","","Humans; Pain/*drug therapy; Administration, Intranasal; Emergency Service, Hospital; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage; Fentanyl/*administration & dosage; *Emergency Medical Services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(+) Tramadol and  the metabolite (+) -O- desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the mu opioid  receptor. (+) Tramadol also stimulates presinaptic release of serotonin and  inhibits serotonin reuptake whereas (-) tramadol inhibits norepinephrine  reuptake. Thus tramadol enhances inhibitory effects on pain transmission both by  opioid and monoaminergic mechanisms. The complementary and synergistic actions of  the two enantiomers improve the analgesic efficacy and tolerability profile of  the racemate. Following oral administration the bioavailability of tramadol is  high and with new slow release preparations twice daily administration enables  effective pain control. The recommended maximum daily dose of tramadol is 400  mg/day. Tramadol is characterised by low plasma protein binding and quite  extensive tissue distribution. Elimination is primarily by the hepatic route  (metabolism by CYP2D6) and partly by the renal route. It is effective in  different types of moderate-to-severe acute and chronic pain, including  neuropathic pain, low back pain, osteoarthritis pain and breakthrough pain. It  also causes fewer opioid-type adverse effects, e.g. nausea, drowsiness, vomiting,  dry mouth and constipation. Although trials in literature demonstrate  immune-stimulating effects of tramadol, there are also trials suggesting  immunesuppressive effects that are lesser than morphine. Owing to its  pharmacological properties, tramadol is more appropriate than NSAIDs for patients  suffering from gastrointestinal and renal problems. Besides its proven clinical  efficacy tramadol is a safe drug as respiratory depression, cardiovascular side  effects, drug abuse and dependence are of minor clinical relevance, unlike some  other opioids.","2006-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","5-19","","1","18","","Agri","","","","","","","","tur","","","","","","","Place: Turkey PMID: 16783663","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Pain, Intractable/*prevention & control; Tramadol/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"R83VMAMP","journalArticle","1995","Barr, J.; Donner, A.","Optimal intravenous dosing strategies for sedatives and analgesics in the intensive care unit.","Critical care clinics","","0749-0704","","","Achieving and maintaining adequate levels of analgesia and sedation in critically ill patients is a fundamental part of ICU care. Understanding the clinical  pharmacology of commonly used sedative agents (e.g., midazolam, lorazepam, and  propofol) and opioids (e.g., fentanyl and morphine) enables clinicians to best  dose these drugs to the desired clinical effect while minimizing the risk of  excessive sedation and cardiopulmonary depression. This has significant safety  and cost implications for patient care in the ICU. Simulations of plasma  concentrations of these medications when administered to ICU patients provide  useful insight into the clinical pharmacology of these agents. A number of points  should be made with regards to the interpretation of these predicted plasma  concentrations, however. First, it is important to remember that PK parameters  for most of these agents, with the exception of midazolam and propofol, were  derived from bolus or short-term infusions administered to healthy patients, and  that the PK parameters for lorazepam, fentanyl, and morphine when administered as  long-term infusions to critically ill patients may vary dramatically from these  initial estimates. Specifically, their volumes of distribution and elimination  half-lives may prove to be significantly larger and longer, respectively, when  administered to patients in the ICU. This pharmacokinetic variability may result  in even longer emergence times than predicted herein following discontinuation of  continuous infusions of these agents. Until similar studies in ICU patients are  performed for lorazepam, fentanyl, and morphine, the clinical pharmacology of  these agents in ICU patients remains uncertain. Additionally, midazolam and  morphine both have active metabolites that can accumulate in critically ill  patients receiving long-term infusions. These metabolites add significantly to  the sedative effects of the primary compound. Other drugs with sedative effects  given concurrently with any of these agents (i.e., psychotropic agents, epidural  opioids, etc.) may also contribute to the sedative effects of these drugs. These  studies do not account for the development of tolerance (which can occur with  both benzodiazepines and opioids) or changing kinetic profiles within an  individual patient over time (i.e., due to changes in volume of distribution,  protein binding, or clearance). Finally, there is a high degree of interpatient  variability among critically ill patients, and medication dosing must be tailored  to individual patients' needs (i.e., one dose does not fit all patients). Given  the uncertainty of resulting plasma concentrations with long-term administration  of these medications, the best ways to achieve and maintain optimal levels of  sedation and analgesia while minimizing the risk of oversedation and side effects  are to (1) initiate sedation in an incremental fashion until the desired level of  sedation is achieved, then periodically (i.e., once a day) titrate the infusion  rate of sedative-hypnotics and opioids downward until the patient begins to  emerge from the sedative effects of these drugs; and finally gradually increase  the infusion rate until the desired level of sedation is once again achieved; and  (2) consider the use of a sedation scale to standardize the level of sedation to  be maintained (see Table 3). The use of such a scale enables physicians to  communicate to nursing staff the specific level of sedation to be achieved and  maintained in an individual patient (i.e., titrate the midazolam infusion between  0 to 5 mg/hr to maintain a sedation score of 2-3; call MD for inadequate  sedation, respiratory depression, or hypotension). Achieving optimal sedation and  analgesia of patients in the ICU requires not only that the choice of  medication(s) be appropriate for the clinical setting but also that there are  specific clinical endpoints for the agents used (i.e., light versus deep  sedation, continuous versus intermittent sedation, sedation with","1995-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","827-847","","4","11","","Crit Care Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8535981","","","","Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Drug Monitoring/*methods; *Narcotics; Critical Care; Nursing Assessment; *Hypnotics and Sedatives; *Benzodiazepines; *Propofol; Conscious Sedation/adverse effects/*methods; Neurologic Examination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the operation, patient-controlled analgesia with morphine was  administered and the total dose used over 24 hours recorded. Visual analog pain  scale (VAS: 0 = no pain, 10 cm = worst pain) was measured at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and  12 hours after the operation. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant  difference between the two groups in sensory or motor block characteristics.  There was a significantly lower VAS score among the patients with fentanyl added  to their blocks within the first hour after the operation (1.3 +/- 1.5 cm versus  3.8 +/- 3.1 cm; P < .05), but subsequent VAS scores and total 24-hour  patient-controlled analgesia requirements were no different. CONCLUSIONS: Adding  fentanyl 75 micrograms to mepivacaine supraclavicular blocks has no significant  effects on block characteristics. It may enhance postoperative analgesia, but the  duration of this effect is too brief to be clinically useful.","1995-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","311-315","","4","20","","Reg Anesth","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7577779","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Double-Blind Method; Injections; Pain Measurement; Injections, Intramuscular; Anesthesia; Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Fentanyl/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; *Nerve Block; Brachial Plexus; Mepivacaine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Valdecoxib  1.25 to 10mg twice daily and valdecoxib 10mg once daily were more effective than  placebo for the relief of pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, and  dosages above 5mg twice daily were similar in efficacy to naproxen 500mg twice  daily. Similarly, valdecoxib 5 and 10 mg/day were as effective for osteoarthritis  of the hip as naproxen 500mg twice daily. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis,  valdecoxib 10, 20 or 40 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo, and  similar in efficacy to naproxen 500mg twice daily; there were no significant  differences in efficacy between the three dosages of valdecoxib. Valdecoxib 20 or  40mg administered 1 to 3 hours before and 12, 24 and 36 hours after hip  arthroplasty provided significantly better analgesia than placebo, and  significantly reduced the amount of morphine taken by patients. Single doses of  valdecoxib 10 to 80mg administered before foot or oral surgery provided  significantly better analgesia than placebo; when administered after oral  surgery, valdecoxib 20 or 40mg provided greater sustained analgesia than  oxycodone 10mg/paracetamol 1000mg or rofecoxib 50mg.

"7Q96VJ2R","journalArticle","2008","Smith, Howard S.","Variations in opioid responsiveness.","Pain physician","","1533-3159","","","It has been appreciated for some time now that humans react differently to opioids. A specific opioid such as morphine sulfate may have specific analgesic  effects for certain patients with postherpetic neuralgia whereas in other  patients with postherpetic neuralgia, it may provide quite different analgesic  qualities. Also, in any one individual patient a particular opioid may provide  better analgesia than other opioids. Furthermore, these differences are not  unique to analgesia; they can also be seen with other opioid effects/toxicities.  Though many of the differences can be classified neatly into pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic differences, there are certain differences which still remain  incompletely understood. Also, clinicians are not yet able to easily predict  which patients will respond well or poorly to various opioids. As research  unravel the various genetics, biochemical, and receptor interaction differences  of opioids in humans, it is hoped that easily obtainable, cost-effective testing  will become available to aid clinicians in choosing an optimal opioid analgesic  for an individual patient, a process which is currently accomplished via health  care provider judgment along with trial and error. In the future, knowledge  gained from databases on knockout rodents, pharmacogenetics, and gene  polymorphisms may impact on the ability of clinicians to predict patient  responses to doses of specific opioids in efforts to individualize optimal opioid  analgesic therapy. It is conceivable that eventually information of this type may  translate into improved patient care. In the future, armed with data of this  type, clinicians may become quite adept at tailoring appropriate opioid therapy  as well as optimal opioid rotation strategies.","2008-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","237-248","","2","11","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18354715","","","","Humans; Animals; Pain/*drug therapy; Drug Tolerance; Analgesia, Patient-Controlled; *Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These cells are coupled by gap junctions (GJ) into a syncytial-like  network resulting in cellular communication through ionic and metabolic exchange  between adjacent astrocytes. Whether anesthetics affect astrocyte function is not  known. In the present study, the effects of general anesthetics on GJ  permeability were investigated in primary cultures of mouse striatal astrocytes.  METHODS: Junctional permeability was determined by using the fluorescent probe  Lucifer yellow and the scrape loading/dye transfer technique. Confluent cells  were preincubated 5 min with various concentrations of anesthetic agents and GJ  permeability was estimated by measuring the area occupied by the dye from  digitalized images taken 8 min after cell loading. RESULTS: Of the intravenous  anesthetics tested, only propofol (P: 10(-4) M, P < 0.01 and 10(-5) M, P < 0.05)  and etomidate (ET: 10(-4) M, P < 0.05, but not 10(-5) M) induced a significant  reduction of GJ permeability. In contrast, diazepam (10(-5) M), morphine (10(-4)  M), ketamine (10(-4) M), thiopental (10(-4) M), and clonidine (10(-7) M) did not  affect junctional permeability. In addition, the halogenated anesthetics  halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane induced a dose-dependent closure of GJ. For  halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane, the maximum effect was achieved with a  10(-4) M, 1.6 x 10(-3) M, and 10(-3) M anesthetic concentration, respectively.  Removal of volatile anesthetics resulted in the restoration of the control  fluorescence area between 15 and 45 min. The time course of recovery of GJ  permeability was examined more precisely for shorter periods of halothane  administration (5 min, 1 mM). Under these conditions, the rate of dye spread  returned to control values following anesthetic washout, while, during the same  period of time, complete uncoupling of GJ was still observed in the presence of a  1 mM halothane concentration. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that general  anesthetics differentially affect GJ permeability in cultured astrocytes. This  uncoupling effect (closure of gap junctions) may contribute to the mechanisms of  action of some anesthetic agents (primarily volatile anesthetics) at the level of  the CNS by altering astrocyte communication.","1993-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","892-901","","5","78","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7683851","","","","Animals; Mice; Fluorescent Dyes; Cells, Cultured; Isoquinolines; Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects; Cell Communication/drug effects; Dextrans; Rhodamines; Anesthetics/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Astrocytes/*drug effects; Etomidate/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Propofol/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J.","The Use of Miscellaneous Prescription Medications to Facilitate Sexual Assault.","Forensic science review","","1042-7201","","","Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults are typically those that rapidly render the potential victim unconscious or sedated, and produce memory loss or amnesia.  Many of these drugs are difficult to detect due to a delay in biological specimen  collection. Detection is further hampered as the drugs are often administered in  single low doses and are rapidly and extensively metabolized, resulting in low  concentrations in biological specimens. Miscellaneous prescription drugs such as  the barbiturates, antipsychotics, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, ketamine,  and chloral hydrate have the potential to produce varying degrees of sedation;  however, they are not frequently detected in drug-facilitated sexual assault  cases. A review of the literature shows that these drugs are often knowingly  taken by the victim before or subsequent to the assault, and therefore may  contribute to the sedation or unconsciousness experienced by the victim when  ethanol or other central nervous system drugs are co-administered. Most  barbiturates, opioids, and tricyclic antidepressants are routinely screened for  in hospitals and forensic toxicology laboratories, and may be detectable in a  urine specimen for several days. Antipsychotics, particularly the atypical class,  ketamine, and chloral hydrate, generally require more targeted analyses.

E.","Drug disposition and effects in the fetus.","Journal of developmental physiology","","0141-9846","","","Surveys of drug use in pregnancy demonstrate that a significant proportion of human fetuses are exposed to prescription and non-prescription drugs antenatally  or during labor, although recently a decrease in licit drug consumption during  pregnancy may have occurred. However, legitimate medical reasons for drug therapy  of the mother or fetus remain and there is an increasing problem with illicit  drugs. Several approaches are used to examine placental transfer of and fetal  exposure to drugs, including studies on pregnant women, the use of chronically  catheterized pregnant animals (particularly sheep), acute studies on small  animals (e.g. guinea pig and rabbit) and the use of the perfused placenta. Fetal  drug exposure is affected by large number of maternal, placental and fetal  factors. For long term maternal drug administration, drug binding in maternal and  fetal plasma, and fetal drug elimination seem particularly important. Thus, the  rate of non-placental clearance of morphine, methadone, acetamionophen,  metoclopramide, ritodrine and diphenhydramine in the fetal lamb is comparable to  that in the ewe, although the routes of fetal elimination are not fully  elucidated. The fetal liver may be of lesser importance in overall drug  elimination than in the adult, but conjugated drug metabolites in the fetus may  persist because of limited placental transfer. Hence, we have observed that the  glucuronide conjugate of ritodrine accumulates in amniotic fluid after  intravenous ritodrine administration. Accumulation of intact drugs in amniotic  fluid also occurs via fetal renal excretion and perhaps via the fetal membranes.  Also, a number of basic amine drugs are also concentrated in fetal tracheal  fluid, probably as a consequence of pulmonary uptake, which also takes place in  the adult. However, this could result in high fetal lung levels of agents, such  as beta 2-adrenergic agonists, that have potent effects on pulmonary function and  maturation. When digoxin, metoclopramide and diphenhydramine are injected into  amniotic fluid, they are preferentially distributed to the fetus and, for the  latter 2 drugs, uptake by the chorioallantoic membranes appears to be important.  Thus, there is the possibility of recycling of drugs from amniotic fluid to the  fetal circulation and their persistence in the fetus. Many of the therapeutic  agents given to pregnant women in late pregnancy have effects on fetal CNS,  cardiovascular or metabolic functions. Alterations in fetal behaviour are  elicited by prescription sedatives and anesthetics and illicit drugs, and also by  the antihistamine, diphenhydramine, present in various nonprescription  medications.","1991-01","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","33-44","","1","15","","J Dev Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1678754","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Adrenergic beta-Agonists/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Fetus/drug effects/*metabolism; Histamine Antagonists/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Illicit Drugs/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Pregnancy/drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several factors influence the amount of pain  patients experience postoperatively, studies have identified genetic variations  that influence pain perception and response to pain medications. The purpose of  this article is to examine evidence of the genetic differences that affect  patients' responses to medications frequently used in postoperative pain  management. Genes of interest associated with postoperative pain management  include the opioid µ1 receptor (OPRM1), cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, catechol  O-methyl transferase (COMT) enzyme, and adenosine triphosphate-binding cascade  (ABCB1) transporter. There is moderate evidence linking the OPRM1 sequence  variation and response to morphine in the postoperative period. Besides activity  at the OPRM1 receptor, analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pain medications  also depend on their rate of metabolism by CYP enzymes. CYP2D6 enzymes metabolize  codeine and tramadol. Codeine and tramadol are not recommended in CYP2D6 poor  metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers and are contraindicated in children and  breastfeeding mothers. Similarly, caution must be exercised when using  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in CYP2C9 intermediate metabolizers and poor  metabolizers.

In traditional opioid  receptor binding assays in mouse brain homogenates, both endomorphin-1 and  endomorphin-2 competed both mu1 and mu2 receptor sites quite potently. Neither  compound had appreciable affinity for either delta or kappa1 receptors,  confirming an earlier report. However, the two endomorphins displayed reasonable  affinities for kappa3 binding sites, with Ki values between 20 and 30 nM. Both  endomorphins competed 3H-[D-Ala2, MePhe4,Gly(ol)5] enkephalin binding to MOR-1  receptors expressed in CHO cells with high affinity. In mouse brain homogenates  125I-endomorphin-1 and 125I-endomorphin-2 binding was selectively competed by mu  ligands. 125I-Endomorphin-1 and 125I-endomorphin-2 also labeled MOR-1 receptors  expressed in CHO cells with high affinity. Autoradiography of the two  125I-labeled endomorphins demonstrated regional patterns in the brain similar to  those previously observed for mu drugs. Pharmacologically, the endomorphins were  potent analgesics. Although they were equipotent supraspinally, endomorphin-1 was  more potent spinally. Endomorphin analgesia was effectively blocked by naloxone,  as well as the mu-selective antagonists beta-funaltrexamine and naloxonazine. In  CXBK mice, which are insensitive to supraspinal morphine, neither endomorphin was  active, consistent with a mu mechanism of action. Finally, the endomorphins  inhibited gastrointestinal transit. In conclusion, these results support the mu  selectivity of these agents.","1998-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1007-1013","","2","286","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9694962","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Autoradiography; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Injections, Intraventricular; Iodine Radioisotopes; Pain Measurement/drug effects; Gastrointestinal Transit; Membranes/drug effects/metabolism; Oligopeptides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Brain/*drug effects; Receptors, Opioid, mu/agonists/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The author conducted an extensive review  of the existing medical literature on opioid agents and formulations currently  available. RESULTS: Opioids remain the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for cancer  pain. In addition to severity of pain, coexisting disease, response to previous  therapy, the drug's pharmacokinetics and available formulations influence the  choice of an opioid agent. Short-half-life drugs, such as morphine,  hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and oxymorphone, are generally favored  initially because they are easier to titrate than long-half-life agents.  Long-acting controlled-release opioid preparations can lessen the inconvenience  of around-the-clock administration of drugs with a short duration of action. In  recent years several new formulations have been developed, including  controlled-release morphine suppositories and suspensions; controlled-release  tablets of oxycodone, hydromorphone, and codeine; and transdermal fentanyl, a  patch that allows 3-day dosing and avoids the first-pass effect of the liver.  Most patients who receive controlled-release opioids should be provided with a  rescue dose of an immediate-release opioid to treat pain that may break through  the controlled-release schedule. CONCLUSIONS: Among the important advances in the  last decade in the treatment of chronic pain is the realization that the goals of  care and the best means of achieving them differ not only among individuals but  often for a single patient throughout a long course of care. Physicians must not  only be knowledgeable but also flexible in their approach to managing cancer  pain. An understanding of the range of opioid agents and the formulations  available can allow physicians to maintain the best possible quality of life for  their patients with chronic pain.","2000-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","8-15","","1","9","","J Oncol Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10787576","","","","Humans; Drug Administration Routes; Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use; Pain/*drug therapy/etiology; Neoplasms/*complications; Pain, Intractable/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent work has shown that human 125I-IL-1 alpha can enter the brain from  the blood by a saturable system, suggesting a mechanism that may directly link  the immune and nervous systems. Here, it is shown that radioiodinated murine IL-1  beta and especially murine IL-1 alpha are even more rapidly transported into the  brain of the mouse than is radioiodinated human IL-1 alpha after i.v. injection.  All three cytokines exhibited self-inhibition, thus demonstrating saturable  transport. Also, they all cross-inhibited the transport of each other. This shows  that there are not three separate transport systems, but that they either share  transport systems with overlapping affinities or share a single system. It was  calculated that 0.06% to 0.08% of the dose of human 125I-IL-1 alpha injected i.v.  was present in the brain during the first 60 min. By contrast, no saturable  component could be detected in the brain to blood passage of the three ILs. No  disruption of the blood-brain barrier to radioactively labeled albumin was found  with i.v. doses of up to 50 micrograms/kg of human IL-1 alpha. Additional studies  on the blood to brain transport of human 125I-IL-1 alpha showed no modification  by dexamethasone, morphine, indomethacin or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone.

The search for safe analgesics with  less harm potential has been decades long. However, clinical trials for safe  opioid and nonopioid analgesics have relied on subjective pain reports, which are  biased by placebo effects that increase the complexity of trials to develop new  therapies to manage pain. Research in opioid naïve animals and humans  demonstrates that blood concentrations of opioids that effectively saturate the  morphine opioid receptor are tightly linked with patient reports and quantitative  sensory tests for analgesia. Opioid drug concentrations can predict clinical  responses. This report reviews preclinical and clinical evidence correlating  buprenorphine pharmacokinetics with analgesia. More than 30 years of data confirm  buprenorphine blood concentrations can be an objective biomarker of analgesia for  moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.","2021","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","15-20","","7","17","","J Opioid Manag","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34520022","","","","Humans; Biomarkers; *Analgesia; Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects; Pain, Postoperative/diagnosis/drug therapy; *Buprenorphine/adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was designed to  determine whether esmolol affects the volatile anesthetic (isoflurane) required  to prevent movement to skin incision in 50% patients (minimum alveolar anesthetic  concentration [MAC]) with or without an additional opioid (alfentanil). One  hundred consenting adult patients were randomly divided into five treatment  groups: isoflurane alone (I), I with continuous large-dose (250 microg x kg(-1) x  min(-1)) esmolol (E), I with alfentanil (effect site target of 50 ng/mL) via a  continuous computer-controlled infusion (A), A plus continuous small-dose (50  microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) esmolol (A1), or A plus large-dose esmolol (A2).  Anesthesia was induced via a face mask, and steady-state target end-tidal  isoflurane concentrations were maintained before incision. The MAC of isoflurane  alone was 1.28% +/- 0.13%. Large-dose esmolol did not significantly alter the  isoflurane MAC (1.23% +/- 0.14%). Alfentanil alone significantly decreased  isoflurane MAC by 25% (0.96% +/-0.09%). Adding small-dose esmolol did not further  decrease MAC with alfentanil (0.96% +/- 0.13%). However, large-dose esmolol  significantly decreased isoflurane MAC with alfentanil (0.74% +/- 0.09%). Esmolol  and alfentanil both significantly reduced the increases in heart rate and mean  arterial pressure associated with endotracheal intubation and incision. The  mechanism of this effect is unknown. IMPLICATIONS: Most anesthetic techniques  rely on a balance of several highly selective medications.

METHOD: A postal  survey questionnaire was sent to 409 ICUs in Great Britain. RESULTS: Two hundred  thirty-eight completed questionnaires were returned and analysed. Most ICUs were  anaesthetist-led (85.8%) with only five ICUs being staffed by full-time  intensivists. Facilitation of mechanical ventilation and increased intracranial  pressure were the main indications for the prolonged use of neuromuscular  blockade. Atracurium and vecuronium (83%) were administered most commonly by  bolus alone (13.8%), bolus followed by continuous infusion (23.9%) or continuous  infusion only (60.9%). The most frequently cited criteria for the use of either  vecuronium or stracurium were their pharmacokinetics and haemodynamic stability.  Neuromuscular block was most commonly monitored clinically (91.7%), with only  8.3% of the responders using a peripheral nerve stimulator. All responders  indicated the concomitant use of sedatives (propofol/midazolam alone or in  combination in 89.4% of responders) and/or opioids (morphine, fentanyl or  alfentanil in 74.8% of respondents) with muscle relaxants. CONCLUSION: Most  responders agreed that while neuromuscular block in the ICU population may  provide advantages, it cannot be considered benign. Indeed, a great majority  consider that NMB agents should be used only as a last option and -for as short a  period as possible.","1996-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","862-866","","9","22","","Intensive Care Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8905418","","","","Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Patient Selection; Drug Therapy, Combination; United Kingdom; Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data; Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use; Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data; Drug Utilization; Hypnotics and Sedatives/therapeutic use; Neuromuscular Blocking Agents/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

D.","New advances in anesthesia.","The Nursing clinics of North America","","0029-6465","","","Pharmacologic advances in anesthesia over the last decade have focused on drug safety, shorter durations of action, reversibility, and ease of administration.  This is reflective of major changes in the focus of patient care from inpatient  to outpatient settings as well as from available risk management data that  support the investigation of these new drugs. The pharmacologic advances  discussed included those drugs in current practice as well as experimental drugs  yet to be released for general clinical use. Inhaled agents, such as isoflurane  and perhaps the experimental agent, desflurane, will maintain or achieve their  popularity because of the relative ease of administration and wide margins of  safety. Propofol, the most recent intravenous anesthetic available for clinical  use, has already gained wide acceptance because of its dual function as an  induction and maintenance agent and its appropriateness for use in the ambulatory  surgical population. The role of midazolam in anesthesia practice has increased  to such an extent that it has largely supplanted the use of diazepam (Valium).  The introduction of the antagonist, flumazenil, will undoubtedly enhance the  safety and efficacy of midazolam as well as broaden its applicability of use  across various patient populations. Several of the newer synthetic narcotics,  such as alfentanil and sufentanil, have replaced other narcotics formerly used in  anesthesia practice, such as meperidine and morphine, primarily because of their  short action and lack of significant side effects. The use of muscle relaxants as  a critical component of anesthetic management has led to the development of a  number of new drugs in this classification. Pharmacologic management of patients  under anesthesia will at some future date likely include the administration of  alpha 2 agonists. Administration of these drugs can reduce anesthetic  requirements of traditional agents by as much as 50%. As research continues, new  drugs will be incorporated into the practice of anesthesia, ones that will  promote rapid uptake, low toxicity, intense analgesia, easy reversibility,  shorter durations, and fewer side effects. One measure of success relative to  pharmacologic development in anesthesia is the recent and dramatic decreases in  patient morbidity and mortality figures over the last decade. This attests to the  rapid growth and development of not only improved patient monitoring systems but  also newly improved ""agents of sleep.""","1991-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","451-461","","2","26","","Nurs Clin North Am","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2047291","","","","Humans; Anesthesia, Intravenous/methods/*trends; Anesthesia, Inhalation/methods/*trends; Anesthesia/*trends; Clonidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Narcotics/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Neuromuscular Blocking Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A member of the seven-transmembrane domain (TM) G  protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, the mu-opioid receptor modulates ion  channels and second messenger effectors in an opioid agonist-dependent fashion  that is reversible by the classic opiate antagonist naloxone. Mutation of a  histidine residue (His297) in TM 6 afforded agonist-like G protein-coupled signal  transduction mediated by naloxone and other alkaloid antagonists and enhanced the  intrinsic activity of documented alkaloid partial agonists, including  buprenorphine. The intrinsic activities of all opioid peptide agonists and  antagonists tested were not altered at the His297 mutant receptors. Consistent  with a role for the TM 6 histidine in maintaining high affinity binding sites for  opioid agonists and antagonists, opioid ligand-dependent protection of this  residue from a histidine-specific alkylating agent indicated that the His297 side  chain is positioned in or very near the binding cavity. The TM 6 His297 mutants  identify a discrete region of the receptor critical for determining whether a  specific drug pharmacophore triggers receptor activation. Because many GPCRs  possess a similarly positioned TM histidine residue, our findings with the  mu-opioid receptor may extend to these receptors and potentially serve as a model  for rational design of therapeutic GPCR partial agonists and antagonists.","1997-12","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","983-992","","6","52","","Mol Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9415708","","","","Animals; Rats; Tritium; Binding Sites; Xenopus laevis; Mutation; Binding, Competitive; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacology; Narcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology; Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; Naloxone/*pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, mu/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism; Alkaloids/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; COS Cells/metabolism/physiology; Enkephalins/metabolism/pharmacology; GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism/physiology; Histidine/*metabolism; Narcotics/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Opioid Peptides/metabolism/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An individual's genetic information  may eventually help diagnosis and treatment, as well selecting optimal  pharmacologic agents based partly on how well they reach their target, how well  they will bind to and produce an effect at their targets, how well they will be  metabolized, and the profile of their adverse effects. It also appears that  clinicians may be able to utilize an individual's genetic information to  ascertain a subject's risk or susceptibility of developing a particular medical  condition. Although, this has not been widely utilized in pain medicine at this  point, the future may revolutionize the role of genetic information in the  evaluation and management of various pain conditions. One reason for variations  in therapeutic outcomes from different pharmacologic pain treatments is the  different genetic disposition of patient to develop pain or to respond to  analgesics. The patient's phenotype may represent a conglomerate of several  different genetic variants concomitantly present in an individual. Genetic  variants may modulate the risk of developing a painful condition, or may modulate  the perception of pain (e.g. OPRM1 or GCH1 variants conferring modest  ""protection"" from pain by increasing the tone of the endogenous opioid system or  decreasing nitric oxide formation). Other genetic polymorphisms may alter  pharmacokinetic mechanisms (e.g. CYP2D6 related prodrug activation of codeine to  morphine), alter pharmacodynamic mechanisms (e.g. opioid receptor mutations), or  alter other analgesic effects (e.g. diminished euphoric effects from opioids  potentially due to DRD2 polymorphisms decreasing the functioning of the  dopaminergic reward system). This article theorizes that genetic alterations  including functional polymorphisms of Nrf2 (a master regulator of the  transcription of multiple antioxidants) may render certain subjects more or less  susceptible to developing complex regional pain syndrome after surgery or trauma.  If this hypothesis is correct, knowing this information may translate into  significant and ""far-reaching"" effects on clinical decision-making surrounding  the management of pain in patients who may be more susceptible to develop complex  regional pain syndrome. Furthermore, it could lead to the development of novel  prevention or intervention strategies, in efforts to prevent, abort, or  ameliorate the development of and/or effectively treat complex regional pain  syndrome.","2010-02","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","79-90","","1","13","","Pain Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20119466","","","","Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Animals; Genetic Variation/genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics; Oxidative Stress/*genetics; Antioxidants/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Complex Regional Pain Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology; Genome, Human/*genetics; NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"MCAWFIRN","book","2012","","Opioids in Palliative Care: Safe and Effective Prescribing of Strong Opioids for Pain in Palliative Care of Adults","","","","","","The 2008 World Cancer Declaration included a target to make effective pain control more accessible. Several key documents highlight the importance of  effective pain control, including ‘Improving supportive and palliative care for  adults with cancer’ (NICE cancer service guidance 2004), ‘Control of pain in  adults with cancer’ (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline 106),  ‘A strategic direction for palliative care services in Wales’ (Welsh Assembly  Government 2005) and ‘End of life care strategy’ (Department of Health 2008).  Strong opioids, especially morphine, are the principal treatments for pain  related to advanced and progressive disease, and their use has increased  significantly in the primary care setting. However, the pharmacokinetics of the  various opioids are very different and there are marked differences in  bioavailability, metabolism and response among patients. A suitable opioid must  be selected for each patient and, because drug doses cannot be estimated or  calculated in advance, the dose must be individually titrated. Effective and safe  titration of opioids has a major impact on patient comfort. The World Health  Organization has produced a pain ladder for the relief of cancer pain; strong  opioids are represented on the third level of the three-step ladder. The  guideline will address first-line treatment with strong opioids for patients who  have been assessed as requiring pain relief at the third level of the WHO pain  ladder. It will not cover second-line treatment with strong opioids where a  change in strong opioid treatment is required because of inadequate pain control  or significant toxicity. A number of strong opioids are licensed in the UK.  However for pain relief in palliative care a relatively small number are commonly  used. This guideline has therefore looked at the following drugs: buprenorphine,  diamorphine, fentanyl, morphine and oxycodone. Misinterpretations and  misunderstanding have surrounded the use of strong opioids for decades, and these  are only slowly being resolved. Until recently, prescribing advice has been  varied and sometimes conflicting. These factors, along with the wide range of  formulations and preparations, have resulted in errors causing underdosing and  avoidable pain, or overdosing and distressing adverse effects. Despite repeated  warnings from regulatory agencies, these problems have led on occasion to patient  deaths, and resulted in doctors facing the General Medical Council or court  proceedings. Additional guidance, including advice on reducing dosing errors with  opioid medicines, patient safety incidents arising from medication errors  involving opioids and safer use of injectable medicines is available from the  National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). This guideline will clarify the clinical  pathway and help to improve pain management and patient safety. This guideline  will not cover care during the last days of life (for example, while on the  Liverpool Care Pathway).","2012-05","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cardiff (UK)","eng","Copyright 2012, © National Collaborating Centre for Cancer.","","","","","","Book Title: Opioids in Palliative Care: Safe and Effective Prescribing of Strong Opioids for Pain in Palliative Care of Adults PMID: 23285502","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PET  and SPECT have been used to help our understanding of many aspects of the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of abused drugs, and have made valuable  contributions in terms of drug mechanisms, drug interactions (e.g. cocaine and  alcohol) and drug toxicities. They have also been employed to study the acute  effects of drugs on populations of active drug abusers and of normal controls,  and to evaluate the neurochemical consequences of candidate therapies for drug  abuse. A particularly productive strategy has been the use of PET in conjunction  with neuropsychological testing of subjects, to allow correlation of imaging data  with uniquely human aspects of the effects of drugs, such as euphoria and  craving.","2005","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","3203-3219","","25","11","","Curr Pharm Des","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 16250850","","","","Humans; Nicotine/metabolism; *Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; *Positron-Emission Tomography; Alcoholism/diagnostic imaging; Brain/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Cocaine-Related Disorders/diagnostic imaging; Morphine Dependence/diagnostic imaging; Substance-Related Disorders/*diagnostic imaging; Tobacco Use Disorder/diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dapoxetine is  the D-enantiomer of LY 243917 and is 3.5 times more potent as a serotonin  reuptake inhibitor than the L-enantiomer. Dapoxetine was in phase I clinical  trials in the US with Eli Lilly as an antidepressant, but no recent development  has been reported for this indication. However, development is underway for the  treatment of premature ejaculation, with phase III trials for this indication  being completed in the US. The phase II trial for the treatment of premature  ejaculation was conducted by PPD GenuPro, a subsidiary of PPD, which was  established from a collaboration between Eli Lilly and PPD for the development of  drugs to treat genitourinary disorders. Both Lilly and PPD had an option to  re-license dapoxetine upon completion of phase II trials, but neither company  exercised its option, and the rights remained with PPD GenuPro. In December 2003,  PPD Inc. acquired from Eli Lilly and Co. the patents for dapoxetine for  development in the field of genitourinary disorders. As part of the transaction,  PPD and Lilly terminated their existing license agreement for dapoxetine. In  December 2000, PPD GenuPro granted an exclusive, worldwide license for dapoxetine  to ALZA Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. ALZA will be  responsible for development, manufacturing and commercialisation of dapoxetine  for urological indications, including premature ejaculation. It will make  initial, milestone and royalty payments to PPD GenuPro, a portion of which will  be paid to originator Eli Lilly. PPD Inc. received a milestone payment relating  to the ongoing development of dapoxetine for premature ejaculation in July 2003.  In December 2003, PPD and ALZA amended the dapoxetine license to allow PPD to  receive a fixed-sum cash payment apon NDA approval. In return for this, ALZA will  not have to make sales-based payments for a period of time following the approval  of dapoxetine. If dapoxetine is approved by the US FDA for premature ejaculation,  the drug will be marketed in the US by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. In  December 2004, ALZA Corporation submitted a new drug application to the FDA for  dapoxetine hydrochloride in the treatment of premature ejaculation. If approved  by the FDA, dapoxetine hydrochloride will be marketed in the US by Ortho-McNeil  Pharmaceutical, Inc. Johnson & Johnson plans to support the launch of dapoxetine  for premature ejaculation with a 'responsible' direct-to-consumer advertising  campaign. In May 2005, Johnson & Johnson presented data from two phase III trials  involving dapoxetine for the treatment of premature ejaculation, during the 100th  Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA-2005).  Results on drug interactions and pharmacodynamics of dapoxetine were also  presented during this meeting. Dapoxetine also appears to be a useful adjunct to  morphine, lowering the threshold for analgesia, although the compound itself has  negligible analgesic activity. In December 2003, PPD, Inc. acquired from Eli  Lilly and Company the patents for dapoxetine for development in the field of  genitourinary disorders. Under the terms of the agreement with Lilly, PPD will  pay Lilly 65 million US dollars in cash. PPD will also pay Lilly a royalty on net  sales of dapoxetine in excess of a certain threshold of annual net sales. As part  of the transaction, PPD and Lilly terminated their existing license agreement for  dapoxetine.","2005","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","307-311","","5","6","","Drugs R D","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 16128601","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Depression/*drug therapy; *Benzylamines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Naphthalenes/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their use is more or less widespread, but other drugs, such as  dexmedetomidine, have been and continue to be studied for application in such  patients. Dexmedetomidine, a compound derived from imidazole, has a high affinity  for the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor, on which it acts as a potent agonist. A large  number of laboratory and animal studies have been performed, as have clinical  trials enrolling healthy volunteers or patients with the aim of shedding shed  light on the main pharmacological features of dexmedetomidine. As a result,  dexmedetomidine is known to have sedative, hypnotic and analgesic properties. It  diminishes the need for other anesthetics and sympathicolytics, and it reduces  catecholamine release. Controlled clinical trials have looked at the use of  dexmedetomidine in patients who require sedation and analgesia in postoperative  intensive care units. Research shows that dexmedetomidine lowers the need both  for other sedatives, such as propofol or midazolam, and for analgesic morphine.  Moreover, its effect on ventilation is scarce. Dexmedetomidine is presently  distributed in the United States but not in the European Union.

Alfentanil is a derivative of fentanyl, with quicker onset than  that of fentanyl and with shorter duration and more intense vagomimetic  properties than those of fentanyl and sufentanil. It may cause less intense  respiratory depression than equianalgesic doses of fentanyl. Clinical trials  indicate that alfentanil can be used effectively as an analgesic, as an analgesic  supplement to anaesthesia, and as the major component of a general anaesthetic.  Its short duration of effect makes it attractive as an analgesic supplement for  short ambulatory surgical procedures. Sufentanil is a more potent and more  lipophilic analgesic than fentanyl. It would appear to maintain haemodynamic  stability during surgery better than other opioids. Epidural sufentanil produces  a rapid onset and good quality of analgesia. In addition, low doses administered  intravenously via a PCA pump seem to have a potential role for analgesia during  labour. Remifentanil is an opioid analgesic that is rapidly metabolized by  non-specific blood and tissue esterases. According to its unique pharmacokinetic  profile, remifentanil-based anaesthesia combines high-dosage opioid analgesia  intraoperatively with a rapid and predictable postoperative awakening, even after  long procedures. Its vagomimetic properties are especially pronounced in small  children, the elderly and hypovolaemic patients, and in these groups atropine  should be always given before remifentanil administration. Remifentanil also  minimises the adrenergic response to endotracheal intubation. Three mju  agonist-antagonists have been used for pain treatment: nalbuphine, butorphanol  and buprenorphine. They can be used in ambulatory settings. Nalbuphine can be  used parenterally. It reverses morphine-induced respiratory depression while  maintaining adequate analgesic effect. Buprenorphine can be given sublingually,  percutanenously, epidurally and parenterally. It is a potent analgesic,  recommended for strong postoperative pain. Butorphanol is a potent analgesic that  increases heart rate, arterial and pulmonary blood pressures and cardiac output.  It should be given carefully in patients with coronary disease.","2008-03","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","39-43","","1","40","","Anestezjol Intens Ter","","","","","","","","pol","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 19469098","","","","Humans; Aged; Analgesia/*methods; Sufentanil/*pharmacology; Piperidines/*pharmacology; Remifentanil; Pain/*prevention & control; Pain, Postoperative/prevention & control; Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology; Anesthesia, General/*methods; Nalbuphine/pharmacology; Butorphanol/pharmacology; Alfentanil/*pharmacology; Anesthetics, General/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current  antiplatelet drugs target different pathways of platelet activation and show  specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics, implicating  clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews  the role of platelets in hemostasis and cardiovascular thrombosis, and discusses  the key pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interactions and reversal strategies of  clinically used antiplatelet drugs. EXPERT OPINION: Antiplatelet therapies target  distinct pathways of platelet activation: thromboxane A(2) synthesis, adenosine  diphosphate-mediated signaling, integrin α(IIb)β(3) (GPIIb/IIIa),  thrombin-mediated platelet activation via the PAR1 receptor and  phosphodiesterases. Key clinical drug-drug interactions of antiplatelet agents  involve acetylsalicylic acid - ibuprofen, clopidogrel - omeprazole, and morphine  - oral P2Y(12) inhibitors, all of which lead to an attenuated antiplatelet  effect. Platelet function and genetic testing and the use of scores (ARC-HBR,  PRECISE-DAPT, ESC ischemic risk definition) may contribute to a more tailored  antiplatelet therapy. High on-treatment platelet reactivity presents a key  problem in the acute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A  treatment strategy involving early initiation of an intravenous antiplatelet  agent may be able to bridge the gap of insufficient platelet inhibition in high  ischemic risk patients with STEMI.","2022-10","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1177-1197","","10","15","","Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36065676","","","","Humans; Drug Therapy, Combination; Clopidogrel; pharmacodynamics; clopidogrel; aspirin; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effects; *ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction/drug therapy; *Thrombosis; acetylsalicylic acid; antiplatelet; bleeding; cangrelor; GPIIbIIIa; P2Y12; PAR1; Platelet; prasugrel; Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists; thrombosis; ticagrelor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Commonly used opioids in ICU include  morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil and remifentanil. The choice among opioid drugs  relies on their pharmacokinetics and their pharmacodynamic effects.  Cardiovascular stability observed with fentanyl and sufentanil indicates their  use in hemodynamically compromised patients. Short-acting remifentanil offers  several advantages in patients requiring prolonged infusions. The  organ-independent metabolism of this newer molecule may be valuable in patients  with multiple organ failure. The main indications for opioid analgesia and  sedation in ICU include: 1) Anxiety, pain and agitation: in turn, they can  increase cardiac workload, myocardial oxygen consumption and rate of  dysarrhythmias; 2) immediate postoperative period after major surgery; 3)  short-term invasive procedures. Potential advantages offered by opioids in the  ICU setting also include: a) Cardiac protection: in animal models, it has been  observed that delta-opiate receptor stimulation confers a preconditioning-like  protective effects against myocardial ischemia; b) Neuroprotection: recent  studies suggest that mu- and kappa-opiate receptors are involved in ischemic  preconditioning against seizures in the brain. During opioid therapy in the ICU,  drug tolerance and withdrawal symptoms should be anticipated and the dose  adjusted accordingly.","2001-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","332-337","","4","67","","Minerva Anestesiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 11376535","","","","Humans; Animals; Intensive Care Units; Ischemic Preconditioning; *Analgesia; Heart/*drug effects; Critical Care/*methods; *Analgesics, Opioid; Brain/*drug effects; Anxiety/drug therapy; Brain Diseases/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Esmolol produces competitive blockade of beta receptors in both animals and  humans. It does not possess membrane-stabilizing, intrinsic sympathomimetic, or  alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol is  similar to that of metoprolol. Esterase metabolism accounts for the rapid total  body clearance of 285 mL/kg/min and elimination half-life of 9.2 minutes. Its  rapid metabolism following continuous intravenous infusion results in the rapid  offset of pharmacologic effect after drug administration is discontinued. In  patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, esmolol produces rapid control  of heart rate in an average effective dosage range from 97.2 to 115.0  micrograms/kg/min and effects that are similar to propranolol. Esmolol is  effective and safe in managing tachycardia and hypertension during surgical  stress and may be useful in postoperative hypertension or elevated heart rates  during myocardial ischemia. Esmolol does not appear to interact with digoxin,  morphine, warfarin, or succinylcholine to any clinically important extent. The  most frequent adverse effects associated with esmolol infusion are hypotension  and phlebitis. Hypotension can be avoided by careful titration, and if  encountered, it can be rapidly resolved by dosage adjustment or discontinuation  of the infusion. The ultrashort half-life and duration of action of esmolol may  allow safer application of beta blockade in critically ill patients.","1986-04","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","288-303","","4","5","","Clin Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2871961","","","","Humans; Female; Kinetics; Postoperative Complications; Drug Interactions; Pregnancy; Chemistry; Chemical Phenomena; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Coronary Disease/drug therapy; Heart/drug effects; Hypertension/drug therapy; Myocardial Infarction/drug therapy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/drug therapy; Arrhythmias, Cardiac/drug therapy; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Lactation/drug effects; Propanolamines/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Tachycardia/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mice that had been  exposed to various doses of phenobarbital by intraperitoneal injection were  killed, and their tissues were fixed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH  7.4) containing paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. Thereafter, paraffin and  frozen sections were made and stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method  using antisera obtained from commercial sources and used for the immunochemical  assay of the blood level of phenobarbital in clinical medicine. A specific  positive reaction was observed solely in testing the intoxicated tissues, and  this reaction was inhibited when phenobarbital was added to the antisera. The  minimal sensitivity of the positive reaction, which can be discerned by observing  the stained slides macroscopically, was in the range of 10 mg/kg. Thus, the  diagnosis of phenobarbital intoxication in the forensic autopsy can be made by  immunohistochemistry. A positive reaction was found in various tissue cells,  including nerve cells, myelin sheaths, glia cells, hepatocytes, cells of the  alveolar and bronchial wall, epithelial cells of the distal part of the renal  tubules, and so forth. Endothelial cells of the capillaries in all tissues gave a  strong positive reaction. The immunocytochemical electron microscopy of the  hepatocytes revealed that the positive reaction in the cytoplasm was located  solely in the intraluminal space of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These  results indicate some interesting aspects of the pharmacokinetics of  phenobarbital in vivo. It is expected that the antisera, which are used widely  for the assay of the blood concentration of various drugs (phenobarbital,  amphetamines, morphine, and so forth), may be regarded as excellent reagents for  immunocytochemistry. This clearly indicates that morphological evidence in  toxicology, which had so far remained obscure, can be easily obtained by applying  these antisera against various drugs.","1987-09","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","1221-1234","","5","32","","J Forensic Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3312467","","","","Male; Animals; Mice; Brain Chemistry; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Liver/analysis; Kidney/analysis; Lung/analysis; Spleen/analysis; Phenobarbital/*analysis; Endoplasmic Reticulum/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"TAG26DLI","book","2016","","Palliative care for adults: strong opioids for pain relief","","978-1-4731-2035-8","","","","Pain is common in advanced and progressive disease. Up to two-thirds of people with cancer experience pain that needs a strong opioid. This proportion is  similar or higher in many other advanced and progressive conditions. Despite the  increased availability of strong opioids, published evidence suggests that pain  which results from advanced disease, especially cancer, remains under-treated.  Each year 300,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in the UK and it is estimated  that there are 900,000 people living with heart failure. Others live with chronic  illness such as kidney, liver and respiratory disease, and with neurodegenerative  conditions. Many people with these conditions will develop pain for which a  strong opioid may be needed. The 2008 World Cancer Declaration included a target  to make effective pain control more accessible. Several key documents highlight  the importance of effective pain control, including ‘Improving supportive and  palliative care for adults with cancer’ (NICE cancer service guidance 2004),  ‘Control of pain in adults with cancer’ (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines  Network guideline 106), ‘A strategic direction for palliative care services in  Wales’ (Welsh Assembly Government 2005) and ‘End of life care strategy’  (Department of Health 2008). Strong opioids, especially morphine, are the  principal treatments for pain related to advanced and progressive disease, and  their use has increased significantly in the primary care setting. However, the  pharmacokinetics of the various opioids are very different and there are marked  differences in bioavailability, metabolism and response among patients. A  suitable opioid must be selected for each patient and, because drug doses cannot  be estimated or calculated in advance, the dose must be individually titrated.  Effective and safe titration of opioids has a major impact on patient comfort.  The World Health Organization has produced a pain ladder for the relief of cancer  pain; strong opioids are represented on the third level of the three-step ladder.  The guideline will address first-line treatment with strong opioids for patients  who have been assessed as requiring pain relief at the third level of the WHO  pain ladder. It will not cover second-line treatment with strong opioids where a  change in strong opioid treatment is required because of inadequate pain control  or significant toxicity. A number of strong opioids are licensed in the UK.  However for pain relief in palliative care a relatively small number are commonly  used. This guideline has therefore looked at the following drugs: buprenorphine,  diamorphine, fentanyl, morphine and oxycodone. Misinterpretations and  misunderstanding have surrounded the use of strong opioids for decades, and these  are only slowly being resolved. Until recently, prescribing advice has been  varied and sometimes conflicting. These factors, along with the wide range of  formulations and preparations, have resulted in errors causing underdosing and  avoidable pain, or overdosing and distressing adverse effects. Despite repeated  warnings from regulatory agencies, these problems have led on occasion to patient  deaths, and resulted in doctors facing the General Medical Council or court  proceedings. Additional guidance, including advice on reducing dosing errors with  opioid medicines, patient safety incidents arising from medication errors  involving opioids and safer use of injectable medicines, is available from the  National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). This guideline will clarify the clinical  pathway and help to improve pain management and patient safety. This guideline  will not cover care during the last days of life. DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS: The  guideline assumes that prescribers will use a drug’s summary of product  characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. WHO THIS  GUIDELINE IS FOR: The target audience is non-specialist healthcare professionals  initiating strong opioids for pain in adults with advanced and progressive  disease. However, the guideline is likely to be of relevance to palliative care  specialists as well.","2016-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","London","eng","Copyright © NICE 2018.","","","","","","Book Title: Palliative care for adults: strong opioids for pain relief PMID: 32208569","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multimodal analgesia use has been shown to  provide superior analgesia with improved recovery and reduction of post-operative  morbidity in other orthopedic subspecialties, but has not been described with  pediatric patients undergoing spinal surgery. OBJECTIVE: We describe a novel,  pre-emptive, opioid-sparing pediatric pain medication protocol that is started  two days prior to surgery, in accordance with first-order pharmacokinetics, and  continued post-operatively until discharge with the goal of decreasing  post-operative pain, improving early mobilization, and ultimately decreasing the  patient's length of hospital stay. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 116 PSIF  cases from March 2014 to November 2017. Fifty-two patients received standard  analgesia before August 2016, and 64 patients after August 2016 received the  pre-emptive protocol consisting of a standardized combination of acetaminophen,  celecoxib, and gabapentin two days prior to surgery and continued during their  inpatient stay. Scheduled oxycodone and intravenous hydromorphone via patient  controlled analgesia (PCA) were given to both groups equally during the  post-operative hospital stay. We analyzed length of stay, total opioid  consumption, and maximum pain scores per day from surgical to discharge date.  RESULTS: 116 patients were included: 64 patients in the pre-emptive group and 52  patients in the standard group. Length of hospital stay significantly differed,  with means of 3.9 days in the pre-emptive group and 4.5 days in the standard  analgesia group (p<0.05). Patients in the pre-emptive group recorded  significantly lower maximal pain levels than those in the standard analgesia  group on post-operative days #1 (4.9 vs. 5.8, p=0.0196), #3 (4.4 vs. 6.1,  p=0.0006), and #4 (4.2 vs. 5.4, p=0.0393). Total post-operative morphine  equivalents taken did not significantly differ between the two groups.  CONCLUSION: This is a preliminary report demonstrating a significant decrease in  maximal pain score and length of stay following PSIF on a cohort of patients  receiving a novel pre-emptive opioid-sparing pain medication protocol based on  first order pharmacokinetics.

METHODS: Buccal swabs were collected  preoperatively from 107 patients. Pharmacogenetic testing was performed for  genetic variants on a panel of 16 genes, including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, OPRM1, and  CYP1A2, which affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs and many opioids. Patients were randomized to a control  group or custom group and blinded to their group. The control group was  prescribed oxycodone, tramadol, and celecoxib for postoperative pain management.  If any of those were not normally metabolized, they were not prescribed to the  patients in the custom group, who were given an alternative drug (hydromorphone  for narcotics, meloxicam for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Patients  recorded their pain level (0-10 numeric scale) and all medications taken daily  for the first 10 days following surgery. Medication was converted to milligram  morphine equivalents (MMEs). RESULTS: Genetic variations to medications in our  standard postoperative pain management protocol occurred in 24 of the 107  patients (22.4%). The 10-day MME consumed by patients in the control group with  genetic variants was 162.6 mg. Patients with variants who had custom  postoperative medication consumed only 86.7 MME in the same timeframe (P = .126).  The control group demonstrated a higher 10-day average pain level of 4.2 vs the  custom group pain level of only 3.1 (P < .05). CONCLUSION: With custom  postoperative pain prescriptions based on pharmacogenetic testing, patients were  able to achieve lower pain levels while reducing the consumption of pain  medication.","2022-06","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","S76-S81","","6S","37","","J Arthroplasty","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Notwithstanding, pain control immediately after surgery may be more  challenging and a barrier to same-day discharge. Intrarectal diazepam has been  used for acute and chronic pelvic pain and has a pharmacokinetic profile ideal  for intermittent use. However, its use has not been investigated after the  surgical intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of  diazepam rectal suppositories on early postoperative pain after hysterectomy and  vaginal reconstruction for pelvic organ prolapse. STUDY DESIGN: This was a  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing postoperative pain  scores after vaginal hysterectomy with native tissue prolapse repairs. Patients  were randomized to receive either an intrarectal 10-mg diazepam suppository or an  identical placebo. Moreover, the participants completed the questionnaires at  baseline, the morning of postoperative day 1, and 2 weeks after the operation.  Surveys included visual analog scales for pain, a validated Surgical Satisfaction  Questionnaire, and queries regarding medication side effects and postoperative  recovery. The primary outcome was pain scores based on a visual analog scale  approximately 3 hours after surgery. The secondary outcomes included total  morphine equivalents after surgery, patient satisfaction with pain control,  same-day discharge outcome, and overall satisfaction. The chi-square, Fisher  exact, and Mann-Whitney tests were used. Based on a 10-mm difference in  postoperative vaginal pain using the visual analog scale, sample size was  calculated to be 55 patients in each arm to achieve 80% power with an alpha  of.05. RESULTS: From February 2020 to August 2021, 130 participants were  randomized. Of those participants, 7 withdrew, and 123 were analyzed: 60 in the  diazepam group and 63 in the placebo group. The median age was 65 years  (interquartile range, 27-80), the median body mass index was 27.9 kg/m(2)  (interquartile range, 18.70-45.90), and 119 of 123 participants (96.7%) were  White. There was no difference in the baseline characteristics, prolapse stage,  or types of procedures performed between groups. Most participants had concurrent  uterosacral ligament suspension with anterior and posterior repairs. Of note, 50  of 123 participants (41%) had midurethral slings. Moreover, 61 of 123  participants (50%) were discharged on the day of surgery. There was no difference  in the primary outcome of vaginal pain 3.5 to 6.0 hours postoperatively (25 vs 21  mm; P=.285). In addition, the amount of rescue narcotics used in the immediate  postoperative period (19.0 vs 17.0 MME; P=.202) did not differ between groups. At  2-weeks postoperatively, patients in the placebo group reported higher  satisfaction with pain control in the hospital (31 vs 43 mm; P=.006) and pain  control at home (31 vs 42 mm; P=.022). No difference was noted between same-day  discharges and those who were admitted overnight. CONCLUSION: The placement of a  10-mg diazepam rectal suppository immediately after pelvic reconstructive surgery  did not improve pain or narcotic usage in the early postoperative period.  Although the placebo group reported slightly higher satisfaction with pain  control 2 weeks after surgery, overall pain levels were low. Therefore, we do not  believe that the addition of diazepam to the postoperative regimen is warranted.","2022-08","2023-11-15 10:28:11","2023-11-15 10:28:11","","302.e1-302.e9","","2","227","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Each patient simultaneously received a buccal tablet and an intramuscular injection, only one of which contained morphine sulphate (13.3 mg); the patients were randomly allocated to two equal groups so twenty patients received each active preparation. The two preparations produced a similar degree of postoperative analgesia, assessed by the mean reduction in pain score and the pain relief score. Peak plasma morphine concentrations were slightly lower after buccal than after intramuscular administration but they declined more slowly; consequently, the drug's bioavailability was 40-50% greater after buccal than after intramuscular administration. The adverse effects of buccal morphine were generally less than those of intramuscular morphine.","1985-01-12","2023-12-03 12:36:28","2023-12-04 05:22:15","","71-73","","8420","1","","Lancet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 2857025","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2857025","data:timecourse; species:human; priority:high; checked:DM","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Clinical Trials as Topic; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Random Allocation; Tablets; Injections, Intramuscular; Morphine; Cheek; Analgesia; Pain, Postoperative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across all studies the range of the ratios of metabolites to morphine was wide (0.001-504 for M3G:M, and 0-97 for M6G:M). Neonates produced morphine glucuronides at a lower rate than older children or adults. Metabolite ratios were higher in renal impairment. Routes of administration which avoided first pass metabolism (intravenous, transdermal, rectal, intramuscular, epidural and intrathecal) resulted in lower metabolite production than oral, buccal or sublingual. Metabolite production was similar for single and multiple dosing. There was no evidence of differences between methods of assay. There was a high correlation between the two glucuronide metabolites in spite of the different situations studied, supporting a single glucuronidating enzyme. Morphine was present in CSF at a fourfold higher concentration than the glucuronide metabolites.","1998-01","2023-12-11 13:25:19","2023-12-11 13:25:19","","43-53","","1","74","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9514559","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9514559","","Adult; Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Kidney Diseases; Child; Infant, Newborn; Aging; Drug Administration Routes; Analgesics, Opioid; Morphine; Morphine Derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were no differences in morphine, metabolite kinetics, or analgesic efficacy between equivalent doses of conventional or controlled-release formulations. The increase in morphine plasma concentration after a dose (1 hr for normal release, 2 hr for controlled release) was correlated significantly with the dose of morphine (r = 0.914, P < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in pain intensity (P < 0.05) and increase in pain relief (P < 0.001) after the dose of morphine administration, when compared with the predose score. One-half of the patients had mild and tolerable adverse effects. Patients were classified by mean pain relief between doses as having optimal, moderate, or poor pain control. No simple relationship was found between morphine plasma concentration and pain control. Morphine plus M6G concentrations in the ""optimal control"" group (751.2 +/- 194 nmol/L), however, were more than twice those found in the ""moderate control"" group (276.9 +/- 41.9 nmol/L) (P < 0.05), and no patient in the moderate control group had a morphine plus M6G concentration greater than 405 nmol/L. These results support the importance of M6G in morphine analgesia. For these hospitalized patients, there appeared to be a therapeutic range of morphine plus M6G plasma concentrations for optimal pain control with a lower limit of 400 nmol/L predose.","1996-02","2023-12-11 13:18:26","2023-12-11 13:20:27","","95-102","","2","11","","J Pain Symptom Manage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 8907140","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8907140","species:human; data:pharmacokinetics; priority:low; checked:DM; data:dose response","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Neoplasms; Pain; Morphine; Morphine Derivatives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
