The pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of 20 mg lisinopril and 0.25 mg digoxin, given alone and together, have been studied in 12 normal young male  volunteers. 2. Peak serum conc of lisinopril occurred at 6 to 8 h and were  slightly higher during combined treatment. Subsequent elimination proceeded  moderately rapidly in both cases, concn declining to approx. 25% of peak values  in 24 h. The AUC of lisinopril was similarly slightly higher during combined  treatment. 3. After lisinopril alone, urinary elimination of unchanged lisinopril  was 13% dose in 72 h, and after combined therapy was 17% dose. 4. Although there  were no statistically significant differences in lisinopril pharmacokinetics  during single or combined treatment, serum and urinary parameters suggest that  bioavailability may be enhanced slightly during combined treatment. 5.

Lisinopril (5 mg day-1) was  administered for 7 days. Plasma lisinopril concentration was measured at 1, 2, 4,  6, 8 and 24 h on days 1 and 7 of the study. The two elderly groups had higher  serum lisinopril concentrations than the healthy young subjects (P less than  0.05). There were no significant differences in any of the areas under the curve  (AUC) for lisinopril plasma concentration (over time) between the healthy young  and healthy elderly groups. The healthy young patients had AUC values on day 7  lower than elderly patients with cardiac failure (P less than 0.01). Creatinine  clearance was correlated with lisinopril clearance (r = 0.63; P = 0.006) and with  AUC on day 7 (r = -0.67; P = 0.004). Lisinopril clearance was different in the  three groups (P less than 0.05): healthy young patients had the highest and  elderly patients with cardiac failure the lowest values. Thus, in the elderly a  reduced renal clearance of lisinopril leads to higher and more sustained blood  levels. In elderly patients with cardiac failure, renal function should be  estimated before lisinopril is prescribed as a reduction in dose may be  appropriate.","1987-11","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:24:10","","929-931","","11","39","","J Pharm Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2892917","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Lisinopril; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics; Heart Failure/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This metabolite is cleared by both  hepatic and renal routes, while most other ACE inhibitors are cleared exclusively  by the kidney. In the present study, after administration of multiple fixed oral  doses the accumulation of the active moieties of fosinopril, enalapril and  lisinopril was compared in patients with renal insufficiency. 29 patients with  creatinine clearances (CLCR) less than 30 ml/min received either fosinopril 10mg  (n = 9), enalapril 2.5mg (n = 10) or lisinopril 5mg (n = 10) once daily for 10  days in a nonblind (open-label) parallel study. Pharmacokinetic parameters  including area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), peak serum  concentration (Cmax) and time to peak concentration (tmax), as well as renal  function, blood pressure, and plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels,  were determined on the first and last days of the study. The percentage (+/- SEM)  increases in AUC from day 1 to day 10 for fosinoprilat, enalaprilat and  lisinopril were 26.8 +/- 9.9 (nonsignificant), 76.6 +/- 16.6 (p less than 0.001)  and 161.7 +/- 31.8% (p less than 0.001), respectively. These results indicate  that there was significantly less accumulation of fosinoprilat, based on  accumulation indices, relative to either enalaprilat (p less than 0.05) or  lisinopril (p less than 0.001) during the study. The Cmax of fosinopril increased  significantly less than that of lisinopril (21.1 vs 123.6%; p less than 0.01).

Enalapril was  administered orally as a novel extemporaneous suspension in children younger than  6 years of age and as tablets in older children. First-dose and steady-state  pharmacokinetics were estimated in children ages 1 to 24 months, 25 months to < 6  years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 16 years. Maximum serum concentrations for  enalapril occurred approximately 1 hour after administration. Serum  concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, peaked between  4 and 6 hours after the first dose and 3 and 4 hours after multiple doses. The  area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), adjusted for body surface  area, did not differ between age groups. Based on comparison of first-dose and  steady-state AUCs, the accumulation of enalaprilat in children ranged from 1.13-  to 1.45-fold. For children ages 2 to 15 years, mean urinary recovery of total  enalaprilat ranged from 58.3% in children ages 6 to < 12 years to 71.4% in  children ages 12 to < 16 years. Urinary recovery for children ages 2 to < 6 years  was 66.8%. The mean percentage conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat ranged from  64.7% for children ages 1 to 24 months to 74.6% for children ages 6 to < 12  years. The median effective half-life for accumulation ranged from 14.6 hours in  children ages 12 to < 16 years to 16.3 hours in children ages 6 to < 12 years.  There were two serious adverse events, neither of which was attributed to  enalapril or resulted in discontinuation of the study drug. The extemporaneous  suspension used in this study was tolerated well. The pharmacokinetics of  enalapril and enalaprilat in hypertensive children ages 2 months to 15 years with  normal renal function appears to be similar to that previously observed in  healthy adults.","2001-10","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:31:28","","1064-1074","","10","41","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11583474","","","","Adolescent; Humans; Male; Female; Analysis of Variance; Area Under Curve; Child; Confidence Intervals; Child, Preschool; Infant; Antihypertensive Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Enalapril/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine; Enalaprilat/blood/urine; Hypertension/*blood/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lisinopril was administered orally (10-mg dose once daily for 5 or 8 days).  Measurement of blood pressure (BP) and sampling of blood specimens were made on  the first and last days of treatment. During consecutive dosing of lisinopril,  its antihypertensive effects were sustained for greater than or equal to 12 h  with less diurnal variation of BP. Serum ACE activity was markedly suppressed for  24 h. Plasma levels of lisinopril in the IRF group were higher than those in NRF  with significant differences in the peak levels and areas under the plasma  concentration time curve (AUC). A significant inverse correlation was found  between the creatinine clearance and the AUC for lisinopril. These results  suggest that lisinopril has a long-lasting action and that it is a useful  antihypertensive agent for controlling BP in patients with either NRF or mild  IRF.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the examination of  drug compatibility, three groups of pigeons (n = 8 each) received enalapril into  the crop at a dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg body weight, or placebo, respectively. Health  status, and water and food consumption were monitored regularly, and clinical,  hematological and blood-chemical parameters were determined. To determine a  suitable starting dosage, birds were treated with enalapril at a dose of 2.5  mg/kg (first trial) and 1.25 mg/kg (second trial), and blood samples were  collected at defined time points. Using high performance liquid chromatography  (HPLC), the enalapril concentration in the plasma samples was determined.  RESULTS: Drug application did not cause any significant drug-related difference  between the groups. Nearly all measured parameters were found to be within normal  physiological ranges. Only for hematocrit was a slight but significant increase  found for the group treated with 5 mg/kg enalapril. In pigeons, after application  of 2.5 mg/kg enalapril, the maximum plasma concentration was found in the first  sample taken (388.2 ± 174.1 mg/kg). The application of 1.25 mg/kg resulted in a  maximum concentration of 116.1 ± 70.2 ng/ml after 30 minutes in pigeons. In the  Amazon birds, the maximum value was found after 1 hour (first sampling) of 43.3  ±6.0 ng/ml. In all examinations, the enalapril concentration was <15 ng/ml after  8 hours. The terminal half-life was 2.68 hours for pigeons and 2.36 hours for  Amazons. CONCLUSION: The results underline the good compatibility of enalapril  after oral administration in healthy pigeons. A starting dosage of 1.25 mg/kg  enalapril given twice daily can be recommended.

The duration of  plasma ACE inhibition due to enalapril was greatly prolonged by the impairment of  renal function, whereas that due to temocapril was affected very little. Urinary  recovery of temocapril diacid was decreased markedly in patients with severe  renal dysfunction, most probably because the diacid was excreted through the  biliary route. On the other hand, urinary recovery of enalapril diacid remained  fairly high even in patients with severe renal impairment, because of extremely  high plasma diacid concentrations resulting from the lack of biliary excretion.

The enalapril values for the area under the  curve (AUC(0)--> infinity ) were 480 +/- 216 and 832 +/- 325 ngh/mL, maximum  plasma concentrations (C(max)) were 310 +/- 187 and 481 +/- 185 ng/mL, and times  required to reach the maximum concentration t(max) were 1.13 +/- 0.22 and 1.09  +/- 0.33 h for 10 and 20 mg doses, respectively. The enalaprilat values for  AUC(0)--> infinity were 256 +/- 122 and 383 +/- 158 ngh/mL, C(max) values were 57  +/- 29 and 72.9 +/- 33.6 ng/mL and t(max) values were 4.28 +/- 1.45 and 4.05 +/-  01.22 h for 10 and 20 mg doses, respectively. The C(max) values of enalapril were  approximately 10 times higher than those in the literature, which were determined  by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition assays following alkaline  hydrolysis, but similar to those of enalaprilat. The PD profiles revealed a  significant correlation between enalaprilat concentrations in plasma and the  decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (r = -0.95 with P < 0.001 and  r = -0.95 with P < 0.001), respectively, following a single oral dose of  enalapril. These ELISA methods have the advantage of being simple, accurate,  sensitive, and do not depend on enalaprilat binding to ACE. Such methods can be  used for analysis and kinetic testing of enalapril and enalaprilat in biological  fluids.","2002-06","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:26","","237-244","","3","16","","Fundam Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12165071","","","","Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Sensitivity and Specificity; Indicators and Reagents; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Enalapril/*blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Enalaprilat/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Serologic Tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: An open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-period, crossover trial with  a 1-week washout period in 24 healthy volunteers. The 2 enalapril 20 mg tablet  formulations used were Antiprex (Elpen, Greece) as test and Renitec (Vianex,  Greece) as reference preparation. Serial blood samples were collected at 19  points for 36 h. Plasma samples were analyzed for enalaprilat, the  pharmacologically active metabolite of enalapril, by a validated GC/MS assay.  Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as AUC(0-infinity), AUC(0-t), C(max) T(max),  t1/2 and MRT were calculated from plasma concentrations for both formulations.  Statistical comparisons (ANOVA and 90% confidence intervals) of AUC(0-infinity),  AUC(0-t) and C(max) data were evaluated after logarithmic transformation, and  differences of T(max) were tested non-parametrically. RESULTS: The parametric 90%  confidence intervals of the geometric mean values of the test/reference ratios  were 88.0 - 117.6% (point estimate: 101.8%) for AUC(0-infinity), 88.7 - 118.9%  (point estimate: 102.7%) for AUC(0-t), and 91.0% - 123.4% (point estimate:  106.0%) for C(max) No statistically significant differences were found between  the 2 preparations for T(max) t1/2 and MRT values.

There is evidence that enalapril may be an organic anion-transporting  polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) substrate, suggesting that genetic polymorphisms of the  OATP1B1 gene may play a role in causing the interindividual pharmacokinetic  differences of this drug. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate  the functional significance of the OATP1B1 genetic polymorphism on the  pharmacokinetics of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in healthy  Chinese adult male participants. METHODS: This was a single-center, open-label,  single- and multiple-dose study conducted in healthy Chinese male participants.  Each participant received a single oral dose of 10 mg enalapril under fasting  conditions, followed by enalapril 10 mg/d for 7 days. In the single-dose phase,  sequential blood samples were collected from 0 to 24 hours after drug  administration. In the multiple-dose phase, samples were obtained before drug  administration on days 4, 5, 6, and 7; on day 7, samples were collected from 0 to  72 hours after drug administration. An HPLC-MS/MS method was used to determine  plasma concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat. A polymerase chain reaction  technique was used for genotyping of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of  the OATP1B1 gene: T521C and A388G. The pharmacokinetic parameters of enalapril  and enalaprilat were then compared according to genotype groups, using 1-way  ANOVA, except for T(max) in which the Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test  was used. RESULTS: The study included 32 healthy Han Chinese male participants  (age range, 18-28 years; weight range, 50.0-80.0 kg; height range,159-182.0 cm).  Twenty-six were OATP1B1*15 noncarriers (homozygous for 521TT), the others were  *15 carriers with at least one 521 T>C mutant allele. After single and multiple  oral doses of 10 mg enalapril, plasma concentrations of enalapril in *15  noncarriers were lower than that in *15 carriers, with significant difference in  area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) between *15 noncarriers and *15  carriers (P = 0.048) in the multiple-dose phase. There were no significant  differences in enalapril's AUC(0-24), C(max), or the ratio of the AUC(0-24h) in  the single-dose study to the AUC(ss) (R(ac)) between the *15 carriers and  noncarriers. In contrast to enalapril, the mean AUC(0-24h) and C(max) of  enalaprilat in *15 noncarriers was significantly higher than those in *15  carriers (P = 0.040 and P = 0.027, respectively) in the single-dose phase. There  were no significant differences in enalaprilat's AUC(ss) or C(maxss) between the  2 groups in the multiple-dose phase. For the 3 groups classified according to the  effect of A388G variant in all subjects homozygous for 521T (TT), *1a/*1a,  *1a/*1b, and *1b/*1b, no significant difference was found in AUC(0-24h), C(max),  and T(max) of enalapril and enalaprilat. CONCLUSIONS: In this small population of  healthy Chinese men, the OATP1B1*15 allele and T521C variant appeared to be an  important determinant of the pharmacokinetics of enalapril. There were  significant differences between the *15 carriers and noncarriers in enalapril's  AUC(ss) and enalaprilat's AUC(0-24h), C(max), and R(ac). However, there were no  significant differences in enalapril's AUC(0-24), C(max), or enalaprilat's  AUC(ss), C(maxss) between the *15 carriers and noncarriers.","2011-05","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:31:09","","655-663","","5","33","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Lisinopril, the lysine analogue of enalaprilat, is biologically active following  absorption and is cleared via the urine without any known metabolic  transformation. In the hemodynamic study, single doses of lisinopril (1.25-10.0  mg) were administered on days 1 and 3, each followed by 48 h of intensive  hemodynamic observation in 12 patients. Arterial and mixed venous blood from the  right atrium were sampled frequently and assayed for angiotensin I, angiotensin  II, ACE activity, plasma renin activity, renin substrate, plasma aldosterone, and  serum drug concentration. Across all doses, reductions in mean arterial pressure  (-17.2%), mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-28.0%), and systemic vascular  resistance (-25.6%) were observed compared to baseline values. No significant  changes in heart rate or cardiac index were observed. The analysis of the  hormonal parameters indicate potent inhibition of the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system for a period exceeding 24 h. In the  pharmacokinetic study, 12 hospitalized patients with chronic CHF received  lisinopril both orally and intravenously, with each dose followed by a 72-h  arterial blood and urine sampling schedule.

Tablets containing the fixed  combination of lisinopril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were administered  as a single dose followed by daily administration for 6-8 days. Serum  concentration and haemodynamic measurements were made at intervals up to 48 hours  after the first and last doses. The serum profiles of both drugs were comparable  with observations from previous studies, showing higher concentrations in the  elderly and in the renally impaired patients. Similar differences have been  reported for such patient groups when the drugs were administered separately,  indicating an absence of pharmacokinetic interaction. Both drugs accumulated by  about 30% on multiple daily dosing. There were no differences between the patient  groups in the extent of accumulation. The combination of lisinopril and  hydrochlorothiazide produced the expected hypotensive response, minimum BP values  being recorded 4 and 6 hours after treatment. The higher concentrations in the  elderly and renally impaired patients were not associated with a greater  reduction in BP. The pharmacokinetic behaviour of lisinopril and  hydrochlorothiazide given together to elderly and renally impaired hypertensive  patients suggests that a fixed dose combination is appropriate and that no  changes to the dosage regimen additional to those used for the individual agents  are necessary.","1991-12","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:25:35","","77-84","","","5 Suppl 2","","J Hum Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 1665183","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Drug Combinations; Aging/*metabolism; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Lisinopril; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Kidney Diseases/complications/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After  administration of single doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg enalapril in the congestive  heart failure patients and 20 or 40 mg in the hypertensive patients, serum levels  and urine elimination of enalapril and MK 422 were determined. Standing and  supine heart rate and blood pressure were measured as was ejection fraction in  the congestive heart failure group and renin activity, aldosterone levels, and  converting enzyme activity in the hypertensive group. Apparent oral clearance  after administration of 5 and 10 mg enalapril was lower in the congestive heart  failure patients (0.6 +/- 0.2 and 0.7 +/- 0.4 L/min) than after 20 and 40 mg  given to hypertensive patients (2.5 +/- 1.3 and 2.7 +/- 2.7 L/min). The  elimination of MK 422 was also slower in the congestive heart failure patients  (7.8 +/- 5.0 and 6.8 +/- 2.5 h after 5 and 10 mg enalapril, respectively, vs. 4.6  +/- 2.0 and 5.3 +/- 1.1 h after 20 and 40 mg, respectively, in the hypertension  group). The enalapril area under the concentration-time curve increased  disproportionately to dose increments in both groups, but was more pronounced in  congestive heart failure. Twenty and 40 mg enalapril lowered the blood pressure  by 2 h after dosing in the hypertension group, and peak effects were seen 4-5 h  after dosing. Peak effects correlated with peak serum MK 422 concentrations but  not with enalapril (MK 421) levels. Supine heart rates were unchanged after 20  mg, but increased after 40 mg; standing heart rates were transiently increased  after 20 and 40 mg enalapril. Blood pressure was not significantly changed in the  congestive heart failure group, and cardiac ejection fraction was unchanged. In  the hypertension group, renin stimulation and converting enzyme activity  inhibition were seen at 4 h and persisted for at least 24 h after administration  of 40 mg enalapril. In summary, the clearance of enalapril and elimination of MK  422 was slower in congestive heart failure patients versus hypertensive patients.  Therefore, slower onset and longer duration of drug effect might be anticipated  in patients with congestive heart failure versus patients with hypertension  during enalapril administration.","1985-08","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:28:42","","767-776","","4","7","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2410720","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Kinetics; Middle Aged; Aged; Half-Life; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Indocyanine Green; Aldosterone/blood; Renin/blood; Enalaprilat; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Enalapril; Hypertension/*metabolism/physiopathology; Antihypertensive Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology; Dipeptides/*metabolism/pharmacology; Heart Failure/*metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study compared the pharmacokinetics and  pharmacodynamics of enalapril and an NO-releasing enalapril molecule (NCX899) in  conscious male beagles. The effects of both enalapril and NCX899 in the arterial  hypertension and bradycardia induced by acute NO inhibition in anaesthetized dogs  were also investigated. 2. Dogs received either NCX899 (4 micromol/kg, i.v.) or  enalapril (4 micromol/kg, i.v.), after which plasma concentrations of the  analytes and metabolites were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to  tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 3. In the NCX899 group, the area under the  time-course curve (AUC(0-24h)) was 29.18 +/- 4.72, 229.37 +/- 51.32 and 5159.23  +/- 514.88 microg.h/L for the analytes nitro-enalapril, enalapril and  enalaprilat, respectively.

Statistical analysis of data from both groups showed a  significant difference for the analyte enalapril, but not for enalaprilat.  Moreover, NCX899 and enalapril were equally effective in inhibiting the activity  of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. 4. In anaesthetized dogs, i.v.  administration of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl  ester (l-NAME; 0.1-10 mg/kg) significantly elevated arterial blood pressure, with  concomitant bradycardia. The compound NCX899 significantly attenuated both  arterial hypertension and bradycardia, whereas enalapril had no significant  effect. 5. In conclusion, the present results showed that the NO-releasing  derivative of enalapril NCX899 presents a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  relationship similar to its parent compound enalapril.

The  effect of candesartan on pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat in nephrotic rats was  investigated to make references for the clinical therapy in patients with  nephropathy to avoid related adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nephrotic  rats were prepared by adriamycin injection. Control group and one nephrotic group  received enalapril alone, another nephrotic group received enalapril and  candesartan simultaneously. Blood samples were drawn at time points after a  single oral administration. The concentration of enalaprilat was determined using  LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Compared with control group and nephrotic group received  enalapril alone respectively, Tmax of enalaprilat in nephrotic group received  both enalapril and candesartan cilexetil prolonged about 21.43% and 6.224%,  respectively; AUC(0-t) increased by 185.3% and 60.63%, respectively; Cmax  increased by 219.4% and 56.64%, respectively; t1/2 increased by 163.7% and  30.05%, respectively; CL/F reduced by 65.12% and 40.78%, respectively. There were  no significant differences of the V1/F of enalaprilat between three groups. The  CL/F and t1/2 of enalaprilat showed significant correlations with serum  creatinine (Scr) respectively (r = -0.7502; r = 0.5626). DISCUSSION: The  combination with candesartan in nephrotic rats significantly changed the  pharmacokinetics of enalaprilat, showing increased accumulation and decreased  elimination. In view of these findings, we should lower dosage and prolong dosing  interval for nephrotic patients in the combination of enalapril and candesartan.","2012-12","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:22:38","","2162-2170","","15","16","","Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 23280035","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Drug Interactions; Biphenyl Compounds; Tetrazoles/*pharmacology; Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Enalaprilat/*pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/*pharmacology; Nephrosis/*drug therapy/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enalapril maleate is a prodrug  requiring in vivo hepatic esterolysis to yield the active diacid inhibitor  enalaprilat. CHF results in changes in regional blood flow that may affect the  gastrointestinal absorption, hepatic hydrolysis and renal excretion of enalapril  and enalaprilat. In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of enalapril in CHF,  the following treatments were given: enalapril 10 mg orally, enalapril 5 mg  intravenously and enalaprilat 5 mg intravenously. Each dose was followed by a  72-hour period with frequent blood sampling and fractionated urine collection for  the radioimmunoassay of both enalapril and enalaprilat. Mean absorption for the  oral dose was 69%, hydrolysis 55%, bioavailability 38%, urinary recovery 77% and  estimated first-pass effect 10%. The results were compared with available data in  normal subjects. After oral administration of 10 mg enalapril, the extent of  absorption, the degree of hydrolysis and the bioavailability in CHF patients  appear to be similar to those in normal subjects, with differences less than 10%.  The rates of absorption and hydrolysis appear to be slightly slower in CHF. The  serum concentrations of enalaprilat were consistently greater in CHF, and maximal  concentrations were reached at 6 hours in CHF compared with 4 hours in normal  subjects. The maximal hypotensive responses were similar for all three  treatments, although the onset of action was rapid following intravenous  enalaprilat. It is concluded that the presence of CHF does not appreciably alter  the pharmacokinetic behaviour of enalapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1986","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:22:54","","40-44","","","32 Suppl 5","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3032562","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Administration, Oral; Injections, Intravenous; Biological Availability; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Enalapril/administration & dosage/*metabolism/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: To determine  whether 20 mg enalapril wafer is bioequivalent to the conventional 20 mg  enalapril tablet, an open-label, two-period crossover study was performed in 16  healthy male volunteers. Cumulative urinary recovery of free enalaprilat (active  metabolite of enalapril) and the serum maximum concentration of free enalaprilat  (Cmax) were the primary pharmacokinetic parameters used to determine  bioequivalence in this study. Bioequivalence was defined as the geometric mean  ratio (wafer: tablet) falling within the equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for  both parameters. RESULTS: Cumulative urinary recovery of free enalaprilat (0 - 72  hours) was similar between the wafer and conventional tablet formulations  (arithmetic mean 5.13 vs. 5.03 mg, about 36% of dose). The geometric mean ratio  of the urinary recovery of free enalaprilat (wafer: tablet) was 1.03 (90% CI:  0.93, 1.15). Cmax of serum enalaprilat was also similar between the wafer and  conventional tablet formulations (arithmetic mean 85.7 vs. 76.3 ng/ml).

Doses of 0.3, 1.0, 1.5, 3.125, and 6.25 mg were  investigated for 24 h in three groups of five patients each. All doses  demonstrated a significant reduction in serum ACE, even after 24 h.

Maximal significant hemodynamic effects occurred approximately 4-6 h after drug  administration. The plasma concentrations of spirapril and its metabolite  spiraprilate were dose-dependent. After administration of spirapril, the quick  rise to the peak level of spiraprilate suggests rapid metabolism of spirapril  into spiraprilate and a slow elimination of this metabolite. No severe  hypotension or other serious side effects occurred in the patients studied.

This study examined the relative bioavailability of  enalapril suspension (10 mg) (S) compared with 10-mg marketed VASOTEC tablets (T)  in 16 healthy adult subjects. The geometric mean ratio (S/T) estimate of urinary  recovery of free enalaprilat, the active moiety, was 0.92 (90% confidence  interval (CI): 0.80, 1.07). Urinary recovery data indicate that approximately 50%  of the dose was absorbed (50% recovered in urine as enalapril plus enalaprilat)  with about 30% of the dose recovered as free enalaprilat for both S and T.

The effect of enalapril on the in vitro and in vivo  cleavage of BIO1211 was investigated. In heparinized blood, plasma and rat liver,  lung and intestinal homogenates, BIO1211 was converted rapidly to BIO1588 by  hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal dipeptide moiety. This cleavage could be  inhibited by EDTA and the ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat, the de-esterified acid  derivative of enalapril. Enalaprilat inhibited the hydrolysis of BIO1211 in a  concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) values of 2 nM in human and sheep  plasma and 10 nM in rat plasma. In rat lung homogenate supernatant, the maximum  inhibition of the conversion of BIO1211 to BIO1588 was approximately 80% at 1  microM with no further effect up to 100 microM of enalaprilat. Following a  concomitant IV administration of enalapril and BIO1211 at 3 mg/kg each, the AUC  and the half-life values of BIO1211 increased 18- and 10-fold, respectively.

Supplement : official journal of the International Society of Hypertension","","0952-1178","","","The clearance of drugs excreted entirely unchanged by the kidneys is assumed to relate directly to renal function. The clearance of drugs which are entirely  metabolized is usually not altered in patients with renal impairment, although  there are examples of both increased and decreased metabolic clearance rates. The  clearance of metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the kidneys is also  directly related to renal function. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors enalapril, ramipril, cilazapril and quinapril are prodrugs that are  rapidly converted to active metabolites which are excreted unchanged through the  kidneys. Studies have consistently demonstrated reduction in the apparent oral  clearance of the active metabolites, in proportion to the degree of impairment of  renal function. In addition, for quinapril at least, the metabolic clearance of  the parent drug is slightly reduced in renal impairment. The activity of  captopril and lisinopril lies in the parent molecule itself. Lisinopril is  excreted renally unchanged, while captopril is both metabolized and excreted  renally unchanged. The duration of ACE inhibition after administration of any of  the ACE inhibitors is prolonged in proportion to the degree of renal impairment.  From these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, it follows that the  dose rate of the ACE inhibitors should be reduced in direct proportion to the  degree of reduction in renal function. Reducing the dose, rather than prolonging  the dose interval, is more logical for compliance and for maintaining a  consistent degree of ACE inhibition over 24 h.","1989-09","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:22:33","","S29-32","","5","7","","J Hypertens Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2681603","","","","Humans; Time Factors; Osmolar Concentration; Creatinine/metabolism; *Tetrahydroisoquinolines; Quinapril; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics; Kidney Diseases/blood/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An overview.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199325040-00003","","The conventional pharmacokinetic profile of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, is a lipid-soluble and relatively inactive prodrug  with good oral absorption (60 to 70%), a rapid peak plasma concentration (1 hour)  and rapid clearance (undetectable by 4 hours) by de-esterification in the liver  to a primary active diacid metabolite, enalaprilat. Peak plasma enalaprilat  concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours after oral enalapril administration.  Elimination thereafter is biphasic, with an initial phase which reflects renal  filtration (elimination half-life 2 to 6 hours) and a subsequent prolonged phase  (elimination half-life 36 hours), the latter representing equilibration of drug  from tissue distribution sites. The prolonged phase does not contribute to drug  accumulation on repeated administration but is thought to be of pharmacological  significance in mediating drug effects. Renal impairment [particularly creatinine  clearance < 20 ml/min (< 1.2 L/h)] results in significant accumulation of  enalaprilat and necessitates dosage reduction. Accumulation is probably the cause  of reduced elimination in healthy elderly individuals and in patients with  concomitant diabetes, hypertension and heart failure. Conventional  pharmacokinetic approaches have recently been extended by more detailed  descriptions of the nonlinear binding of enalaprilat to ACE in plasma and tissue  sites. As a result of these new approaches, there have been significant  improvements in the characterisation of concentration-time profiles for  single-dose administration and the translation to steady-state. Such improvements  have further importance for the accurate integration of the pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic responses to enalapril(at) in a concentration-effect  model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1993-10","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:21","","274-282","","4","25","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 8261712","","","","Humans; Animals; Enalaprilat/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Enalapril/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study  included 36 hypertensive patients with steatosis, hepatic cirrhosis and ulcer.  All the patients received metoprolol or enalapril. Concentrations of metoprolol  and enalaprilate (active enalapril metabolite) were determined with high  performace liquid chromatography. The findings gave grounds for calculation of  mean drug retention time (MRT) and area under curve ""concentration-time"" (AUC).  Efficacy of the drugs was estimated by the data of 24-h blood pressure  monitoring. RESULTS: Hypertensive patients with hepatic diseases given enalapril  exhibited lowering of maximal concentration (C(max)) of enalaprilate and  prolongation of time of its reaching (T(max)) compared to ulcer patients. MRT and  AUC were increased in hepatic cirrhosis patients treated with enalapril and  metoprolol. Metoprolol C(max) in this group of patients was higher than in the  controls. Blood pressure monitoring showed that enalapril therapy was more  effective in ulcer patients vs patients with liver diseases. Metoprolol treatment  of hypertensive patients with hepatic cirrhosis resulted in development of  bradycardia. CONCLUSION: In hypertensive patients with liver diseases on  enalapril therapy its metabolite production may appear insufficient for  therapeutic effect and higher dose may be needed. Metoprolol in the treatment of  hypertensive patients with hepatic cirrhosis should be used with caution because  of disturbance of its metabolism and possible cumulative effects.","2007","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:01","","18-25","","9","79","","Ter Arkh","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 18038581","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; *Liver Cirrhosis/epidemiology/metabolism/physiopathology; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Enalapril/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*metabolism; Metoprolol/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fragments considered being inactive degradation products might mediate actions previously  attributed to ANG II. The study aimed to determine whether angiotensin fragments  exert biological activity when administered in amounts equimolar to physiological  doses of ANG II. Cardiovascular, endocrine, and renal effects of ANG II, ANG III,  ANG IV, and ANG-(1-7) (6 pmol.kg-1.min-1) were investigated in conscious dogs  during acute inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (enalaprilate) and  aldosterone (canrenoate). Furthermore, ANG III was investigated by step-up  infusion (30 and 150 pmol.kg-1.min-1). Arterial plasma concentrations [ANG  immunoreactivity (IR)] were determined by an ANG II antibody cross-reacting with  ANG III and ANG IV. Metabolic clearance rates were higher for ANG III and ANG IV  (391 +/- 19 and 274 +/- 13 ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively) than for ANG II (107 +/-  13 ml.kg-1.min-1). ANG II increased ANG IR by 60 +/- 7 pmol/ml, blood pressure by  30%, increased plasma aldosterone markedly (to 345 +/- 72 pg/ml), and plasma  vasopressin transiently, while reducing glomerular filtration rate (40 +/- 2 to  33 +/- 2 ml/min), sodium excretion (50 +/- 7 to 16 +/- 4 micromol/min), and urine  flow. Equimolar amounts of ANG III induced similar antinatriuresis (57 +/- 8 to  19 +/- 3 micromol/min) and aldosterone secretion (to 268 +/- 71 pg/ml) at much  lower ANG IR increments ( approximately 1/7) without affecting blood pressure,  vasopressin, or glomerular filtration rate. The effects of ANG III exhibited  complex dose-response relations. ANG IV and ANG-(1-7) were ineffective. It is  concluded that 1) plasma clearances of ANG III and ANG IV are higher than those  of ANG II; 2) ANG III is more potent than ANG II in eliciting immediate sodium  and potassium retention, as well as aldosterone secretion, particularly at low  concentrations; and 3) the complexity of the ANG III dose-response relationships  provides indirect evidence that several effector mechanisms are involved.","2003-11","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:31:25","","R971-980","","5","285","","Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12869367","","","","Female; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Dogs; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Natriuresis/drug effects; Consciousness; Aldosterone/blood; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Diuresis/drug effects; Vasopressins/blood; Angiotensin I/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Angiotensin II/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Angiotensin III/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Peptide Fragments/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects/*physiology; Renin/*physiology; Vasoconstrictor Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this trial zofenopril calcium and enalapril maleate (CAS  76095-16-4) were given to 20 healthy volunteers of both sexes in repeated dose  regiment at two dose levels: 30 mg and 60 mg zofenopril calcium and 10 mg and 20  mg enalapril maleate. The study was conducted according to a two-period,  two-sequence, crossover design, with washout. ACE activity in serum and  zofenopril, zofenoprilat, enalapril and enalaprilat plasma concentrations were  determined during and on the last day of the two study periods. Both zofenopril  and enalapril were extensively converted through hydrolysis to their active  metabolites zofenoprilat and enalaprilat, respectively. Zofenopril exhibited a  complete and a more rapid hydrolysis rate compared to enalapril, which is  reflected by the higher metabolite to parent drug ratio of Cmax and AUCss, tau  showed by this compound. Even though only two dose levels were investigated in  this trial, the pharmacokinetics of both drugs seem to be linear. In line with  previous trials, both compounds at both dose levels investigated produced  complete or almost complete inhibition of ACE activity in serum, for a period  lasting 6-8 h after administration, the inhibition being still relevant 24 h  thereafter. The tolerability of the two drugs at both dose levels proved to be  very good as demonstrated by subjective and objective symptoms, by the absence of  relevant adverse events, and by laboratory biochemical parameters and vital signs  evaluated before and after the trial. Blood pressure showed a fairly decreasing  trend with both the drugs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values being  however within normal range in all the subjects. In no case symptoms of  hypotension were experienced. In conclusion, zofenopril calcium and enalapril  maleate show very good tolerability and appear to exert similar activity on serum  ACE. The main difference in the pharmacokinetics of the two compounds is the  conversion from pro-drug to the active metabolite which is faster with  zofenopril.","2002","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:25","","233-242","","4","52","","Arzneimittelforschung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 12040965","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Area Under Curve; Biotransformation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Captopril/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Enalapril/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten  dogs were randomly assigned to 2 groups of 5 animals in a 2-period crossover  design for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration. Renal failure  was surgically induced by right nephrectomy and electrocoagulation of the  remaining kidney. Renal mass reduction induced a significant decrease (P < .001)  in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (1.7 +/- 0.3 versus 3.3 +/- 0.7  mL/kg/minute). No significant differences before and after surgery were observed  for enalapril and benazepril kinetics.

We studied whether the dosage of enalapril in daily clinical  practice is associated with drug accumulation of enalaprilat in chronic renal  failure. METHODS: Fifty nine out-patients with plasma creatinine >150 micromol/L  and chronic antihypertensive treatment with enalapril were investigated, in a  cross-sectional design. RESULTS: Median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was  23(range 6-60) ml/minute/1.73 m2. The daily dose of enalapril was 10 (2.5-20) mg  and the trough serum concentration of enalaprilat was 31.8 (<2.5-584.7)ng/ml.  Ninety percent of the patients had higher serum concentrations of enalaprilat  than has been reported in subjects with normal kidney function, and a marked  elevation of serum enalaprilat was observed in patients with GFR <30 ml/minute.  All but three patients had serum ACE activity below the reference range. The ACE  genotype did not influence the results. Additional pharmacokinetic studies were  done in nine patients in whom GFR was 23 (10-42)ml/minute/1.73 m2. The median  clearance of enalaprilat was 28 (16-68) ml/minute and correlated linearly with  GFR (r=0.86, p=0.003). Intra-subject day-to-day variation in trough  concentrations was 19.7%. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic renal failure given  small or moderately high doses of enalapril may thus have markedly elevated  levels of serum enalaprilat. Whether this affords extra renoprotection, or on the  contrary may inappropriately impair renal function, is not known, and should be  investigated in prospective, controlled studies.","2001-12","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:23:07","","240-245","","4","2","","J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 11881130","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Genotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/administration & dosage/blood; Enalaprilat/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension, Renal/*drug therapy/genetics; Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*drug therapy/genetics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to determine its tolerability, primarily  the impact on renal function, Spirapril was tested in a single-blind trial with a  2-week placebo run-in phase and a 4-week active treatment period. Forty-nine  patients (34 males and 15 females) with varying degrees of renal impairment were  included. Their pretreatment diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranged from 95 to 115  mm Hg. Spirapril was administered in oral doses of 6 mg once daily. RESULTS:  Forty-four patients completed the study. Four patients dropped out due to side  effects, 1 patient was withdrawn from the study due to lack of antihypertensive  efficacy. 48% of the completers with renal failure achieved a normalized  diastolic blood pressure (DBP < or = 90 mm Hg) or a reduction in DBP of > or = 10  mm Hg; the corresponding figure for patients with normal renal function was 31%.  Renal function was assessed in the beginning and at the end of the active  Spirapril treatment period using Tc-99m-DTPA-clearance (representing glomerular  filtration rate), J-131-hippuran-clearance (representing renal plasma flow) and  creatinine clearance. Particularly in patients with renal impairment, Spirapril  did not deteriorate renal function as given by these parameters. Regression  analysis revealed a linear correlation between total plasma clearance of the  active metabolite Spiraprilate and creatinine clearance. There was no evidence  for drug accumulation.

The fall begins with a 2.5 mg dose  of the drug, is maximum with 10 mg and is not increased by higher doses. No  tachyphylaxis has been observed with prolonged administration. The fall in blood  pressure is due to reduction of peripheral resistance, without changes in heart  rate and cardiac output. There is no sodium retention. The two main  pharmacokinetic features of the drug are its very long half-life and the 100%  urinary excretion of the active metabolite.

Thus, too often in the past, research into antihypertensive drugs has  ignored the importance of underlying plasma drug concentrations and has sought to  attribute the variability in antihypertensive response to factors such as age and  plasma renin activity. In studies with hypertensive patients in which  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices have been integrated, we have  demonstrated that the intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetics of  verapamil, nifedipine, enalapril, and amlodipine is directly related to the  variability in blood pressure response at steady state. The characteristic low  variability in the peak and predose, steady-state plasma concentrations  associated with amlodipine are reflected in a correspondingly low variability in  the blood pressure response. In addition, using the trough-to-peak, steady-state,  blood pressure response as an index of 24-h duration of action, amlodipine  exhibited significantly higher values with lower variability (66 +/- 11%) when  compared to verapamil (47 +/- 13%), nifedipine (48 +/- 9%) and enalapril (44 +/-  15%).

STUDY DESIGN: Between  gestational days 122 and 126 (term 167 days) five rhesus macaques underwent  surgery for implantation of maternal and fetal vascular catheters. At least 4  days after surgery maternal and fetal blood pressures and heart rates were  recorded for 1 hour. This was followed by a 5-minute maternal venous infusion of  saline solution vehicle and recording for an additional hour. Enalaprilat was  then infused over 5 minutes through the maternal femoral artery at doses of 0.05,  0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg. Maternal and fetal arterial blood samples were collected for  determination of blood gas status and plasma enalaprilat concentrations. RESULTS:  Enalaprilat rapidly crossed the placenta, and fetal values for areas under the  concentration time curve were 50% to 65% of maternal values across dose groups.  Drug was retained in the fetal plasma approximately threefold to fourfold longer  than in maternal plasma. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, arterial Po2 and pH  were unchanged after enalaprilat infusion, as were fetal heart rate and blood  gases. In contrast, fetal arterial pressure decreased significantly (19% to 23%,  p < 0.01) after maternal treatment with 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg and remained depressed  throughout the 6-hour study interval. At 0.05 mg/kg fetal arterial pressure was  decreased by 13% from baseline; differences were not significantly different (p >  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that enalaprilat rapidly  crosses the primate placenta with a single intravenous administration to the  mother, resulting in significant and prolonged reduction of fetal arterial  pressure. Because maternal cardiovascular parameters were unaffected, enalaprilat  appears to have a direct effect on fetal arterial pressure.","1996-07","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:23:04","","50-55","","1","175","","Am J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8694075","","","","Female; Animals; Time Factors; Pregnancy; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Heart Rate/*drug effects; Macaca mulatta; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Infusions, Intra-Arterial; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Enalaprilat/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Fetus/*drug effects/physiology; Heart Rate, Fetal/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The degree of ACE inhibition in  response to quinapril varied in tissues; marked inhibition was observed in aorta,  lung, and plasma by single treatment with quinapril, and inhibition in plasma and  aorta caused by quinapril was more potent than that caused by enalapril. The  prolonged ACE inhibition was observed in the aorta, a target organ, by repeated  treatment with quinapril for 2 weeks. These results indicate that quinapril has a  good pharmacokinetic profile, namely rapid absorption and easy penetration to the  target organ. In addition, quinapril produced greater inhibition of cardiac ACE  than did enalapril after either p.o. or intravenous (i.v.) administration,  suggesting the beneficial effects of quinapril in treatment of congestive heart  failure (CHF).","1992-01","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:28:08","","102-107","","1","19","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1375675","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Tissue Distribution; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacology; Rats, Inbred SHR; *Tetrahydroisoquinolines; Quinapril; Isoquinolines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Myocardium/enzymology/metabolism; Splanchnic Circulation/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, despite the evidence of a significant influence of renal impairment  upon the disposition of spiraprilat, the lack of accumulation during the  translation from single to multiple doses indicates that there is a considerable  margin of safety for spirapril in renal impairment.","1994","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:32","","14-19","","","2","","Blood Press Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Sweden PMID: 8061840","","","","Humans; Single-Blind Method; Kidney Diseases/*metabolism; Creatinine/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/*metabolism; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seven different single doses of UP269-6 ranging from 5 to 180  mg, 20 mg enalapril, or placebo were administered to 16 subjects in a  double-blind fashion. The order of placebo and enalapril was randomized, and  UP269-6 was given in an ascending dose order. The peak systolic blood pressure  (SBP) response to a test dose of ANG I was determined serially before and after  oral drug administration by monitoring finger BP by a photoplethysmographic  method. No drug-related side effect was observed. There was a dose-dependent  inhibition of the SBP response to the ANG I challenge. Doses as low as 40 to 80  mg had blocking effects quite similar to that of enalapril 20 mg. Ten hours after  the 20- and 40-mg doses of UP269-6, the SBP response was still attenuated when  drug levels no longer were measurable in plasma. UP269-6 also produced a  dose-related increase in active renin and ANG II levels at 24 h after drug  intake. In these volunteers on unrestricted salt intake, no statistically  significant effect on 24-h urinary aldosterone excretion was observed. Based on  these preliminary data, the pharmacokinetic drug half-life (t 1/2) was estimated  at 4.7 h and the EC50 was estimated at 41 ng/ml. UP269-6 appears to be a  well-tolerated, potent, orally active, antagonist of ANG II receptors in men.  Doses of 40-80 mg might block the ANG I pressor response as does enalapril 20 mg.","1995-06","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:24:35","","986-993","","6","25","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7564346","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Analysis of Variance; Double-Blind Method; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Blood Pressure Determination; Plethysmography; Renin/blood; *Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Aldosterone/urine; Angiotensin II/blood; Enalapril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Angiotensin I/administration & dosage/*adverse effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Tetrazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-198510050-00001","","The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. In  addition, they are useful pharmacological probes to assess the contribution of  the renin-angiotensin system to circulatory homeostasis. Captopril was the first  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor approved for use in patients with  hypertension and congestive heart failure. It is rapidly absorbed from the  gastrointestinal tract, with detectable plasma concentrations apparent as early  as 15 minutes. The extent of absorption is between 60 and 75% of an oral dose and  peak plasma concentrations occur after approximately one hour. Captopril is  primarily excreted by the kidneys via renal tubular secretion. Renal excretion is  rapid, with 90% completed in the first 4 hours. The elimination half-life for  unchanged captopril is about 1.7 hours and is markedly increased in the presence  of renal insufficiency. Once absorbed, captopril is extensively metabolised to  several forms, including a disulphide dimer of captopril, a captopril-cysteine  disulphide, and other mixed disulphides with endogenous thiol compounds. It is  probable that captopril and its pool of metabolites undergo reversible  interconversions. Pharmacokinetic properties of captopril in patients with  uncomplicated hypertension appear to be the same as in healthy subjects. However,  long term administration of captopril leads to increased concentrations of total  captopril, probably from the accumulation of captopril metabolites. Despite the  number of potential influences on pharmacokinetic properties in patients with  congestive heart failure, due to the many abnormalities in gastrointestinal tract  oedema and reductions in splanchnic and renal blood flow, the available data  suggest that its pharmacokinetic properties in patients with congestive heart  failure resemble those in healthy subjects. However, additional data are  necessary to confirm this. Enalapril is the second angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitor to become available. Enalapril is a prodrug that is well absorbed from  the gastrointestinal tract, with 60 to 70% of an oral dose being absorbed.  However, enalapril must be converted by hepatic esterases to the active form,  enalaprilat. After the oral administration of enalapril, the tmax for enalapril  is one hour, but for enalaprilat it is 4 hours. There is a prolonged terminal  elimination phase with enalaprilat being detectable as late as 96 hours after  dosing. Thus, enalapril has a much longer duration of action than captopril. Like  captopril, enalapril is primarily excreted by the kidneys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT  400 WORDS)","1985-10","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:25:33","","377-391","","5","10","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2994938","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Intestinal Absorption; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tissue Distribution; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Hypertension/drug therapy/physiopathology; Enalaprilat; Heart Failure/drug therapy/physiopathology; Captopril/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Enalapril/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic interactions of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-blocker  propranolol in healthy volunteers and patients with essential hypertension. We  also evaluated the effect of cilazapril on aortic compliance in hypertension by  pulse-wave velocity along the aorta. We showed that single oral doses of  cilazapril 4 mg, captopril 25 mg, or enalapril 10 mg shifted the angiotensin I  dose-effect curve to the right and determined a pharmacologic half-life of about  4 h for cilazapril. Increasing single oral doses (1.25, 3.75, 10, and 30 mg) of  cilazapril reduced diastolic blood pressure dose-dependently and shifted the  angiotensin I dose-response curves to the right.

The plasma concentrations of an active metabolite of both the  imidapril and enalapril groups increased according to the doses and showed almost  the same plasma concentrations at the same doses. Both groups significantly  inhibited plasma ACE activity and reduced SBP, and these actions were maintained  for 4 weeks.

Also, the imidapril group significantly  decreased the relative heart weight at the rate of 300 micrograms/rat/day.  Furthermore, good correlations between plasma imidaprilat concentration and  plasma ACE activity or SBP were observed, suggesting that plasma concentration  may be a useful marker of pharmacological effects.

The current study identifies the active components in GFJ  responsible for its esterase-inhibitory effect. The esterase-inhibitory potential  of 10 constitutive flavonoids and furanocoumarins toward p-nitrophenylacetate  (PNPA) hydrolysis was investigated. The furanocoumarins bergamottin,  6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, and bergapten, and the glycoside flavonoids naringin  and hesperidin, at concentrations found in GFJ or higher, did not inhibit the  hydrolysis of PNPA by purified porcine esterase and human liver microsomes.  However, the flavonoid aglycones morin, galangin, kaempferol, quercetin, and  naringenin showed appreciable inhibition of PNPA hydrolysis in purified porcine  esterase, and human and rat liver systems. In Caco-2 cells, demonstrated to  contain minimal CYP3A activity, the permeability coefficient of the prodrugs  lovastatin and enalapril was increased in the presence of the active flavonoids  kaempferol and naringenin, consistent with inhibition of esterase activity. In  rats, oral coadministration of kaempferol and naringenin with these prodrugs led  to significant increases in plasma exposure to the active acids. In addition, in  portal vein-cannulated rats, coadministration of lovastatin with kaempferol (10  mg/kg) led to a 154% and a 113% increase in the portal plasma exposure to the  prodrug and active acid, respectively, compared with coadministration with water.  The contribution of CYP3A inhibition was demonstrated to be minimal. Overall, a  series of flavonoids present in GFJ are identified as esterase inhibitors, of  which kaempferol and naringenin are shown to mediate pharmacokinetic drug  interaction with the prodrugs lovastatin and enalapril due to their capability of  esterase inhibition.","2007-07","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:10","","1203-1208","","7","35","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17452418","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; In Vitro Techniques; Administration, Oral; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Hydrolysis; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; *Food-Drug Interactions; Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymology; Caco-2 Cells; Fruit; *Citrus paradisi; Flavanones/pharmacology; Nitrophenols/metabolism; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics; Beverages/*analysis; Esterases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Enalapril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Enzyme Inhibitors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology; Flavonoids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology; Kaempferols/pharmacology; Lovastatin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How does it differ from other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors?","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199300462-00027","","Among the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that differentiate trandolapril from other angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors, the most clinically relevant ones are those that contribute to the  long duration of action of the drug. The long elimination half-life of  trandolapril and its strong lipophilicity, high ACE inhibitor potency and high  affinity for the ACE cause the drug to have a long biological half-life. The long  duration of action of trandolapril may be demonstrated experimentally; near total  ACE inhibition is observed 24 hours after single dose administration and there is  significant ACE inhibition 72 hours following drug withdrawal after long term  therapy. We have analysed the duration of blood pressure lowering during long  term therapy with commercially available ACE inhibitors in published studies  using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. On the basis of results from 19  studies undertaken in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, it was  possible to reconstruct the curve of the magnitude of blood pressure changes  against time. Mean trough: peak ratio calculations showed that once-daily  administration produced ratios higher than 50% with enalapril (40 to 80%),  lisinopril (40 to 70%) and trandolapril (50 to 100%). Other ACE inhibitors had  trough: peak ratios lower than 50%. Despite many methodological limitations, this  literature analysis demonstrates that trandolapril has a blood pressure-lowering  effect for the full 24-hour period. Studies in which a dose is occasionally  omitted show that the blood pressure-lowering effect of trandolapril may last  beyond 24 hours.","1993","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:31:33","","172-181; discussion 182","","","46 Suppl 2","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7512472","","","","Humans; Animals; Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Hypertension/drug therapy/physiopathology; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antihypertensive treatment of arterial hypertension with angiotensin converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to be effective with a low incidence of  adverse effects compared with other drug classes. Furthermore, treatment with ACE  inhibitors may slow the progression of renal function impairment in certain  groups of patients, such as those with diabetes. Most ACE inhibitors are prodrugs  which are converted by hepatic esterolysis to an active diacid metabolite. Only  captopril and lisinopril have sufficient oral bioavailability and are given as  active drugs. ACE inhibitors can be subdivided into 3 classes with regard to the  active group: the majority of ACE inhibitors are carboxyl-containing drugs, a new  class of ACE inhibitors possess a phosphoryl-group and captopril and related  compounds are sulfhydryl-containing drugs. The predominant elimination pathway of  ACE inhibitors is excretion via the kidneys. Therefore, renal insufficiency is  associated with reduced elimination of most ACE inhibitors and, thus, altered  pharmacokinetic properties. This is most evident in chronic renal failure when  glomerular filtration rates (GFR) are < 30 to 40 ml/min (1.8 to 2.4 L/h). As  renal clearance decreases, the peak plasma concentration and area under the  plasma concentration-time curve of the active drugs or diacids are increased and  time to peak concentrations and half-life are prolonged. However, there are large  between-drug differences in the changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, resulting  in different degrees of drug accumulation after consecutive administration. This  leads, for example, to high accumulation rates for drugs such as lisinopril, or  cilazaprilat. In contrast, fosinopril, which is also excreted to a large extent  by the hepatobiliary pathway, does not seem to accumulate in renal failure. In  general, pharmacokinetics and conversion of prodrugs seem to be slightly affected  in chronic renal failure; however, these changes do not appear to be clinically  relevant. Efficiency of clearance for prodrugs or active drugs and their  respective metabolites by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis varies  considerably. For some ACE inhibitors, such as captopril or enalapril, the high  elimination fraction by haemodialysis necessitates a supplemental dose after  dialysis. Other ACE inhibitors, such as quinapril or cilazapril, are only poorly  eliminated by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Dosage recommendations for  treatment with ACE inhibitors in chronic renal failure depend on the specific  pharmacokinetic properties of the various agents. For most ACE inhibitors, dosage  adjustment is recommended in moderate and severe impairment of renal function,  with resultant dosages being 25 to 50% of those recommended for patients with  normal renal function.","1993-03","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:24:34","","230-254","","3","24","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 8462229","","","","Humans; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Renal Dialysis; Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Hypertension, Renal/complications/drug therapy/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enalapril maleate is unlike the prototype angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor  captopril in that a standard meal does not appear to influence absorption of this  new drug.","1984-11","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:28:54","","1655-1657","","11","73","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6097665","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Biological Availability; *Food; Enalapril; Antihypertensive Agents/*metabolism/urine; Dipeptides/*metabolism/urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition,  the disappearance of ET-1 in arterial and central venous plasma after an infusion  of 10 ng kg-1 min-1 was quantified, and the effects of vasopressin (AVP, 10 ng  kg-1 min-1) and angiotensin II (AII, 2, 5, and 10 ng kg-1 min-1) on plasma ET-1  were investigated. The step-up infusion of ET-1 increased the plasma level from  3.6 +/- 0.3 to 243 +/- 23 pg ml-1. Concomitantly, arterial blood pressure  increased and heart rate (HR) decreased dose-dependently.

After a 28-day placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to 28 days  of once-daily, double-blind, double-dummy treatment with telmisartan 40, 80, or  120 mg; enalapril 20 mg; or placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was manually recorded  for 12 hours after the first dose and after 24 hours at baseline (Day 0), Day 1,  and Day 28 of double-blind treatment. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  parameters were assessed from telmisartan plasma concentrations. All doses of  telmisartan and enalapril significantly reduced BP compared with placebo (p < or  = 0.01). Mean +/- SE reductions in supine DBP after 28 days of treatment ranged  between 7.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg and 9.8 +/- 1.3 mmHg in the telmisartan groups, 9.6 +/-  1.3 mmHg with enalapril, and 1.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg with placebo. Mean +/- SE  reductions in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) were between 10.0 +/- 2.2 mmHg  and 15.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg with telmisartan versus 10.2 +/- 2.1 mmHg with enalapril;  placebo increased supine SBP by 3.5 +/- 2.1 mmHg. The BP reductions after 4 weeks  of treatment with telmisartan were no different from those achieved with  enalapril. No significant linear trend in BP reduction was evident among  telmisartan doses. Reductions in SBP and DBP were maintained over the 24-hour  period at Day 28. Treatment did not affect supine heart rate. Trough/peak DBP  ratios were > or = 85% for all telmisartan doses versus 65% for enalapril. High  interpatient variability in telmisartan plasma concentrations was observed. For  example, mean +/- SD values for Cmax were 159 +/- 104 ng/mL for telmisartan 40  mg, 693 +/- 606 ng/mL for telmisartan 80 mg, and 1635 +/- 1406 ng/mL for  telmisartan 120 mg. Plasma concentration-effect analyses indicated that the  antihypertensive effects of telmisartan 40, 80, and 120 mg are at the plateau  region of the concentration-response curve. All active treatments were well  tolerated, with tolerability profiles similar to placebo, and telmisartan did not  produce any clinically relevant first-dose effects.

METHODS: Angiotensin II (3 pmol kg(-1) min(-1)-3.1 ng kg(-1) min(-1)) or AngIII  (15 pmol kg(-1) min(-1)-14 ng kg(-1) min(-1)) was infused i.v. during acute  inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (enalaprilate; 2 mg kg(-1)) and of  aldosterone (canrenoate; 6 mg kg(-1) plus 1 mg kg(-1) h(-1)). Arterial plasma  concentrations of angiotensins were determined by radioimmunoassay using a  cross-reacting antibody to AngII. During ongoing peptide infusion, candesartan (2  mg kg(-1)) was administered to block the AT1-receptors. RESULTS: Angiotensin  immunoactivity in plasma increased to 60 +/- 10 pg mL(-1) during infusion of  AngII or infusion of AngIII. AngII significantly increased mean arterial blood  pressure (+14 +/- 4 mmHg) and plasma aldosterone by 79% (+149 +/- 17 pg mL(-1))  and reduced plasma renin activity and sodium excretion (-41 +/- 16 mIU L(-1) and  -46 +/- 6 micromol min(-1) respectively). AngIII mimicked these effects and the  magnitude of AngIII responses was statistically indistinguishable from those of  AngII. All measured effects of both peptides were blocked by candesartan.  CONCLUSION: At the present arterial plasma concentrations, AngIII is equipotent  to AngII with regard to effects on blood pressure, aldosterone secretion and  renal functions, and these AngIII effects are mediated through AT1- receptors.  The metabolic clearance rate of AngIII is five times that of AngII.","2006-10","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:24:07","","129-138","","2","188","","Acta Physiol (Oxf)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16948800","","","","Female; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Dogs; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Biphenyl Compounds; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Aldosterone/blood; Renin/blood; Enalaprilat/pharmacology; Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/pharmacology; Tetrazoles/pharmacology; Benzimidazoles/pharmacology; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects/physiology; Angiotensin II/blood/pharmacology; Angiotensin III/blood/*pharmacology; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1/physiology; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drug undergoes hepatic hydrolysis into its major active diacid metabolite,  quinaprilat, and two minor inactive metabolites. On a weight basis quinaprilat is  three times as potent an ACE inhibitor as quinapril. Approximately 60 percent of  an oral dose of quinapril is absorbed. In contrast with captopril, the absorption  of quinapril is unaffected by food. Peak serum concentrations of quinapril and  quinaprilat are achieved within one and two hours, respectively. Approximately 61  percent of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine, principally as  quinaprilat. The elimination half-life of quinaprilat is three hours, but is  prolonged up to 11 hours in patients with renal dysfunction. Quinapril dose  reduction is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of 0.50 mL/sec  or less. In the elderly the elimination of quinaprilat is reduced and correlates  well with renal function. In patients with cirrhosis the hydrolysis of quinapril  to quinaprilat is impaired resulting in lower plasma quinaprilat concentrations  and up to a two-fold increase in quinapril half-life. Quinaprilat has a strong  binding capacity to tissue ACE allowing for once-daily dosing. The recommended  starting dose for quinapril is 20 mg/d. The nature and incidence of adverse  reactions to quinapril are similar to those of enalapril and captopril.  Quinapril's antihypertensive efficacy is equal to that of captopril and  enalapril.

Reduction in blood pressure during  dilevalol administration is associated with peripheral vasodilatation, and heart  rate remains essentially unchanged. Following oral administration, dilevalol is  completely absorbed. Once-daily administration is possible, due to a long  elimination half-life. Large well-controlled trials reveal that dilevalol is  equivalent in antihypertensive efficacy to metoprolol, the ACE inhibitors  captopril and enalapril, and the calcium antagonist nifedipine. Smaller  noncomparative and comparative trials demonstrate the blood pressure-lowering  effects of dilevalol and suggest an efficacy at least equivalent to that of the  'pure' beta-blockers atenolol and propranolol and the alpha 1-blockers urapidil  and doxazosin. Dilevalol appears to be well tolerated, the most frequent adverse  effects being dizziness, headache and diarrhoea in only about 7% of patients  each. Unlike alpha 1-blockers and labetalol, dilevalol is not commonly associated  with orthostatic hypotension. Thus, data suggest that dilevalol, with its  distinctive pharmacological profile, is likely to be a useful addition to the  options currently available for treating patients with mild to moderate essential  hypertension.","1990-02","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:22:47","","234-263","","2","39","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2184002","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Rats; Dogs; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Guinea Pigs; Hypertension/drug therapy; Labetalol/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compound 2 is well absorbed from rat  jejunum, whereas lisinopril absorption is relatively low. The permeability of  both ACE inhibitors is concentration dependent and is decreased by the dipeptide  Tyr-Gly and by cephradine, indicating a nonpassive absorption mechanism via the  peptide carrier-mediated transport system. Compound 2 is well absorbed by a  nonpassive mechanism, in parallel with a small passive component. The estimated  dimensionless carrier parameters for 2 are J*max = 0.16, Km = 0.08 mM, P*c = 2.0,  and P*m = 0.25; for lisinopril, passive absorption is not significant and its  absorption is nonpassive: J*max = 0.032, Km = 0.082 mM, and P*c = 0.39 (where  J*max is the maximal flux, Km is the Michaelis constant, P*c is the carrier  permeability, and P*m is the passive permeability).

When placed in the maternal perfusate at a high therapeutic serum concentration  (150 ng/ml), enalaprilat was rapidly transferred from the maternal perfusate into  placental tissue followed by a gradual release from the placenta into the fetal  perfusate. Cmax and AUC values for enalaprilat in the maternal perfusate were  approximately 3 times higher than in the fetal perfusate, and drug levels did not  equilibrate between maternal and fetal perfusates during the 4-6 hours of  perfusion. The more highly perfused regions of the placental lobule had higher  drug levels than non-perfused areas. At the end of the perfusion period, the mean  percent of total drug added in the maternal perfusate was 59%, with 23% in the  fetal perfusate and the remainder (18%) in placental tissue. Despite the  relatively high levels of drug found in placental tissue, there were no  alterations in placental function as measured by fetal volume loss, fetal  pressure, glucose utilization, lactate production, hCG release, net fetal oxygen  transfer, and oxygen consumption. Results from this study clearly document  placental transfer of enalaprilat in the perfused human placental lobule system.  The lack of effect on placental function suggests that enalaprilat has no direct  effect on fetoplacental vascular beds, and that fetal hypotension occurring from  ACE inhibitor exposure may be due to direct effects on the fetal kidney and not  to decreased perfusion of fetoplacental vascular beds; these findings require  further validation in an in vivo model.","1998-10","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:33","","76-81","","3-4","58","","Teratology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9802186","","","","Humans; Female; In Vitro Techniques; Area Under Curve; Half-Life; Pregnancy; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Enalaprilat/*pharmacokinetics; Placenta/anatomy & histology/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanistic understanding of the absorption and the role of intestine and liver  in the activation of oral prodrugs is crucial. Enalapril, a carboxyl ester  prodrug, is reported to be metabolized by human carboxylesterase-1 (CES1) but not  by carboxylesterase-2 (CES2) to its active metabolite enalaprilat. Further, it  has been reported that the small intestines of both rat and human contain mainly  CES2. The objective of this work was to understand whether enalapril remains  unchanged as it is absorbed through the intestine into the portal circulation.  This was evaluated using different intestinal preparations, an in situ intestinal  perfusion experiment and a portal vein cannulated rat model. No turnover of  enalapril was seen with commercial rat intestinal S9 and microsomes, but  reasonable turnover was observed with freshly prepared rat intestinal and mucosal  homogenate and S9. In the intestinal perfusion study, both enalapril and  enalaprilat were observed in the mesenteric plasma with the data suggesting 32%  hydrolysis of enalapril in the intestine. In the portal vein cannulated rat,  about 51% of enalapril absorbed into intestine was converted to enalaprilat.  Overall, it was demonstrated that even though enalapril has been shown to be a  specific substrate for CES1, it is converted to enalaprilat to a significant  extent in the intestine. Such experimental techniques can be applied by other  scientific groups who are working on prodrugs to determine the region and extent  of activation.

We therefore studied the effect of a single dose of 20 mg enalapril on Na  excretion in 8 healthy subjects, using lithium clearance and maximal water  diuresis to analyze tubular Na handling. Because the natriuretic effect may  depend on the volume state, the same subjects were studied during low (20 mmol  Na/day), medium (200 mmol Na/day), and high (400 mmol Na/day) salt intake.  Enalapril caused natriuresis during the 20-mmol Na diet (from 51 +/- 9 to 81 +/-  14 mumol/min, p < 0.05) and the 200-mmol Na diet (from 190 +/- 24 to 230 +/- 31  mumol/min, p < 0.05), but not during the 400-mmol Na diet. The increase in Na  excretion was not accompanied by consistent changes in glomerular filtration rate  (GFR), free water clearance data, maximal urine flow, uric acid clearance, or  lithium clearance. Instead, the increase in Na excretion was positively related  to the increase in Na concentration in the maximally diluted urine (r = 0.75, p <  0.01). Regardless of diet, enalapril reduced the filtration fraction, but a  significant increase in effective renal plasma flow was noted only during the  20-mmol Na diet. The data suggest that a decrease in Na reabsorption in the  diluting segment, perhaps related to renal vasodilatation, participates in the  natriuretic effect of ACE inhibition in humans.","1993-07","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:31:22","","27-32","","1","22","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7690092","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Reference Values; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Sodium, Dietary/*administration & dosage; Enalapril/*pharmacology; Natriuresis/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ACEI was replaced by nifedipine or clonidine in 15 kidney  transplant patients immunosuppressed with AZA and prednisone (enalapril in 14 and  captopril in 1). Before and during 10 to 12 weeks after withdrawal of the ACEI,  AZA metabolites, renal function parameters and hematological parameters including  erythropoietin and reticulocytes were evaluated. Enalaprilat levels were measured  and compared with 15 similar patients matched for transplant function and  enalapril dosage immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and prednisone. AZA  metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the ACEI.  Enalaprilat levels also showed no significant difference between the two patient  groups treated with AZA or cyclosporine. Hematocrit and hemoglobin increased  significantly from 37.5 +/- 6.4 to 39.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD, P = 0.02) and 12.8  +/- 2.2 to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl, P = 0.04, respectively, 10 to 12 weeks after ACEI  treatment had been discontinued. Simultaneously numbers of reticulocytes and  erythropoietin concentrations rose significantly after 2, 4 and 10 weeks, with a  peak at two weeks (from 14.1 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 8.0/1000, P < 0.05 and from 14.3  +/- 12.4 to 29.3 +/- 54.5 mU/ml, P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion,  ACEI-related anemia in renal transplant recipients seems to be due to the  erythropoietin-lowering effect of this group of drugs. A pharmacokinetic  interaction between AZA and enalapril is not likely since plasma enalaprilat  levels were independent of the immunosuppressive regimen and AZA metabolite  levels were unchanged in the presence and absence of the ACEI. Several mechanisms  by which angiotensin converting enzyme blockade may cause a decrease in  circulating erythropoietin are discussed.","1996-09","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:24:15","","973-978","","3","50","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8872973","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Drug Interactions; Hematocrit; *Kidney Transplantation; Cyclosporine/pharmacology; Hemoglobins; Anemia/*chemically induced; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics; Azathioprine/metabolism/pharmacology; Enalaprilat/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics; Erythrocytes/chemistry; Erythropoietin/blood; Immunosuppressive Agents/metabolism/pharmacology; Kidney Diseases/complications/drug therapy/surgery; Thioguanine/analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They will, however, all inhibit ACE, and their  hypotensive effect will be a consequence of this action. Enalapril (MK-421) is an  esterified prodrug, which in man is converted by the liver to the bioactive  potent ACE inhibitor enalaprilate (enalaprilic acid, MK-422). This probably  accounts for the slower plasma appearance of MK-422 and the longer duration of  action of enalapril. The clinical significance of deesterification by the liver  needs further study but minor abnormalities of liver function, such as occur in  congestive heart failure, do not affect the rate of deesterification and hence  the plasma enalaprilat levels. A close relationship between the plasma drug  level, degree of ACE inhibition, and the hormonal and hypotensive effect can be  demonstrated after both acute and chronic enalapril administration to  hypertensive patients. Chronic therapy with enalapril leads to induction of ACE  but in humans this is not sufficient to lead to resistance or tolerance to the  drug. Enalapril offers an exciting new approach to the treatment of hypertension  with some distinct advantages over conventional antihypertensive therapy.","1986","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:25:15","","S9-14","","","8 Suppl 1","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2422495","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Biological Availability; Liver/metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism; Oligopeptides/*metabolism; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*metabolism; Enalaprilat; Enalapril/analogs & derivatives/blood; Esterification; Hypertension/blood/drug therapy; Teprotide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Natural medicines are the main alternatives to  treatment for a majority of people suffering from hypertension. Niazicin-A,  Niazimin-A, and Niaziminin-B compounds from Moringa oleifera ethanolic leave  extract were reported to have potent antihypertensive activity. OBJECTIVE: These  compounds were targeted with Angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] which is one of  the main regulatory enzymes of the renin-angiotensin system. METHODS:  Protein-ligand docking of these compounds with [ACE] [both domain N and C] was  conceded out through Autodock vina and visualization was done by chimera.  Pharmacokinetics study of these compounds was predicted by ADME-Toxicity  Prediction. RESULTS: Niazicin-A, Niazimin-A, and Niaziminin-B showed high binding  affinity with ACE and partially blocked the active sites of the enzyme.  Niazicin-A, Niazimin-A and Niaziminin-B showed the estimated free binding energy  of -7.6kcal/mol kcal/mol, -8.8kcal/mol and -8.0kcal/mol respectively with  C-domain of ACE and -7.9kcal/mol, -8.5kcal/mol and -7.7kcal/mol respectively with  N-domain of ACE. The compounds showed better binding energy with  angiotensinconverting enzyme in comparison to Captopril -5.5kcal/mol and  -5.6kcal/mol and Enalapril [standard] -8.4kcal/mol and -7.5kcal/mol with C and N  domain, respectively. CONCLUSION: Computationally, the selected bioactive  molecules have shown better binding energy to known standard drugs which have  been already known for inhibition of ACE and can further act as a pharmacophore  for in vitro and in vivo studies in the development of alternative medicine.","2019","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:25:30","","239-248","","3","13","","Recent Pat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 30747089","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Substrate Specificity; Protein Binding; Gene Expression; Molecular Docking Simulation; Plant Leaves/chemistry; Patents as Topic; Thermodynamics; Catalytic Domain; angiotensin converting enzyme; Docking; captopril; and Moringa oleifera; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism; autodock vina; Captopril/chemistry/metabolism; Enalapril/chemistry/metabolism; hypertension.; Hypertension/drug therapy/enzymology; Moringa oleifera/*chemistry; Niazicin-A; Niazimin-A; Niaziminin-B; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism; Plant Extracts/chemistry; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Thiocarbamates/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential in essential hypertension.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199243010-00009","","Fosinopril is a phosphinic acid prodrug which, after oral administration, undergoes rapid hydrolysis to its active diacid, the angiotensin converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinoprilat. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, fosinoprilat  has a compensatory dual route of elimination and is cleared by the liver and  kidneys. Thus, in patients with diminished renal function increased hepatic  clearance of fosinoprilat is noted and, similarly, in patients with diminished  hepatic function increased renal clearance seems to occur. Because of this  compensatory elimination, fosinopril therapy for all patients can begin with the  same recommended dosage. Fosinopril 10 to 40mg administered once daily is an  effective antihypertensive regimen that has shown efficacy similar to that of  enalapril 5 to 10 mg/day, propranolol 80 to 160 mg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 to  50 mg/day and sustained release nifedipine 40 mg/day in preliminary clinical  trials. Generally, fosinopril is well tolerated and adverse events associated  with the drug are usually mild and similar to those associated with other ACE  inhibitors. Thus, fosinopril appears to be a useful alternative to certain  'established' agents used for treating patients with essential hypertension.","1992-01","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:28:06","","123-140","","1","43","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1372856","","","","Humans; Animals; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Fosinopril; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Proline/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We therefore examined  the renal clearance of enalaprilat in normal volunteers and compared it with  simultaneously measured inulin and creatinine clearances to explore the  contribution of tubular secretion to the renal elimination of the drug. Twelve  healthy male subjects with an age range of 24 to 58 years (mean +/- SE, 33.1 +/-  2.8) were studied.

This report compares the renal excretory mechanisms for these  structurally related compounds in the rat. After an iv, 1-mg/kg dose, ratios of  renal clearance (CLR) of unbound drug to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for  enalaprilat and lisinopril were 2.72 +/- 0.70 and 1.01 +/- 0.18, respectively,  suggesting that enalaprilat, but not lisinopril, was actively secreted by the  kidneys.

MET was devoid of any effect on creatinine clearance, mean blood  pressure or renal vascular resistance, but moderately increased plasma lactate  (3.8 +/- 0.5 vs 3.2 +/- 0.2 mM, P<0.05) and decreased angiotensin II-induced  renal vasoconstriction. ARF, although mild, decreased renal MET clearance (0.29  +/- 0.05 vs 1.01 +/- 0.31 ml/min/100 g, P<0.05) and increased plasma and renal  tissue MET levels (x 2-4). MET however did not worsen the fall in glomerular  filtration rate, nor modify renal vascular reactivity. ARF did not change the  MET-elicited moderate increase in plasma lactate. CONCLUSION: Despite the  increase in MET plasma and renal tissue levels subsequent to moderate ARF, no  harmful metabolic effect on plasma lactate and no further impairment of renal  function was observed in MET-treated diabetic rats subjected to ARF.","2003-04","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:22:29","","163-170","","2 Pt 1","29","","Diabetes Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 12746638","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tissue Distribution; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Kidney Cortex/metabolism; Kidney Medulla/metabolism; Creatinine/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*drug therapy; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Metformin/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Acute Kidney Injury/*complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prodrugs were designed to improve the permeability of LVV across  the intestinal epithelium by targeting the di/tri-peptide carrier, PepT1. Caco-2  cell monolayers were employed to study the transport and hydrolysis properties of  the prodrugs. Among all mono amino acid ester prodrugs studied, the  LVV-5'-(L)-valine prodrug (R1518) exhibited the maximum increase (48-fold) in  permeability with nearly complete conversion to LVV within 1 h. Di-amino acid  esters did not offer significant enhancement in permeability comparing with mono  amino acid esters and exhibited slower conversion to LVV in Caco2 cell  monolayers. Pharmacokinetic screening studies of the prodrugs in rats yielded the  highest fold increase (6.9-fold) of AUC with R1518 and in general displayed a  similar trend to that observed in increases of permeability in Caco-2 cells.  Mechanisms involved in the Caco-2 cell transport of R1518 were also investigated.  Results of bi-directional transport studies support the involvement of  carrier-mediated transport mechanisms for R1518, but not for the  LVV-5'-(D)-valine prodrug or LVV. Moreover, the permeability of R1518 was found  to be proton dependent. PepT1-mediated transport of R1518 was supported by  results of competitive transport studies of R1518 with the PepT1 substrates  enalapril, Gly-Sar, valganciclovir, and cephalexin. R1518 was also found to  inhibit the permeability of valganciclovir and cephalexin. These results suggest  that R1518 is a PepT1 substrate as well as an inhibitor.","2006-06","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:08","","1318-1325","","6","95","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16634069","","","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Area Under Curve; Hydrolysis; Biological Transport; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Intestinal Absorption/drug effects; Molecular Structure; *Drug Delivery Systems; Caco-2 Cells; Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects; Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism; Esters; Peptide Transporter 1; *Protons; Amino Acids/*pharmacokinetics; Monosaccharides/chemistry/pharmacology; Prodrugs/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Symporters/*administration & dosage; Triazoles/chemistry/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The antihypertensive effect of oral ketanserin 40 mg  twice daily is comparable with that of total daily doses of metoprolol 200 mg,  propranolol 160 mg, captopril 100 mg, enalapril 20 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg,  or alpha-methyldopa 1000 mg and is achieved without adverse effect on plasma  lipoproteins or carbohydrate metabolism in patients with concomitant diabetes  mellitus. Evidence from prospective studies suggests a greater antihypertensive  efficacy in the elderly than in younger patients. In patients with intermittent  claudication, results have been inconsistent in small studies, while a large  study showed no improvement in pain-free walking distance but fewer amputations  compared to placebo. In Raynaud's phenomenon symptomatic improvement relative to  placebo was achieved in larger trials. Its role in preventing atherosclerotic  complications requires further investigation. Ketanserin is reasonably well  tolerated, the frequency of adverse effects being comparable with that of other  antihypertensive drugs in controlled trials. Dizziness, tiredness, oedema, dry  mouth and weight gain are the most commonly reported effects. Ketanserin prolongs  QT interval in a dose-related manner, and when given in certain predisposing  circumstances ventricular arrhythmias and syncope may occur. Administered  intravenously, ketanserin 10mg followed by an infusion of 2 to 4 mg/h controls  moderate to severe pre- and postoperative hypertension in most patients, acting  as a balanced vasodilator, lowering cardiac pre- and afterload.

A review.","Clinical pharmacokinetics","","0312-5963","10.2165/00003088-199019030-00003","","The orally active angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) such as captopril and enalapril represent a significant therapeutic advance in the  treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Enalapril differs from  captopril in several respects. It is a prodrug converted by hepatic esterolysis  to the active (but more poorly absorbed) diacid, enalaprilat. Enalaprilat is more  potent than captopril, more slowly eliminated and does not possess a sulfhydryl  (SH) group. Enalapril was rapidly followed by a number of newer ACE inhibitors,  the majority of which are similar to enalapril in that they are prodrugs,  converted by hepatic esterolysis to a major active but poorly absorbed diacid  metabolite. In one case (delapril) there are 2 active metabolites; in another  (alacepril) the prodrug is converted in vivo to captopril. Lisinopril is an  exception in that it is an enalaprilat-like diacid but with acceptable oral  bioavailability, so that the prodrug route is not employed. The newer ACE  inhibitors are at widely different stages of development, and it is not yet clear  how many will reach regular clinical use. Of these newer drugs, lisinopril is the  longest established and is the subject of the widest published literature. For a  number there is as yet little published pharmacokinetic information. A variety of  assay methods have been employed to characterise the pharmacokinetics of the ACE  inhibitors, including enzymatic techniques, radioimmunoassay and chromatography.  The peak plasma concentrations of the prodrugs are generally observed at around 1  hour and those of the diacid metabolites at about 2 to 4 hours. However, there is  considerable variation within and between drugs, with benazepril and benazeprilat  reaching peak concentrations early and enalapril and enalaprilat typical of later  times to peak. Absorption of the active diacids is generally poor, and moderate  (typically 30 to 70%) for the prodrugs. The bioavailability of lisinopril is  about 25%. It is difficult to talk meaningfully about half-lives of the active  drugs. The declines in their plasma concentrations are polyphasic and, if  analytical sensitivity allows, active drug may be found at 48 hours or more  following administration. This may reflect binding to ACE in plasma. Half-lives  of accumulation are of the order of 12 hours; protein binding varies from little  (lisinopril) to 90% (benazeprilat). Elimination is mostly renal but there may be  biliary elimination for some, such as benazeprilat and fosinopril. The half-lives  of the prodrugs are short. Impaired renal function decreases the elimination rate  of the diacids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-09","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:25:29","","177-196","","3","19","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2203579","","","","Humans; Animals; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/analysis/blood/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical pharmacokinetic considerations.","Drugs & aging","","1170-229X","10.2165/00002512-199101030-00004","","The incidence of both systolic and diastolic hypertension is increased in elderly patients, therefore antihypertensive drugs are commonly used in this population.  In addition to changes in blood pressure, the aging process also causes numerous  changes in other physiological parameters, resulting in altered pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic responses to the drugs. The dosage regimens for thiazide  diuretics and amiloride must be individually titrated in the elderly patient,  since the elimination of these agents decreases concurrently with decreased renal  function, as indicated by compromised creatinine clearance. The initial doses of  the calcium antagonists should be decreased in elderly patients, since  representative compounds from all 3 chemically heterogeneous classes have been  shown to have decreased clearance in these patients which appears to be primarily  due to the status of hepatic function in the patient. However, with verapamil,  the dosage should be further decreased in association with compromised renal  function. The dosage of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should  be adjusted according to renal function rather than age. Lisinopril, which is  primarily eliminated unchanged, is usually given in lower doses in the elderly,  and doses of both captopril and enalapril may need to be reduced, depending on  renal function. While there is no need to adjust the dosage regimen for the  alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (prazosin, terazosin), caution should be used  with the beta-adrenergic blockers, particularly the hydrophilic agents, since  they are renally eliminated. Labetalol may be a suitable alternative beta-blocker  for the elderly patient, since its pharmacodynamic properties of decreased  systemic vascular resistance without changes in heart rate or stroke volume are  preferential for the elderly patient, and its pharmacokinetics are relatively  unchanged in this population. Drugs that act primarily through the central  nervous system, such as clonidine, methyldopa and guanfacine, require smaller  doses in the presence of renal dysfunction. In contrast, guanabenz is metabolised  primarily by the liver, so it would appear to be useful in elderly patients with  renal dysfunction despite the lack of studies in this population. Guanadrel, an  adrenergic neuron blocking drug, also requires a dosage reduction in patients  with impaired renal function. In addition to the pharmacokinetic changes that  occur in the elderly patient, pharmacodynamic changes may also be anticipated due  to receptor modifications. Older patients have a decrease in beta-receptor  sensitivity, while alpha-receptor sensitivity does not change. When designing the  dosage regimen for a senior patient with hypertension, the combination of all  these variables must be considered.","1991-05","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:28:24","","194-211","","3","1","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1686570","","","","Humans; Aged; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics; Hypertension/*drug therapy/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Diuretics/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using an ambulatory blood  pressure monitoring technique, we compared, in a cross-over design study, the  effects of four weeks' treatment with enalapril, 10 mg once daily, to lisinopril,  10 mg once daily, on the blood pressure of 19 patients with mild to moderate  hypertension. A significant reduction in blood pressure was shown by both drugs.  However, lisinopril produced a greater fall in mean 24 hour systolic pressure  than did enalapril (difference; 5.94 (C.I. -0.77 to -11.1) mmHg, P = 0.027). The  difference of 3.3 mmHg (C.I. +0.54 to -7.10) in diastolic pressure between the  two agents, though in the same direction, was not significant. Plasma renin  activity did not predict the responses to either agent. Studying the prevailing  information for these two drugs one might expect there to be little difference  between them when administered once daily in terms of antihypertensive effect.  The explanation for the superiority of lisinopril may lie in the slightly longer  pharmacokinetic half-life and possibly in differences in tissue distribution or  persistence. The side effects of both drugs were mild and of similar frequency to  those recorded during placebo treatment, illustrating the generally well  tolerated nature of this class of antihypertensive therapy.

As suggested  by our previous results, the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic differences  between drugs may markedly contribute to the strength of pleiotropic effects of  ACE inhibitors. METHODS: The present study was aimed at comparing the effects of  serum- and tissue-type ACE inhibitors on monocyte release of proinflammatory  cytokines in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease. The  participants were randomized to 90-day treatment with enalapril (20 mg daily, n =  29), perindopril (4 mg daily, n = 27) or placebo (n = 28). Plasma levels of  lipids, glucose, insulin and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), as well  as monocyte release of proinflammatory cytokines were determined before and after  30 days of therapy, and at the end of the treatment. RESULTS:  Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes from normotensive patients with stable  coronary artery disease released significantly more TNF-α, interleukin-1β and  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in comparison with monocytes from 23 matched  control subjects. Their baseline hsCRP levels were also higher. Perindopril  reversed the disease-induced changes in cytokine release and reduced plasma  hsCRP, while the effect of enalapril was much more limited. The effect on both  drugs on cytokine release was stronger in insulin-resistant than  insulin-sensitive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that perindopril is  superior to enalapril in producing monocyte-suppressing and systemic  anti-inflammatory effects in normotensive patients with coronary artery disease.  This action may contribute to the clinical effectiveness of tissue ACE inhibitors  in the therapy of atherosclerosis-related disorders, particularly in  insulin-resistant subjects.","2012","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:25:32","","1466-1475","","6","64","","Pharmacol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 23406757","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Analysis of Variance; Time Factors; Insulin Resistance; Treatment Outcome; Cells, Cultured; Biomarkers/blood; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Chi-Square Distribution; Cytokines/*blood; Lipids/blood; Inflammation Mediators/*blood; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Poland; *Blood Pressure; Coronary Artery Disease/blood/*drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology; Enalapril/*therapeutic use; Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology; Perindopril/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are often characterized by a low (often  lower than 50%) trough: peak ratio but no direct drug comparisons are available.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the absolute blood pressure reduction and the trough: peak  ratio of daily doses of two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 5 mg  ramipril and 10 mg enalapril. METHOD: After a 1-month wash-out and a 2-week  placebo run-in, 25 mild hypertensives aged 47 +/- 4 years (17 men and eight  women) were randomly assigned to treatments separated by a 2-week interval.  Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed and trough: peak ratio was  calculated by the fast Fourier transform analysis of placebo-effect-subtracted  data. RESULTS: After 1 month of ramipril treatment, 24 h blood pressure decreased  from 139 +/- 10 to 129 +/- 11 mmHg for systolic (P < 0.05) and from 89 +/- 8 to  81 +/- 5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01). Also enalapril treatment  caused a significant 24 h reduction in blood pressure both for systolic (to 132  +/- 7 mmHg, P < 0.05) and for diastolic blood pressure (to 84 +/- 5 mmHg, P <  0.05). Placebo caused a 24 h reduction in blood pressure (to 136 +/- 8 mmHg for  systolic and 87 +/- 5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, NS, versus wash-out  period). The two drugs were equally effective in reducing ambulatory blood  pressure, but ramipril produced a trough: peak ratio significantly higher than  that with enalapril both for systolic (48 +/- 11%, range 34-74%, versus 38 +/-  11%, range 21-67%, P < 0.005)and for diastolic blood pressure (47 +/- 11%, range  30-79 %, versus 37 +/- 12%, range 21-68%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The low trough :  peak ratios could have been due to the daily pattern of blood pressure of mild  hypertensives, many of whom are normotensives at night-time, so that the main  antihypertensive effect is exerted during daytime rather than during the night or  early morning.","1997-12","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:26:34","","283-287","","6","2","","Blood Press Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10234131","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has the unique  advantage over other ACE inhibitors in causing a lower incidence of dry cough.  After oral administration, imidapril is rapidly converted in the liver to its  active metabolite imidaprilat. The plasma levels of imidaprilat gradually  increase in proportion to the dose, and decline slowly. The time to reach the  maximum plasma concentration (T(max)) is 2.0 h for imidapril and 9.3 h for  imidaprilat. The elimination half-lives (t(1/2)) of imidapril and imidaprilat is  1.7 and 14.8 h, respectively. Imidapril and its metabolites are excreted chiefly  in the urine. As an ACE inhibitor, imidaprilat is as potent as enalaprilat, an  active metabolite of enalapril, and about twice as potent as captopril. In  patients with hypertension, blood pressure was still decreased at 24 h after  imidapril administration. The antihypertensive effect of imidapril was  dose-dependent. The maximal reduction of blood pressure and plasma ACE was  achieved with imidapril, 10 mg once daily, and the additional effect was not  prominent with higher doses. When administered to patients with AMI, imidapril  improved left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced plasma brain natriuretic  peptide (BNP) levels. In patients with mild-to-moderate CHF [New York Heart  Association (NYHA) functional class II-III], imidapril increased exercise time  and physical working capacity and decreased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide  (ANP) and BNP levels in a dose-related manner. In patients with diabetic  nephropathy, imidapril decreased urinary albumin excretion. Interestingly,  imidapril improved asymptomatic dysphagia in patients with a history of stroke.  In the same patients it increased serum substance P levels, while the angiotensin  II receptor antagonist losartan was ineffective. These studies indicate that  imidapril is a versatile ACE inhibitor. In addition to its effectiveness in the  treatment of hypertension, CHF, and AMI, imidapril has beneficial effects in the  treatment of diabetic nephropathy and asymptomatic dysphagia. Good tissue  penetration and inhibition of tissue ACE by imidapril contributes to its  effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. The  major advantages of imidapril are its activity in the treatment of various  cardiovascular diseases and lower incidence of cough compared with some of the  older ACE inhibitors.","2002","2023-10-27 11:21:12","2023-10-27 14:24:31","","93-110","","2","20","","Cardiovasc Drug Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12177688","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cardiovascular Diseases/*drug therapy; Cardiomegaly/drug therapy; Hypertension/drug therapy; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Kidney Failure, Chronic/drug therapy; Deglutition Disorders/drug therapy; *Imidazolidines; Imidazoles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Arrhythmias, Cardiac/drug therapy; Myocardial Ischemia/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It lowers peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.  Enalapril 10 to 40 mg/day administered either once or twice daily is effective in  lowering blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension,  and shows similar efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide,  beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and captopril. Most patients  achieve adequate blood pressure control on enalapril alone or with  hydrochlorothiazide. In patients with severe congestive heart failure resistant  to conventional therapy, enalapril improves cardiac performance by a reduction in  both preload and afterload, and improves clinical status long term. Enalapril  appears to be well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported. It  does not induce the bradycardia associated with beta-blockers or the adverse  effects of diuretics on some laboratory values. In fact, the hypokalaemic effect  of hydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the addition of enalapril. The incidence  of the main (but rare) side effects of hypotension in hypovolaemic patients and  reduced renal function in certain patients with renovascular hypertension, which  are also seen with captopril, might be reduced by careful dosage titration,  discontinuation of diuretics, and monitoring of at-risk patients. Thus, enalapril  is a particularly worthwhile addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium, as  an alternative for treatment of all grades of essential and renovascular  hypertension. It also shows promise in the treatment of congestive heart failure.","1986-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","198-248","","3","31","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3011386","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Drug Interactions; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Enalapril/administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology/poisoning/therapeutic use; Kallikreins/physiology; Kinins/physiology; Prostaglandins/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In patients with symptomatic heart failure, enalapril reduces  overall mortality, death from progressive heart failure and hospitalisation  rates. In those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, enalapril  decreases the combined risk of death and development of heart failure, and the  risk of death and hospitalisation. The effects of enalapril in reducing  hospitalisation rates in symptomatic patients translate into net savings in  healthcare costs in heart failure. Enalapril also produces modest benefits in  quality-of-life (QOL) parameters in patients with symptomatic heart failure as  shown in well controlled studies. Its effects appear similar to those of  hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate. The influence of enalapril on quality of  life in patients with asymptomatic disease is minimal but not deleterious.  Enalapril generally either maintains or slightly improves quality of life from  baseline in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The drug appears to have  a QOL profile that is more favourable than that of propranolol and similar to  those of most other comparator drugs, as assessed by subjective measures of  quality of life. Clarification is required of its QOL profile relative to that of  captopril, in view of conflicting results in the literature. The effects of  enalapril on cognitive and psychomotor function appear to resemble those of  comparator agents. Thus, enalapril has modest beneficial effects on the quality  of life of patients with symptomatic heart failure, while generally maintaining  quality of life in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or  mild to moderate hypertension. Enalapril is a cost-effective treatment in heart  failure that would be expected to yield considerable cost savings in this  therapeutic area.","1994-08","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","155-182","","2","6","","Pharmacoeconomics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 10147441","","","","Humans; Treatment Outcome; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drug Therapy, Combination; Exercise; *Quality of Life; Hypertension/*drug therapy/epidemiology; *Economics, Pharmaceutical; *Enalapril/economics/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated the effects of enalapril on the pharmacokinetics and  urinary excretion of metformin in rats, with a focus on transporter-mediated drug  interactions. Rats were dosed orally with metformin alone (100 mg/kg) or in  combination with enalapril (4 mg/kg). The concentration of metformin was measured  by high performance liquid chromatography and the level of organic cation  transporters (rOCTs) and multidrug and toxin excretion protein 1 (rMATE1), which  mediate the uptake and efflux of metformin, respectively, were evaluated by  immunoblotting. After single and 7-day dosing, the plasma concentration of  metformin in the co-administration group was significantly lower than that in the  metformin-only group, and the CL/F and urinary excretion were increased in the  co-administration group. Enalapril did not affect the K(p) of metformin but  reduced renal slice-uptake of metformin. The expression of rMATE1 was increased,  whereas rOCT2 expression was decreased in rat kidney. Importantly, long-term  co-administration of metformin and enalapril markedly decreased the level of  lactic acid and uric acid in the blood. Enalapril increases the urinary excretion  of metformin through the up-regulation of rMATE1.

In April  2007, a fixed-dose combination of the two drugs was approved in Germany for the  treatment of patients not responding to monotherapy. It is expected that the drug  will soon be available in the other European Union markets. In this review the  present literature is summarized. Two doses will be available with 10 mg  lercanidipine each and 10 or 20 mg enalapril. The medication should be taken once  daily, optimally =15 minutes before a meal and the consumption of grapefruit  juice should be avoided. The fixed-dose combination of the two drugs has a  stronger blood pressure-lowering effect than monotherapy with 20 mg enalapril or  10 mg lercanidipine. The combination is well tolerated and few patients stopped  the treatment because of side effects. As expected, the most common side effects  reported are cough, peripheral edema, flushing, dizziness and vertigo, occurring  in 1-5% of patients. This new fixed-dose combination is a useful adjunct to the  present treatment and should increase compliance and help reduce  hypertension-related costs.","2008-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","261-270","","4","44","","Drugs Today (Barc)","","","","","","","","eng","2008 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 18536784","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Drug Combinations; Hypertension/*drug therapy; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Calcium Channel Blockers/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Dihydropyridines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; *Enalapril/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results demonstrate that the spontaneous oxidation of  captopril, enalapril and lisinopril followed first-order degradation kinetics in  McIlvaine's citrate-phosphate buffer. The degradation rates for enalapril and  lisinopril were much slower than that for captopril. With the former two ACE  inhibitors, the first-order rate constants of breakdown in the presence of dermal  homogenate were not significantly different from the control values. Intestinal  homogenate increased the decomposition of both of these inhibitors when compared  to the enzyme-free control systems. On the other hand, the first-order rates of  disappearance of captopril in the presence of both dermal and intestinal  homogenates were lower than in the enzyme-free system. The extent of reduction  was proportional to the amount of homogenate added. This suggests that tissue  homogenates prevent the oxidation of captopril to its disulphide dimer. Transport  experiments show that the amounts of ACE inhibitors transferred from solution on  the mucosal side increased linearly with incubation time over the 2 hr of study.  The rates of transfer from the mucosal side to the serosal side had the following  rank order: captopril > enalapril > lisinopril roughly in the ratio 1:1.13:1.27.  Addition of harmaline caused a significant reduction in the transfer rate of  captopril compared to the control system, which strongly suggests that captopril  is transported by a sodium-dependent carrier-mediated process across intestinal  tissue.","1994-03-29","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1121-1126","","7","47","","Biochem Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8161340","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Wistar; Biological Transport, Active; Drug Stability; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; *Intestinal Absorption; Captopril/*metabolism; Enalapril/*metabolism; Lisinopril/*metabolism; Skin/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a few data sets regarding enalapril, its metabolite enalaprilat  and carvedilol in children have been published, pharmacokinetic data on  carvedilol metabolites are missing. However, for both drug substances, their  active metabolites contribute substantially to drug efficacy. As data can hardly  be derived from adults owing to the unknown impacts of enzymatic maturation and  ontogeny during childhood, customised assays are important to facilitate  paediatric evidence-based pharmacotherapy. Considering ethical paediatric  constraints, a low-volume liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed using whole blood or plasma for the quantification  of enalapril, enalaprilat, carvedilol, O-desmethyl carvedilol, 4- and  5-hydroxyphenyl carvedilol as well as 3- and 8-hydroxy carvedilol. To facilitate  broader applications in adults, the elderly and children, a wide calibration  range-between 0.024/0.049 and 50.000 ng/ml-was achieved with good linearity (r ≥  0.995 for all analytes). In compliance with international bioanalytical  guidelines, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and internal standard normalised  matrix effects were further successfully validated with the exception of those  for 3-hydroxy carvedilol, which was therefore assessed semi-quantitatively.  Distinct haematocrits did not impact matrix effects or recoveries when analysing  whole blood. Blood-to-plasma ratios were determined for all analytes to form the  basis for pharmacokinetic modelling. Finally, incurred sample reanalysis of  paediatric samples confirmed the reproducibility of the developed low-volume  LC-MS/MS method during study sample analysis. The assay facilitates the reliable  generation of important data and contributes towards a safe drug therapy in  children.","2021-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","694-708","","3","13","","Drug Test Anal","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 The Authors.

The  antihypertensive effect of the optimum EnM ODTs was evaluated in vivo in  hypertensive rats and compared with commercial EnM formulation. EnM ODTs had  satisfactory results in terms of drug content and friability. Tablet wetting and  disintegration were fast and dependent on the used superdisintegrant where  croscarmellose showed the fastest wetting and disintegration time of ∼7 s. EnM  release from the tablets was rapid where complete release was obtained in  10-15 min. Selected EnM ODTs rapidly and efficiently reduced the rat's blood  pressure to its normal value within 1 h, compared with 4 h for EnM commercial  formulation.

During their simultaneous delivery to the same rat liver  preparation, the steady state hepatic extraction ratio of 14C-enalapril was high  (0.861 +/- 0.02) and 14C- enalaprilat appeared rapidly in effluent perfusate  plasma. Of the enalapril dose, 22.7 +/- 6.9% appeared in bile. 14C- Enalaprilat  accounted for 79% of the total radioactivity in bile (18% of dose) whereas  14C-enalapril was present only as 10% of the total (2.3% of dose). By contrast,  the steady state hepatic extraction of 3H- enalaprilat was very low (0.053) and  the disappearance was virtually identical to the appearance of 3H- enalaprilat in  bile. These findings suggest that diffusional barrier exists for enalaprilat as  the preformed metabolite, which hinders penetration into hepatocytes, and  therefore, elimination. The precursor, enalapril, effectively brings enalaprilat  into hepatocytes were more extensive biliary excretion of the generated  metabolite takes place. This account adds to our further understanding of  metabolite kinetics; in addition to the uneven distribution of enzyme system and  the intrinsic clearance for metabolite formation and elimination, the presence of  a diffusional barrier is another important determinant which may cause deviations  between the kinetics of a generated and performed metabolite.","1984-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","309-313","","3","12","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 6145558","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Perfusion; Biotransformation; Hydrolysis; Liver/*metabolism; Bile/metabolism; Diffusion; Enalaprilat; Dipeptides/*metabolism; Enalapril","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The in situ perfused  rat intestine preparation was used to determine the rate and extent of enalapril  absorption after an-intraduodenal dose. In the former technique, enalapril in  blood perfusate (10 ml/min) was delivered via the superior mesenteric artery into  the once-through perfused rat intestine-liver preparation, with sampling effected  in reservoir, portal vein and hepatic vein.

A review.","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)","","0890-6238","10.1016/s0890-6238(01)00161-7","","Enalapril is an antihypertensive drug of the class of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) used in pregnancy for treatment of pre-existing or  pregnancy-induced hypertension. The use of ACE inhibitors (drugs that act  directly on the renin-angiotensin system) during the second and third trimester  of pregnancy in humans is associated with specific fetal and neonatal injury. The  syndrome, termed ""ACEI fetopathy"" in humans, does not appear to have a similar  counterpart in experimental animals. The present paper reviews pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic aspects of enalapril that are physiologically important  during pregnancy and intrauterine development in humans and in experimental  animal species with the aim of better understanding the comparability of the  manifestations of enalapril developmental toxicity in animals and humans. The  human fetus is at a disadvantage with regard to in utero enalapril exposure in  comparison to some of the animal species for which gestational pharmacokinetic  data are available. Important reasons for the higher vulnerability of the human  fetus are its accessibility by enalapril and the earlier (relative to animal  species) intrauterine development of organ systems that are specific targets of  ACEI pharmacologic effect (the kidney and the renin-angiotensin system). In  humans, these systems develop prior to calcarial ossification at the end of first  trimester of pregnancy. The specific pharmacodynamic action of enalapril on these  systems during fetal life is the chief determinant of the etiology and  pathogenesis of ACEI fetopathy in humans. In contrast, in most of the studied  animal species, these target systems are not developed until close to term when  the fetus is relatively more mature (and therefore less vulnerable), so that the  window of vulnerability is narrower in comparison to the human. Among animal  species, the best concordance in fetal pharmacodynamics to the human is seen in  the rhesus monkey, but further studies are necessary to determine if similar  developmental pathology is induced in this animal model upon repeated  administration of the drug during the relevant period of intrauterine  development. Animal-human concordance of developmental toxicity is least likely  in the rat because of greater disparities in enalapril availability to the fetus  and the relative development of the kidney and skeletal ossification compared to  that in humans.","2001-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","467-478","","5","15","","Reprod Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11780954","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Animals; Models, Animal; Species Specificity; Pregnancy; Macaca mulatta; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Antihypertensive Agents/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics; Embryonic and Fetal Development/*drug effects; Enalapril/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After a single-blind,  4-week, placebo run-in phase, 527 patients (mean +/- SD age 54.5 +/- 1.2 years)  with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 101.2-101.7 mmHg were randomly assigned  to one of the three treatments for 8 weeks. The main evaluation criteria were  diastolic blood pressure and serum potassium concentration. Equivalence was  assessed on an intention-to-treat basis, using Schuirmann's method, which  involves performing two one-tailed statistical tests on the data. Thirty-five  patients were withdrawn from the study but there were no differences between  groups in the reasons for withdrawal. RESULTS: Diastolic blood pressure decreased  by between 13.1 and 14.2 mmHg in the three groups. The 90% confidence intervals  for the differences between perindopril + indapamide and the other treatments  were -1.1, +1.7 mmHg for captopril + hydrochlorothiazide and -0.4, +2.6 mmHg for  enalapril + hydrochlorothiazide.

In  single pass experiments, enalapril was primarily metabolized to its polar,  dicarboxylic acid metabolite, enalaprilat, and its fractional excretion (FE) was  less than unity, suggesting net reabsorption. Its steady-state extraction ratio  decreased from 0.3 to 0.2 at concentrations of 1.06 to 12.7 microM, due to a  saturation of enzymes for esterolysis. Enalaprilat administered to the IPK was  excreted into urine in a concentration-independent (0.41-35.3 microM) fashion,  with FE values approximating unity, suggesting net filtration. Differences in  handling were observed for enalaprilat, as a metabolite formed from enalapril and  as an administered (preformed) species in the single pass IPK, when tracer  concentrations of [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat were given simultaneously. A  comparison made between steady-state extraction ratio Ess[mi] [generated  metabolite]/glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and Ess[pmi] [preformed  metabolite]/GFR, respectively, revealed a 2-fold difference. The finding suggests  the presence of a barrier for entry of enalaprilat into the kidney. Or else, in  absence of the barrier, the opposite would be observed, that is, Ess [pmi]/GFR  greater than Ess [mi]/GFR because preformed enalaprilat, in contrast to generated  enalaprilat, undergoes filtration and utilizes facilitative transport carriers at  the basolateral membrane. In recirculating IPKs which received simultaneously a  tracer bolus dose of [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat, the FE values for  generated [14C]enalaprilat were high and variable, decreasing with perfusion time  and exceeding those for preformed [3H]enalaprilat, which approached unity with  perfusion time. The variable FE values for [14C]enalaprilat are due to  time-dependent contributions of circulating enalaprilat (which behaves  identically to preformed enalaprilat) and the intrarenally generated enalaprilat.  Hence, with renal drug metabolism, the conventional method of estimating urinary  clearance (or Fe[mi]) for the metabolite [(total) excretion rate/midpoint plasma  FE[mi] metabolite concentration] results in a greater metabolite clearance than  that predicted from the administration of preformed metabolite.","1989-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1211-1222","","3","251","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2557416","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Perfusion; Protein Binding; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Kidney/*metabolism; Blood Proteins/metabolism; Erythrocytes; p-Aminohippuric Acid/pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/*pharmacokinetics; Enalaprilat/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This cannot be explained by changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin  concentrations. Angiotensin converting enzyme may also metabolise vasoactive  intestinal peptide (VIP), a vasodilator and positive inotrope whose concentration  in the heart declines in heart failure. We sought to determine whether changes in  plasma VIP or its metabolism might explain the positive inotropic effect of  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. We also measured VIP in the heart to  determine whether a local increase in VIP might explain this effect. Male  Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised to control and enalapril groups (2 mg kg(-1)  day(-1)). After 7 days, rats were anaesthetised and underwent metabolic clearance  studies for VIP or had hearts, lungs and kidneys removed and snap frozen. VIP  concentrations in plasma, infusate and tissue extracts were measured by  radioimmunoassay. Plasma concentrations of VIP were unchanged by treatment with  enalapril (control: 7.7 +/- 0.8 pmol l(-1); enalapril: 7.9 +/- 0.8 pmol l(-1) ),  while the metabolic clearance rate of) VIP increased significantly (control: 10.4  +/- 1.4 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1); enalapril: 17.3 +/- 1.6 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1); p <  0.005).

Enalapril is rapidly converted by ester  hydrolysis to enalaprilat, a potent ACE inhibitor; enalapril itself is only a  weak ACE inhibitor. Enalapril lowers peripheral vascular resistance without  causing an increase in heart rate. In patients with congestive heart failure,  enalapril has beneficial hemodynamic effects based on reduction of both cardiac  preload and afterload. Approximately 60% of a dose of enalapril is absorbed after  oral administration. Excretion of enalaprilat is primarily renal. Accumulation of  enalaprilat occurs in patients with creatinine clearances less than 30 mL/min.  Enalapril 10-40 mg per day orally has shown efficacy comparable to that of  captopril in treating patients with mild, moderate, and severe hypertension,  hypertension caused by renal-artery stenosis, and in congestive heart failure  resistant to digitalis and diuretics. When given alone for hypertension,  enalapril has efficacy comparable to that of thiazide diuretics and beta  blockers. Side effects observed with enalapril have generally been minor.  Captopril-associated side effects such as skin rash, loss of taste, and  proteinuria have been observed in a small number of patients receiving enalapril  to date; neutropenia less than 300/mm3 has been noted with captopril but not  enalapril. The incidence of these side effects has been noted to be greatly  decreased in patients on low doses of captopril.

Indeed, the pharmacokinetics of many of the drugs used to  treat CHF are significantly altered by the patient's underlying condition.  Reduced gastric emptying in CHF delays absorption and decreases the peak plasma  concentrations of furosemide, bumetanide, and digoxin. Moreover, drugs that have  a high hepatic extraction ratio (organic nitrates, morphine, prazosin, and  hydralazine) achieve higher than expected plasma concentrations in patients with  CHF. In contrast, drugs requiring biotransformation to active forms, e.g.,  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as enalapril, perindopril,  quinapril, and ramipril, generally have lower than expected plasma  concentrations. Nevertheless, ACE inhibitors can impair renal function in CHF,  leading to an actual increase in plasma concentrations. However, decreases in  absorption and first-pass metabolism are often offset by reduced hepatic and  renal clearance. The overall absorption of lisinopril may be reduced in some CHF  patients; consequently, the onset of effect is delayed but is often more  prolonged.","1992-10-08","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","109C-112C","","10","70","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1329465","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Biological Availability; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Dipeptides/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/metabolism; Lisinopril","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study used micropuncture  techniques to examine the effect of these two treatments on albumin permeation  (by measuring the delivery of albumin to the proximal tubule) and the tubular  absorption of albumin. PHN rats (12-18 days after injection of FX1A) were  switched from 23% to either 40% protein diet (HP), 40% protein diet and  concomitantly treated with enalapril (40 mg.kg-1.day-1) (HPE), or to 8% (LP)  protein diet for 4-6 days. Although left kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  did not differ among the groups, UAlbV from the left kidney in LP and HPE was  only 20-40% of that observed for the HP group. In protocol 1, the fractional  recovery of albumin (FRAlb) in urine was calculated following injection of  artificial tubular fluid containing [14C]inulin and 125I-labeled albumin into the  earliest identifiable proximal loops. There were no differences in FRAlb among  the three groups. In protocol 2, timed quantitative collections of tubular fluid  were obtained from proximal tubular loops. The rate of albumin delivery to the  earliest accessible loops of the proximal tubule was significantly lower for the  LP and HPE groups compared with the HP group. For each group, albumin  concentration corrected for water absorption was not altered along the proximal  tubule. The data indicate that alterations of dietary protein intake or ACEI  treatment results in large changes in the delivery of albumin at the proximal  tubule that could singularly account for the changes in urinary albumin  excretion.","1996-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","F986-996","","6 Pt 2","270","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8764318","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Osmolar Concentration; Albuminuria/metabolism; Microinjections; Enalapril/*pharmacology; Absorption/drug effects; Glomerulonephritis/*metabolism; Dietary Proteins/*pharmacology; Albumins/*metabolism; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*drug effects/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

R.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a comparative review.","DICP : the annals of pharmacotherapy","","1042-9611","10.1177/106002809002400512","","The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and dosages of the three currently available angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are  reviewed. This class of agents effectively inhibits the conversion of angiotensin  I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, a hormone that also promotes, via  aldosterone stimulation, increased sodium and water retention. The ACE  inhibitors, therefore, are capable of lowering blood pressure primarily by  promoting vasodilatation and reducing intravascular fluid volume. Captopril, the  first orally active, commercially available ACE inhibitor, is a  sulfhydryl-containing compound. Captopril was followed by the introduction of  enalapril and lisinopril, two non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitors. The pharmacokinetic  profiles of these three ACE inhibitors differ. Captopril has rapid onset with  relatively short duration of action, whereas enalapril and lisinopril have slower  onset and relatively long duration of action. Captopril is an active ACE  inhibitor in its orally absorbable parent form. In contrast, enalapril must be  deesterified in the liver to the metabolite enalaprilat in order to inhibit the  converting enzyme; this accounts for its delayed onset of action. Lisinopril does  not require metabolic activation to be effective; however, a slow and incomplete  absorption pattern explains the delay in onset of activity. Captopril and its  disulfide metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine with minor elimination  in the feces. Approximately two-thirds of an administered enalapril dose is  excreted in the urine as both the parent drug and the metabolite enalaprilat; the  remainder of these two substances are excreted in the feces. Lisinopril does not  undergo measurable metabolism and approximately one-third is excreted unchanged  in the urine with the remaining parent drug being excreted in the feces. The ACE  inhibitors lower systemic vascular resistance with a resultant decrease in blood  pressure. Their efficacy is comparable to diuretics and beta-blockers in treating  patients with mild, moderate, or severe essential and renovascular hypertension.  In those patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) the ACE inhibitors  produce a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary  capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure. These drugs may produce  improvement in cardiac output and stroke volume and, with chronic administration,  may promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The antihypertensive  effects of the ACE inhibitors are enhanced when these agents are combined with a  diuretic. Captopril and enalapril have been shown to be of particular benefits as  adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure, both in terms of  subjective improvement of patient symptoms, and in improving overall hemodynamic  status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-05","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","506-525","","5","24","","DICP","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2188439","","","","Humans; Animals; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enalapril, a  prodrug, is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterases to the active angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. Enalapril as the maleate salt is shown to be highly  soluble, but only 60%-70% of an orally administered dose of enalapril is absorbed  from the gastrointestinal tract into the enterocytes. Consequently, enalapril  maleate is a Biopharmaceutics Classification System class III substance. Because  in situ conversion of the maleate salt to the sodium salt is sometimes used in  production of the finished drug product, not every enalapril maleate-labeled  finished product actually contains the maleate salt. Enalapril is not considered  to have a narrow therapeutic index. With this background, a biowaiver-based  approval procedure for new generic products or after major revisions to existing  products is deemed acceptable, provided the in vitro dissolution of both test and  reference preparation is very rapid (at least 85% within 15 min at pH 1.2, 4.5,  and 6.8).

Interactions involving specific ACE inhibitors include captopril-digoxin,  resulting in decreased clearance of digoxin from plasma in patients with heart  failure, and captopril-probenecid, causing a decrease in captopril clearance.  Tissue kinins, such as bradykinin, are metabolised by ACE inhibitors.  Interactions involving bradykinin include captopril-indomethacin, in which an  attenuation of the antihypertensive effects of captopril is manifest.

ACE inhibitors currently  approved for use in veterinary medicine are benazepril, enalapril, imidapril and  ramipril. They are all pro-drugs administered by oral route. A physiologically  based model taking into account the saturable binding to ACE has been developed  for pharmacokinetic analysis. The bioavailability of the active compounds from  their respective pro-drug is low. The active metabolites are eliminated by renal,  hepatorenal or biliary excretion, according to the drug. The elimination  half-life of the free fraction of the active compounds is very short (ranging  from approximately 10 min to 2 h). ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated.  Benazepril, enalapril, imidapril and ramipril are approved for dogs with chronic  heart failure (CHF). The efficacy of ACE inhibitors has been convincingly  demonstrated in dogs with CHF, especially in those with chronic valvular disease.  In such clinical settings, ACE inhibitors improve hemodynamics and clinical  signs, and increase survival time. In cats with cardiovascular disease, little  information is available except for reports of some benefit in cats with  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two non-controlled investigations. ACE inhibitors  have also a mild to moderate hypotensive effect. There is also evidence to  recommend ACE inhibitors in dogs and cats with chronic renal failure (CRF).

Twenty-four hours following the administration of EN (1.5 to 1.8 g/kg), increased  serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and hepatic necrosis were observed.  Pretreatment of the animals with pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, a selective  inducer of the cytochrome P450IIIA gene subfamily, enhanced EN-induced  hepatotoxicity, whereas pretreatment with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, cobalt  protoporphyrin, reduced the liver injury. Depletion of hepatic non-protein  sulfhydryls (NPSHs), an indicator of GSH, by combined treatment with buthionine  sulfoximine (BSO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) produced marked elevations in serum  transaminases by 6 hr after EN treatment. Administered on its own, EN decreased  hepatic NPSH content and when combined with the BSO/DEM pretreatment, the liver  was nearly completely devoid of NPSHs. Protection from EN-induced hepatotoxicity  was observed in animals administered L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a  cysteine precursor. Together, these observations suggest the involvement of  cytochrome P450 in EN bioactivation and GSH in detoxification. The results  corroborate previous in vitro observations pertaining to the mechanism of  EN-induced cytotoxicity towards primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.

Models of hepatic drug clearances have been  appraised with respect to their utility in predicting drug removal by the liver.  Among these models, the ""well-stirred"" model is the simplest since it assumes  venous equilibration, with drug emerging from the outflow being in equilibrium  with drug within the liver, and the concentration is the same throughout. The  ""parallel tube"" and dispersion models, and distributed model of Goresky and  co-workers have been used to account for the observed sinusoidal concentration  gradient from the inlet and outlet. Departure from these models exists to include  heterogeneity in flow, enzymes, and transporters. This article utilized the  physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) liver model and its extension that  include heterogeneity in enzymes and transporters to illustrate how in vitro  uptake and metabolic data from zonal hepatocytes on transport and enzymes may be  used to predict the kinetics of removal in the intact liver; binding data were  also necessary. In doing so, an integrative platform was provided to examine  determinants of hepatic drug clearance. We used enalapril and digoxin as  examples, and described a simple liver PBPK model that included transmembrane  transport and metabolism occurring behind the membrane, and a zonal model in  which the PBPK model was expanded three sets of sub-compartments that are  arranged sequentially to represent zones 1, 2, and 3 along the flow path. The  latter model readily accommodated the heterogeneous distribution of hepatic  enzymes and transporters. Transport and metabolic data, piecewise information  that served as initial estimates, allowed for the unknown efflux and other  intrinsic clearances to be estimated. The simple or zonal PBPK model provides  predictive views on the hepatic removal of drugs and metabolites.","2006-11","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","215-230","","3-4","29","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 16806855","","","","Humans; Animals; Models, Biological; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Computer Simulation; Liver/*metabolism; Digoxin/pharmacokinetics; Bile/metabolism; Enalapril/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ensure interchangeability between a brand-name and generic or  similar drugs is necessary that they are bioequivalent. With the growing number  of generic drugs, it is common for patients to replace a generic to another or  one similar. However, this exchange can not guarantee the maintenance of  bioequivalence. To evaluate the safety interchangeability between different  generic and similar drugs with Hydrochlorothiazide and Enalapril Maleate, a  meta-analysis was carried out with several bioequivalence studies with these  drugs. METHODS: Data from bioequivalence of generic and similar drugs approved by  the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) (drug regulatory agency in  Brazil) were used. The compatibility of data from each study was analyzed and the  determination of a confidence interval for the differences between the means of  pharmacokinetic parameters, area under the curve (ASC0-t) and maximum plasma  concentration (Cmax), was made for each study by meta-analysis. RESULTS: The  interchangeability between the combinations of the three products with  Hydrochlorothiazide was confirmed based on the obtained confidence intervals. For  the drugs studied with Enalapril Maleate interchangeability has not been  confirmed for 50% of the product comparisons. CONCLUSION: The exchange was  established between the three products with hydrochlorothiazide. However, for the  Enalapril Maleate half of the products studied are not interchangeable,  considering they do not match the established intervals for bioequivalence tests,  so the pharmacokinetics behavior and thus the effectiveness of the product may be  changed.","2010-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","173-181","","2","32","","J Bras Nefrol","","","","","","","","por","","","","","","","Place: Brazil PMID: 21103677","","","","Humans; Therapeutic Equivalency; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/*pharmacokinetics; *Drug Substitution; Hydrochlorothiazide/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the metabolism of hepatic arterially  delivered enalapril, swept into the rat liver by the portal or hepatic venous  flow (HAPV and HAHV perfusion), was more abundant in the perivenous (PV) than the  periportal (PP) region. Hence, metabolic activities toward enalapril in 9000g  supernatant (S9) fractions of enriched rat PP and PV hepatocytes were examined.  Although Michaelis-Menten kinetics were invariably observed, the metabolic  activity toward enalapril (intrinsic clearance or V(max)(met)/K(m)(met) of 0.008  ml/min/mg of S9 protein, V(max)(met) of 21 +/- 6 nmol/min/mg of S9 protein, and  K(m)(met) of 2612 +/- 236 microM) was greater in PV than in PP (V(max)(met) of  5.5 +/- 3.1 nmol/min/mg of S9 protein and K(m)(met) of 1049 +/- 335 microM;  intrinsic clearance of 0.0052 ml/min/mg of S9 protein) hepatocytes. These  metabolic intrinsic clearances were much lower than the sinusoidal influx  clearances observed from previous transport studies, revealing metabolism as the  rate-limiting step. Substitution of the scaled-up transport and metabolic  intrinsic clearances into the ""well stirred"", ""parallel-tube"", and ""dispersion""  models predicted higher steady-state extraction ratios for HAHV perfusion. By  contrast, integration of the scaled-up in vitro parameters on zonal metabolism  and homogeneous transport into a ""zonal-compartment"" model of three zonal  subcompartments (1, 2, and 3) provided an improved description of the extraction  ratios during HAPV and HAHV.

METHODS: The effects of ACE inhibitors on  antiepileptic drugs were examined in the mouse model of maximal electroshock.  RESULTS: Enalapril (30 mg/kg ip) potentiated the anticonvulsant action of LTG,  decreasing its ED50 value from 5.3 to 3.6 mg/kg (p < 0.01). The anticonvulsant  activity of TPM or OXC was not modified by enalapril. Cilazapril did not affect  the protective activity of the studied antiepileptics. The interaction between  enalapril and LTG could be pharmacodynamic in nature because enalapril did not  change plasma and total brain concentrations of LTG. CONCLUSIONS: This study  shows that there are no negative interactions between the studied antiepileptic  drugs and enalapril or cilazapril.

The antihypertensive efficacy of nilvadipine appears to be comparable with that  of nicardipine and nitrendipine, enalapril and captopril and  hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene, although further clinical experience is required  to establish the claimed advantages nilvadipine may have over the other  dihydropyridine derivatives currently used to treat hypertension. Preliminary  studies suggest that nilvadipine may also be useful in the treatment of patients  with stable exertional or variant angina. Studies conducted in Japan indicate  that nilvadipine improves symptoms resulting from cerebral infarction in some  patients, but further comparative studies are required to confirm these results.  The tolerability of nilvadipine appears to be comparable with that of nicardipine  and better than that of nifedipine with respect to flushes, oedema and liver  function abnormalities. As is typical of calcium antagonists, there is no  evidence of tolerance to the antihypertensive effects of nilvadipine. The drug is  equally effective in treating hypertension in elderly and younger patients and  does not appear to adversely affect glucose or lipid metabolism. Thus, provided  its apparently good tolerability is confirmed by wider clinical experience, it  should be a suitable alternative to other calcium antagonists when used alone or  in conjunction with other drugs for the majority of patients with mild to  moderate hypertension.","1995-02","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","150-171","","2","6","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7711361","","","","Humans; Animals; Angina Pectoris/*drug therapy; Aging/metabolism; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Cerebrovascular Disorders/*drug therapy; Nifedipine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of several important therapeutic agents, drugs of  abuse, and endogenous compounds. However, no studies have described the role of  human CES1 in the activation of two commonly prescribed angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitors: enalapril and ramipril. Here, we studied recombinant human  CES1- and CES2-mediated hydrolytic activation of the prodrug esters enalapril and  ramipril, compared with the activation of the known substrate trandolapril.  Enalapril, ramipril, and trandolapril were readily hydrolyzed by CES1, but not by  CES2. Ramipril and trandolapril exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while  enalapril demonstrated substrate inhibition kinetics. Intrinsic clearances were  1.061, 0.360, and 0.02 ml/min/mg protein for ramipril, trandolapril, and  enalapril, respectively. Additionally, we screened a panel of therapeutic drugs  and drugs of abuse to assess their inhibition of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl  acetate by recombinant CES1 and human liver microsomes. The screening assay  confirmed several known inhibitors of CES1 and identified two previously  unreported inhibitors: the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, isradipine, and  the immunosuppressive agent, tacrolimus. CES1 plays a role in the metabolism of  several drugs used in the treatment of common conditions, including hypertension,  congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus; thus, there is a potential for  clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The findings in the present study may  contribute to the prediction of such interactions in humans, thus opening up  possibilities for safer drug treatments.","2014-01","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","126-133","","1","42","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24141856","","","","Humans; Kinetics; Hydrolysis; Liver/enzymology/metabolism; Microsomes, Liver/enzymology/metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism; Drug Interactions/physiology; Nitrophenols/metabolism; Prodrugs/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism; Carboxylesterase/metabolism; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/*metabolism; Diltiazem/metabolism; Enalapril/metabolism; Esters/metabolism; Inactivation, Metabolic/*physiology; Indoles/metabolism; Ramipril/metabolism; Verapamil/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, titrated low  doses of captopril used alone or in conjunction with a diuretic are similar in  efficacy to usual doses of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or  beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, as well as to the other ACE inhibitors. In  addition, captopril improved well-being to a greater extent than methyldopa or  propranolol in a study designed specifically to determine the effect of treatment  on the quality of life of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension.  The earlier demonstrated efficacy of captopril, used with a diuretic and often  also with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, in the treatment of severe  hypertension refractory to conventional 'triple therapy' has been confirmed in  more recent trials which illustrate the generally marked antihypertensive effect  of captopril-containing regimens in such patients. Results of initial trials in  patients with scleroderma are promising, with control of hypertension and  stabilization of renal function in these patients when treated at an early stage  of the disease. Several comparative and long term trials of captopril in patients  with chronic congestive heart failure refractory to treatment with a  diuretic/digitalis regimen clearly demonstrate that initial haemodynamic  improvement is maintained and correlates with clinical benefit. A tendency for  overall clinical response to captopril to be better than the response to  prazosin, hydralazine, nisoldipine or enalapril has been reported. Results of a  multicentre comparison with digoxin and placebo indicate that captopril is a  suitable alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate heart failure  who are receiving maintenance diuretic therapy. The tolerability of captopril has  now been studied in many thousands of patients involved in formalized trials and  the early impression of poor tolerability can no longer be justified. The use of  generally lower dosages of captopril in patients with normal or slightly impaired  renal function has resulted in a generally low incidence of rash (0.5 to 4%),  dysgeusia (0.1 to 3%), proteinuria (0.5%), neutropenia (0.3% during first 3  months) and symptomatic hypotension (0.1 to 3%).

A guide to selection.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199549040-00003","","To find out if there are one or more criteria to guide selection among the ACE inhibitors for the treatment of arterial hypertension, we have reviewed the  principal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of the more frequently used  agents of this class of antihypertensive drugs. Among the pharmacokinetic aspects  that we have considered, terminal half-life, as related to the duration of the  antihypertensive effect, and the route of elimination may have an impact in the  clinical selection among the various ACE inhibitors. On the other hand, all the  other characteristics have no pragmatic clinical relevance or may be corrected by  dosage adjustment. Among the pharmacodynamic aspects, the antihypertensive  efficacy of the different ACE inhibitors seems to be very similar, and some of  the differences found in different studies are probably due to the population  investigated and to the protocol of the study (time of blood pressure  measurements, diet, drug dosage etc.). However, some differences can be found  among the various ACE inhibitors when the antihypertensive efficacy is evaluated  also as trough to peak ratio of blood pressure reduction. Indeed, in respect of  the administration schedule of each ACE inhibitor not all the agents of this  class have a trough to peak ratio above 50 to 60%, as suggested by the Food and  Drug Administration of the US. According to this criterion, especially when blood  pressure is measured with 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure  monitoring, some drugs such as lisinopril, enalapril and trandolapril should be  preferred for their higher trough to peak ratios. Left ventricular hypertrophy is  significantly reduced by antihypertensive agents, the ACE inhibitors being the  most effective. Indeed, the reduction of left ventricle mass for each 1 mm Hg  reduction in mean blood pressure is greater for ACE inhibitors than for other  classes of antihypertensive agents. However, this effect seems more class related  than characteristic of one or more among the various ACE inhibitors. Insulin  resistance is elevated in hypertensive patients and it has been thought  responsible for or associated with other metabolic abnormalities. ACE inhibitors  seem to correct the insulin resistance of hypertensive patients, but this effect  also appears to be class related more than limited to one ACE inhibitor or  another. Our knowledge of this field is still limited and more studies are  necessary, especially to understand the prognostic impact of insulin resistance  and/or insulin resistance improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1995-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","516-535","","4","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7789286","","","","Humans; Aged; Insulin Resistance; Ligands; Quality of Life; Proteinuria; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics; Arteriosclerosis/drug therapy; Zinc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of its pharmacology and clinical efficacy in the early management of acute myocardial infarction.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199652040-00011","","Following establishment of its efficacy in hypertension and congestive heart failure, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril has now been shown to reduce mortality and  cardiovascular morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction when administered  as early treatment. The ability of lisinopril to attenuate the detrimental  effects of left ventricular remodelling is a key mechanism; however, additional  cardioprotective and vasculoprotective actions are postulated to play a role in  mediating the early benefit. The GISSI-3 trial in > 19 000 patients has  demonstrated that, when given orally within 24 hours of symptom onset and  continued for 6 weeks, lisinopril (with or without nitrates) produces measurable  survival benefits within 1 to 2 days of starting treatment. Compared with no  lisinopril treatment, reductions of 11% in risk of mortality and 7.7% in a  combined end-point (death plus severe left ventricular dysfunction) were evident  at 6 weeks. Advantages were apparent in all types of patients. Thus, those at  high risk-women, the elderly, patients with diabetes mellitus and those with  anterior infarct and/or Killip class > 1 -also benefited. These gains in combined  end-point events persisted in the longer term, despite treatment withdrawal after  6 weeks in most patients. At 6 months, the incidence rate for the combined  end-point remained lower than with control (a 6.2% reduction). The GISSI-3  results concur with those from recent large investigations (ISIS-4, CCS-1, SMILE)  of other ACE inhibitors as early management in myocardial infarction. However,  the results of the CONSENSUS II trial (using intravenous enalaprilat then oral  enalapril) were unfavourable in some patients. These findings, together with the  development of persistent hypotension and, to a lesser extent, renal dysfunction  among patients in the GISSI-3 trial, have prompted considerable debate over  optimum treatment strategies. Present opinion generally holds that therapy with  lisinopril or other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial may be started within  24 hours in haemodynamically stable patients with no other contraindications;  current labelling in the US and other countries reflects this position. There is  virtually unanimous agreement that such therapy is indicated in high-risk  patients, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. The choice of ACE  inhibitor appears less important than the decision to treat; it seems likely that  these benefits are a class effect. Lisinopril has a tolerability profile  resembling that of other ACE inhibitors, can be given once daily and may be less  costly than other members of its class. However, present cost analyses are flawed  and this latter points remains to be proven in formal cost-effectiveness  analyses. In conclusion, early treatment with lisinopril (within 24 hours of  symptom onset) for 6 weeks improves survival and reduces cardiovascular morbidity  in patients with myocardial infarction, and confers ongoing benefit after drug  withdrawal. While patients with symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction are  prime candidates for treatment, all those who are haemodynamically stable with no  other contraindications are also eligible to receive therapy. Lisinopril and  other ACE inhibitors shown to be beneficial should therefore be considered an  integral part of the early management of myocardial infarction in suitable  patients.","1996-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","564-588","","4","52","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8891468","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Administration, Oral; Treatment Outcome; Tissue Distribution; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Absorption; Drug Tolerance; Kidney Function Tests; Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects; Capillary Permeability/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Cardiotonic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Lisinopril/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Myocardial Infarction/*drug therapy/mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As modeling and simulation  techniques are becoming increasingly utilized in cardiovascular research, our aim  was to develop a physiology-based model that describes the effect of different  drugs at different doses on the RAAS and integrates physiology-based description  drug pharmacokinetics (PK). First, a basic RAAS model was developed in which  equations for drug effects were included and missing parameters estimated. Next,  a physiology-based PK model for enalapril and enalaprilat was developed and  coupled to the RAAS model. Simulation of the effects of angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aliskiren administration on  angiotensins I and II did not reveal significant overestimation or  underestimation. For all drugs, the error numerics were acceptable. The model  also encompassed the PK of intravenous and oral enalapril and its conversion to  enalaprilat. In summary, we report a physiology-based model for the interaction  of the RAAS biomarkers angiotensin I and II with enalapril, benazepril,  aliskiren, and losartan that allows for an adequate description of the RAAS  response after single administration of the drugs. Such a comprehensive  description may lead to a better understanding of the effects of pharmacological  interventions in the RAAS.","2012-11","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","417-428","","5","60","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23143654","","","","Humans; Administration, Oral; Injections, Intravenous; Computer Simulation; Biomarkers/metabolism; *Models, Biological; Angiotensin II/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects/*physiology; Enalapril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Angiotensin I/*metabolism; Enalaprilat/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lisinopril, a new nonsulfhydryl  angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is absorbed in its active form.  Like the other ACE inhibitors, it lowers peripheral vascular resistance, with a  resultant decrease in blood pressure. Approximately 29% of lisinopril is absorbed  after oral administration. No measurable metabolism occurs, and excretion is  primarily renal. Accumulation of lisinopril occurs in patients with renal  dysfunction; however, dosage adjustment is necessary only when the creatinine  clearance is less than 30 mL/min. Lisinopril has been shown to be an effective  antihypertensive agent at doses of 10 to 80 mg given once daily in patients with  essential and secondary hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis. The  effectiveness of lisinopril is comparable to that with diuretics, beta blockers,  and calcium-channel antagonists. In patients who are unresponsive to maximal  doses of lisinopril alone, addition of another antihypertensive agent may be  beneficial. Limited information suggests that lisinopril may be comparable to  captopril for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Adverse effects  associated with lisinopril are relatively minor and are comparable to those  associated with enalapril. Hematological abnormalities have not been reported  with lisinopril. Class-related adverse effects include cough, azotemia,  angioedema, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Lisinopril appears to be comparable to  other ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and may be as effective as  its predecessors for the treatment of congestive heart failure.

A toxicokinetic evaluation of EN and DTZ drug  levels during a 27-week toxicity study used an enzyme assay to measure EN and an  HPLC assay to measure DTZ, deacetylated DTZ (DAD), and desmethyl DTZ (DMD). EN  exposure during drug week 7 was proportional to dose and without dispositional  gender differences. However, gender differences in DTZ and metabolite plasma  profiles were dramatic. For example, female DTZ Cmax values were roughly 15-20%  of males; DAD plasma Cmax values were roughly 3- to 10-fold greater; and the  desmethyl metabolite, DMD, was roughly 2- to 10-fold lower. Sodium fluoride added  to samples taken during drug week 26 to inhibit plasma esterase activity did not  alter DTZ plasma profiles, suggesting that gender differences in DTZ and  metabolite plasma levels were not caused by sample degradation. Liver esterase  activity in treated rats was significantly greater (p > 0.05) than controls,  whereas plasma activity was not affected. Female plasma and liver esterase  activities were roughly 3- and 5-fold greater than males (p < 0.002),  respectively, which may explain the low DTZ and high DAD plasma levels we  measured. These results indicate that liver and plasma esterase activity is much  greater in female rats and may be responsible for the differences in drug and  metabolite plasma profiles relative to males. In addition, chronic  coadministration of EN/DTZ may modestly increase liver esterase activity.","1996-01","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","28-33","","1","24","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8825187","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sex Factors; Diltiazem/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Enalapril/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity; Esterases/*blood; Liver/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Benazepril is reported to have beneficial effects on various indices of cardiac  function and to improve clinical symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with  congestive heart failure. The tolerability of benazepril in clinical trials has  been very good, with an incidence of adverse effects similar to that observed in  placebo recipients.

An important reason for this higher  vulnerability is the earlier intrauterine development of the kidney and the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) system in humans, organ systems that are  specific targets of ACEI's pharmacological effect. In humans, these systems begin  developing prior to the onset of skeletal ossification at the end of the first  trimester, with continuing vulnerability throughout the pregnancy. In most animal  species tested, these target systems develop close to term, when the fetus is  relatively more mature and less vulnerable to the effects of developmental  toxicants. For this reason, animal studies that follow standard protocols and  evaluate developmental toxicity only for exposures during embryogenesis will miss  developmental effects arising secondary to disruption of target systems that  develop after the period of major organogenesis. Thus, although the animal mode  of action (MOA) for enalapril and other ACEI is plausible in humans, differences  in the timing of development of critical target organ systems, particularly the  renal system and RAS, explain the absence of definitive structural abnormalities  in test animals.","2005-11","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","747-755","","8-9","35","","Crit Rev Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16417042","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Pharmacokinetics; Pregnancy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; *Teratogens; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In dose-finding studies of patients with mild to severe  hypertension, spirapril > or = 6 mg once daily produced reductions in blood  pressure of approximately 10 to 18 mm Hg (systolic) and 7 to 13 mm Hg (diastolic)  [24-hour postdose trough readings at the end of the treatment period]. Blood  pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had  occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The  dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once  daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further  studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril  can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials,  spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with  enalapril or captopril. When given as monotherapy or in combination with  hydrochlorothiazide, spirapril may offer potential advantages over the calcium  antagonist nitrendipine. Spirapril is generally well tolerated and produces an  adverse event profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors. Data from small  studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients  with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance  mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a  predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active  metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in  this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data  regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective  antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are  needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and  a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in  hypertensive patients with renal failure.","1995-05","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","750-766","","5","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7601014","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we investigated (i) the  existence of the RAS components angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and  angiotensin II receptors (AT(1) and AT(2)) in the rabbit cornea using in vitro  and ex vivo models and (ii) the effect of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, to inhibit  angiogenesis in rabbit cornea in vivo. METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits were  used. Cultured corneal fibroblasts and corneal epithelial cells were used for RNA  isolation and cDNA preparation using standard molecular biology techniques. PCR  was performed to detect the presence of ACE, AT(1), and AT(2) gene expression. A  corneal micropocket assay to implant a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  pellet in the rabbit cornea was used to induce corneal angiogenesis. Rabbits of  the control group received sterile water, and the treated group received 3 mg/kg  enalapril intramuscularly once daily for 14 days starting from day 1 of pellet  implantation. The clinical eye examination was performed by slit-lamp  biomicroscopy. We monitored the level of corneal angiogenesis in live animals by  stereomicroscopy at days 4, 9, and 14 after VEGF pellet implantation. Collagen  type IV and lectin immunohistochemistry and fluorescent microscopy were used to  measure corneal angiogenesis in tissue sections of control and enalapril-treated  corneas of the rabbits. Image J software was used to quantify corneal  angiogenesis in the rabbit eye in situ. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated the  presence of ACE, AT(1), and AT(2) expression in corneal fibroblasts. Cells of  corneal epithelium expressed AT(1) and AT(2) but did not show ACE expression.  Slit-lamp examination did not show any significant difference between the degree  of edema or cellular infiltration between the corneas of control and  enalapril-treated rabbits. VEGF pellet implantation caused corneal angiogenesis  in the eyes of vehicle-treated control rabbits, and the mean area of corneal  neovascularization was 1.8, 2.8, and 3.2 mm(2) on days 4, 9, and 14,  respectively. Enalapril treatment caused a notable decrease in corneal  neovascularization of 44% (1 mm(2)), 28% (2.1 mm(2)), and 31% (2.2 mm(2)) on the  three tested time points, respectively. The immunostaining of corneal tissue  sections with collagen type IV and lectin confirmed the presence of blood  vessels, with enalapril-treated rabbit corneas showing a lesser degree of blood  vessel staining. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal cells show expression of tissue RAS  components, such as ACE, AT(1), and AT(2). Treatment with ACE inhibitor enalapril  markedly decreased corneal angiogenesis in a rabbit model of VEGF-induced corneal  neovascularization, suggesting that ACE inhibitors may represent a novel  therapeutic strategy to treat corneal angiogenesis.","2010-04-23","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","720-728","","","16","","Mol Vis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 20431722  PMCID: PMC2861126","","","","Female; Animals; Rabbits; Cells, Cultured; Tissue Distribution; Tissue Culture Techniques; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Fibroblasts/metabolism; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1/*metabolism; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Enalapril/pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*metabolism; Cornea/*metabolism/pathology; Corneal Neovascularization/chemically induced/*metabolism/pathology; Epithelium, Corneal/metabolism; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The regulation of gene expression by Ang II occurs through  specific receptors that are linked to changes in the activity of transcription  factors within the nucleus of target cells. In particular, members of the nuclear  factor-kappaB family of transcription factors are activated, which in turn fuels  at least two autocrine reinforcing loops that amplify Ang II and tumor necrosis  factor-alpha formation. Angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors and  angiotensin antagonists (AIIAs) differ both pharmacokinetically and  pharmacodynamically in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Several ACE  inhibitors (such as captopril, enalapril and lisinopril) are dialyzable, whereas  all of the AIIAs studied are not.

It is at least as effective as  usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, metoprolol and  nifedipine while direct comparisons with other ACE inhibitors have not been  reported. Many patients achieve an adequate blood pressure reduction with  lisinopril alone, and in those who do not, most will with the addition of  hydrochlorothiazide; lisinopril also attenuates hypokalaemia induced by thiazide  diuretics. In patients with congestive heart failure resistant to conventional  therapy, lisinopril 2.5 to 20 mg once daily improved indices of cardiac function  and appeared to produce greater benefit than captopril in one controlled study.  Lisinopril is well tolerated, with few serious adverse effects being reported.  Thus, lisinopril is a suitable treatment for essential hypertension and shows  promise in the treatment of congestive heart failure. If additional studies  confirm these preliminary findings, then lisinopril will have a similar profile  of indications to other ACE inhibitors, and like some other drugs in this class  it offers the convenience of once daily administration.","1988-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","646-669","","6","35","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2844497","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Lisinopril; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many advantages, e.g. to improve the  compliance or pharmacodynamic response in comparison to a monotherapy or to  increase the therapy safety. Until now, there are only a few products available  for the paediatric population due to the lack of age appropriate dosage forms or  studies proving the efficacy and safety of these products. This study aims to  develop orodispersible films (ODFs) in a continuous solvent casting process as  child appropriate dosage form containing both enalapril maleate (EM) and  hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) separated in different film layers. Furthermore, they  should be characterised and the API migration analysed by confocal Raman  microscopy (CRM). ODFs were successfully produced in a continuous manufacturing  process in form of double- and triple-layer formulations based on  hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) or a combination of HPC and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).  CRM revealed that both APIs migrate within the film layers shortly after  manufacturing. PVA inhibits the migration inside the double-layer film, but is  not able to prevent the API migration as an interlayer inside a triple-layer ODF.  With increasing film layers, the content of residual solvents and the  disintegration time increases (mono-layer films: <10 s, triple-layer films:  37 s). In conclusion, it was feasible to produce fixed-dose combinations in  therapeutic doses up to 9 mg HCT and 3.5 mg EM for the double-layer film with  adequate mechanical properties, which enable coiling up onto jumbo rolls directly  after production. The best separation of the two APIs was achieved by casting a  double-layer ODF consisting of different film forming polymers, which can be  beneficial when processing two incompatible APIs.","2018-05-30","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","236-244","","","117","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recent reference-based pricing measures have targeted several drug  classes, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The objective  of this study was to assess whether patients treated for hypertension with  various ACE inhibitors differed in their utilization of health care services and  hence, whether the various ACE inhibitors should be considered therapeutically  equivalent. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was formed from 4709 Saskatchewan  residents aged 40-79 years who initiated treatment for hypertension with 1 of the  3 most frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril or lisinopril)  between Jan. 1, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1993. Information obtained from universal  insurance databases included prescription drug use, the number of visits to a  general practitioner (GP) or specialist and the number of hospital admissions  during the year before treatment was initiated and during a follow-up period of  up to 4 years. Rates were statistically adjusted for potential confounding  variables and compared across treatment groups. RESULTS: Of the 4709 patients,  529 were prescribed captopril initially, 2939 enalapril and 1241 lisinopril.  After treatment was initiated patients prescribed captopril were dispensed more  medications on average, with an overall rate of 18.6 prescriptions per patient  per year (v. 16.4 and 14.7 for enalapril and lisinopril users respectively); they  were admitted to hospital more often, and they made more visits to GPs and  specialists. The adjusted rate ratio of the number of visits to a GP for patients  receiving enalapril, relative to captopril, was 0.84 (95% confidence interval  [CI] 0.80-0.88), and for those receiving lisinopril it was 0.79 (95% CI  0.74-0.83). The adjusted rate ratios for the number of visits to a specialist  were similar but lower, and for the number of hospital admissions they were 0.82  for patients prescribed enalapril initially (95% CI 0.73-0.93) and 0.65 (95% CI  0.56-0.75) for those prescribed lisinopril. INTERPRETATION: Patients with  hypertension who are initially prescribed captopril used health care services  more than those initially prescribed enalapril or lisinopril. This suggests that  ACE inhibitors may not be therapeutically equivalent.","1999-08-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","255-260","","3","161","","CMAJ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 10463046  PMCID: PMC1230501","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Cohort Studies; Therapeutic Equivalency; Retrospective Studies; Hypertension/*drug therapy; *Economics, Pharmaceutical; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*economics/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Cost Control; Drug Prescriptions/*economics; Health Services/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plasma concentrations of the active moieties were analyzed  with a physiologically based model taking into account the binding to ACE (high  affinity, low capacity). An influence of renal insufficiency on enalapril  disposition was shown with an increase in its plasma concentration, which was  correlated to the reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. No such effect was  evidenced for benazepril. With the physiologically based model analysis, it was  shown that renal impairment led to an increase of the apparent benazeprilat  clearance (260%), whereas that of enalaprilat was reduced to 40 to 55%. Renal  insufficiency had no significant effect either on the apparent volume of  distribution of each drug or on the binding parameters [i.e., maximal binding  capacity (B(max)) and affinity (K(d))]. Enalaprilat and benazeprilat inhibitory  action on ACE also was evaluated ex vivo. Similar patterns of inhibition were  observed for both drugs. Renal injury had no significant influence on the overall  effect of benazeprilat, whereas the inhibition effect of enalaprilat was  significantly increased. It was concluded that renal insufficiency may have  effects on the ACEI disposition but that the measurable active moiety plasma  concentration is not the most appropriate endpoint to describe and interpret the  consequence of a renal injury on ACEI.","2000-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1094-1103","","3","292","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10688628","","","","Female; Animals; Models, Biological; Dogs; Regression Analysis; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics; Renal Insufficiency/*metabolism; Enalapril/*pharmacokinetics; Benzazepines/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The angiotensin type-1 blocking and  cardioprotective properties of perindopril and enalapril were studied in a rat  model of dilated cardiomyopathy after autoimmune myocarditis. Enalapril at 20  mg/kg showed the same angiotensin type-1 blocking action as perindopril at 2  mg/kg in rats with heart failure. Twenty-eight days after immunization, surviving  Lewis rats (90/120 = 75%) were divided into six groups and administered  perindopril at 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mg/kg per day (Groups P0.02, P0.2 and P2),  enalapril at 2 and 20 mg/kg per day (Groups E2 and E20) or vehicle alone (Group  V, all groups n = 15). After oral administration for 1 month, four of 15 (27%)  rats in Group V, and two (13%) in Groups P0.02 and E2 died. None of the animals  in Groups P0.2, P2 and E20, or normal rats (Group N) died. Although both  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improved ventricular function in a  dose-dependent manner, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and area of  myocardial fibrosis were lower, and +/- dP/dt was higher in Group P2 (4.9 +/- 0.6  mmHg, 7.5 +/- 1.4% and +2651 +/- 254/-2622 +/- 189 mmHg/s, respectively) than in  Group V (16.7 +/- 1.3, 36 +/- 2.6 and +2659 +/- 176/-2516 +/- 205, respectively)  and Group E20 (7.5 +/- 2.5, 15.6 +/- 2.0 and +2018 +/- 110/-2097 +/- 102,  respectively).

Traditionally,  dissolution media is not compatible with mass spectrometry since the inorganic  salts in the media might damage the mass spectrometer. Here, paper spray  ionization mass spectrometry (PSI-MS), one of the ambient mass spectrometry  technologies, is developed to characterize the content of drugs in dissolution  media. The porous structure of paper can effectively retain salts from entering  mass spectrometer. This makes the measurement of drug content within dissolution  media by mass spectrometer possible. After the experimental parameters were  optimized, calibration curves of model drugs - enalapril, quinapril and  benazepril were established by using corresponding deuterated internal standards.

More importantly, the analysis time of 6  samples is shortened from 90min to 6min. Detection limit of enalapril maleate  tablets by PSI-MS is 1/300 of LC.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether  interindividual variability in the response to ACE inhibitors is explained by the  ""ACE phenotype""-for example, variability in plasma ACE concentration, activity,  and conformation and/or the degree of ACE inhibition in each individual. METHODS:  The ACE phenotype was determined in plasma of 14 patients with hypertension  treated chronically for 4 weeks with 40 mg enalapril (E) or 20 mg E + 16 mg  candesartan (EC) and in 20 patients with hypertension treated acutely with a  single dose (20 mg) of E with or without pretreatment with hydrochlorothiazide.  The ACE phenotyping included (1) plasma ACE concentration; (2) ACE activity (with  2 substrates: Hip-His-Leu and Z-Phe-His-Leu and calculation of their ratio); (3)  detection of ACE inhibitors in patient's blood (indicator of patient compliance)  and the degree of ACE inhibition (ie, adherence); and (4) ACE conformation.  RESULTS: Enalapril reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in most  patients; however, 20% of patients were considered nonresponders. Chronic  treatment results in 40% increase in serum ACE concentrations, with the exception  of 1 patient. There was a trend toward better response to ACEI among patients who  had a higher plasma ACE concentration. CONCLUSION: Due to the fact that ""20% of  patients do not respond to ACEI by blood pressure drop,"" the initial blood ACE  level could not be a predictor of blood pressure reduction in an individual  patient. However, ACE phenotyping provides important information about  conformational and kinetic changes in ACE of individual patients, and this could  be a reason for resistance to ACE inhibitors in some nonresponders.","2017-07","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","374-386","","4","22","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28587581","","","","Humans; Phenotype; Double-Blind Method; Predictive Value of Tests; Cross-Over Studies; Treatment Outcome; Drug Monitoring; Genotype; Pharmacogenetics; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; *Pharmacogenomic Variants; Patient Selection; Drug Therapy, Combination; *Precision Medicine; Pharmacogenomic Testing; blood pressure; hypertension; Biphenyl Compounds; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; ACE inhibitor; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; angiotensin-converting enzyme; Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use; Tetrazoles/therapeutic use; Hydrochlorothiazide/therapeutic use; Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/therapeutic use; ACE conformation; ACE phenotyping; Drug Resistance/genetics; Enalapril/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/physiopathology; nonresponders; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*genetics/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hepatic intrinsic clearances for enalapril (26.1  ml/min) and enalaprilat (0.7 ml/min), found in a previous study, were used for  simulation because, along with their given diffusional clearances (75 and 2  ml/min, respectively), they yielded a high extraction ratio for drug (E = 0.86)  and a poor extraction ratio for the preformed metabolite (E = 0.05).

A.","Comparison of beta-blockade and ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension.","Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology","","0160-2446","","","There are important pharmacodynamic differences between the various beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)  inhibitors differ mainly in their pharmacokinetic properties. The differing  properties of the beta-blocking drugs may contribute to their antihypertensive  effect; possibly, the beta1-selective agents are slightly more effective.  Comparisons between groups of drugs may not be fully applicable to all members of  the group. Overall, however, beta-blocking drugs and ACE inhibitors appear to  control the resting blood pressure to a similar degree, whereas on exercise the  rise in blood pressure is inhibited to a greater extent by beta1-blockade. ACE  inhibitors reverse the hemodynamic changes of hypertension in contrast to  beta1-blocking drugs without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Neither  group of drugs interferes with cardiovascular reflexes such as the response to  posture. The beta-blocking drugs have specific contraindications such as asthma  and heart failure. Although some earlier studies suggested otherwise, more recent  smaller investigations suggest that overall patient acceptability of ACE  inhibitors and beta-blockers is similar. In certain instances, particularly in  the presence of diuretics, a large first-dose effect with a profound fall in  blood pressure may be seen with ACE inhibitors. In contrast to other drugs, there  is some evidence that beta-blocking drugs have a cardioprotective effect. ACE  inhibitors and beta-blocking drugs have a similar spectrum of activity, with  black patients responding less well. Although in dispute, drugs are often useful  in the elderly. Both groups possess additional therapeutic indications that may  influence the choice to treat hypertension.","1990","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","S81-85","","","16 Suppl 5","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11527141","","","","Humans; Animals; Heart Rate/drug effects/physiology; Exercise/physiology; Blood Pressure/drug effects/physiology; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Enalapril/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Bisoprolol/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is  involved in a wide range of adverse effects that contribute to the pathogenesis  of CHD in diabetic patients, including vascular haemodynamic regulation,  oxidative stress and hypertrophy of vascular cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in  clinical practice. In diabetic patients ACE inhibitors and ARBs both effectively  lower blood pressure, particularly in combination with low-dose thiazide  diuretics, and may be considered first line therapies in the treatment of  diabetic hypertension. Additionally they have important renoprotective actions  independent of their blood pressure-lowering action, which is of particular  benefit in diabetic patients, who are at increased risk of developing  nephropathy. ARBs are generally well tolerated, but ACE inhibitor therapy is  associated with some side effects such as cough and both may result in  hyperkalaemia. Blockade of the RAAS with these agents appears to play an  important role not only in protecting from renal disease, but it may also help to  reduce morbidity and mortality from certain vascular diseases in diabetic  patients.","2008-02","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","63-78","","1","4","","Curr Diabetes Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 18220697","","","","Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications; Diabetic Angiopathies/*prevention & control; Coronary Disease/prevention & control; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects/*physiology; Enalapril/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using rat liver S9 as an enzyme  source and enalapril as a CES1 substrate, the present study examined effects of a  number of flavonoids on the formation of enalaprilat (the active form of  enalapril) produced by CES1-mediated hydrolysis. While a majority of flavonoids  tested showed inhibition on CES1, an unexpected hormetic effect was observed for  epigallocatechin (EGC) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), i.e., stimulatory  effect at low concentrations and enzyme inhibition at high concentrations.  Further experiments revealed that oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide,  arachidonic acid plus iron, and oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLOL) reduced  CES1 activity in rat liver S9 and the loss of CES1 enzyme activity could be  rescued largely by EGC or EGCG. In contrast, such effects were minimal in human  liver S9, probably due to the presence of a higher ratio of reduced vs oxidized  forms of glutathione. The above findings suggest that the polyphenolic nature of  EGC or EGCG might be responsible for rescuing CES1 activity under oxidative  stress. Because of the importance of CES1 in drug activation or deactivation and  rat liver S9 as a versatile in vitro system used for drug metabolism studies and  drug safety assessment, caution should be exercised to avoid potential biases for  data interpretation and decision making when CES1 activity in rat liver S9 is  evaluated with dependency on experimental conditions.","2023-09-01","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","110612","","","382","","Chem Biol Interact","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate their  cell-permeability and anti-cytokine activity in the cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The uptake of javamide-I/-II and esters was studied in THP-1 cells and PBMCs.  Also, kinetic and inhibition studies were conducted using THP-1 cells. Western  Blot was performed to determine the level of ATF-2 phosphorylation in THP-1  cells, and ELISA assays were carried out to measure TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-1beta  and IL-8 levels in PBMCs. KEY FINDINGS: In THP-1 cells, the uptake of  javamide-I/-II esters was significantly higher than javamide-I/-II (P < 0.001),  and the K(m) for javamide-I ester was 27 μM. Also, the uptake of the esters was  inhibited by PepT2 substrate/blocker. In THP-1 cells, javamide-I/-II esters were  also biotransformed into javamide-I/-II. Furthermore, javamide-I ester could  inhibit ATF-2 phosphorylation better than javamide-I in the cells, suggesting  that the ester could be transported inside the cells better than javamide-I.  Similarly, javamide-I/-II esters were found to be transported and biotransformed  in PBMCs involved in inflammation processes. As anticipated, the esters were  found to inhibit TNF-alpha and MCP-1 significantly in PBMCs (P < 0.005).

Twelve pony stallions were evaluated by physical examination and  echocardiography followed by treatment with enalapril (n=6) or placebo (n=6) for  2 months. After one month, blood was drawn and stored to evaluate ACE activity in  the 2 groups. At the end of the study, repeat physical examination and  echocardiography were performed. Physical examination, echocardiographic indices,  and reproductive performance were unchanged and there was no suppression of ACE  activity.

METHODS: Eligible participants of  the CSPPT were randomly assigned to a double-blind daily treatment of a combined  enalapril 10-mg and folic acid 0.8-mg tablet or an enalapril 10-mg tablet alone.  In total, 8384 male participants of the CSPPT were included in the current  analyses. The primary outcome was first stroke. RESULTS: The median treatment  duration was 4.5 years. In the enalapril-alone group, the first stroke risk  varied by baseline folate levels and smoking status (never versus ever).  Specifically, there was an inverse association between folate levels and first  stroke in never smokers (P for linear trend=0.043). However, no such association  was found in ever smokers. A test for interaction between baseline folate levels  and smoking status on first stroke was significant (P=0.045). In the total  sample, folic acid therapy significantly reduced the risk of first stroke in  never smokers with folate deficiency (hazard risk, 0.36; 95% confidence interval,  0.16-0.83) and in ever smokers with normal folate levels (hazard risk, 0.69; 95%  confidence interval, 0.48-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline folate levels and smoking  status can interactively affect the risk of first stroke. Our data suggest that  compared with never smokers, ever smokers may require a higher dosage of folic  acid to achieve a greater beneficial effect on stroke. Our findings need to be  confirmed by future randomized trials. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:  https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Recently, several new ACE inhibitors  with pharmacokinetic features different from earlier agents such as captopril or  enalapril have come into use. This review discusses the use of pharmacokinetics  to optimise ACE inhibitory therapy in various patient groups. Among the  pharmacokinetic characteristics of ACE inhibitors the route of excretion and to a  lesser degree the half-life appear to be the most clinically relevant. There is  no evidence that being a prodrug offers a significant clinical advantage. The  importance of varying tissue penetration also remains to be determined. Knowledge  of ACE inhibitor pharmacokinetics is particularly important in patients with  renal or hepatic dysfunction in whom the major route of excretion of these agents  is impaired. This might also be the case in elderly patients or those with severe  congestive heart failure. However, for most ACE inhibitors, major changes in the  drug dosage (amount or interval) are necessary only when the glomerular  filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min (1.80 L/h). The occurrence of adverse  effects due to overdosage or drug interactions may be prevented by adapting the  prescription of an ACE inhibitor to its pharmacokinetic characteristics.","1992-05","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","375-384","","5","22","","Clin Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 1505143","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Biological Availability; Tissue Distribution; Aging/metabolism; Hypertension/*drug therapy/metabolism; Kidney Diseases/metabolism; Liver Diseases/metabolism; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Pregnancy/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concentration-effect relationships were characterized  in 13 subjects following a single dose of enalapril (20 mg) and for each  individual the derived parameters were used to predict the steady-state blood  pressure profile. The predicted responses (before dosing and 4 h after dosing)  were in close agreement with the responses observed after 6 weeks. In individual  patients, the observed and predicted blood pressure profiles over a 12 h period  were compared. In six of the 13 subjects, there were statistically significant (P  less than 0.05) prediction errors. However, in all but one of these patients the  error was less than 10%, and for the group as a whole the mean prediction error  was small and not statistically significant (-0.6 +/- 2.1 mmHg). The  kinetic-dynamic parameters derived from observations of the first dose were used  to simulate steady-state responses to several alternative doses and dose  frequencies. A regimen of 10 mg twice daily increased the ratio of blood pressure  at trough-to-peak response to 75 +/- 5% compared to 33 +/- 16% when 20 mg was  given once daily. In addition, a twice-daily regimen reduced the coefficient of  variation of the hourly average blood pressure. Thus, concentration-effect  parameters derived from the first dose response to enalapril have potential not  only for predicting long-term antihypertensive response, but also for optimizing  dosage regimens for individual patients.","1990-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1085-1090","","12","8","","J Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 1962796","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Time Factors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Models, Theoretical; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Enalapril/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though the conclusions  drawn from published data are quite inconsistent, in most review articles PEPT1  is claimed to mediate the intestinal absorption of ACE inhibitors and thus to  determine their oral availability. We systematically investigated the interaction  of a series of ACE inhibitors with PEPT1 and PEPT2. First, we studied the effect  of 14 ACE inhibitors including new drugs on the uptake of the dipeptide  [14C]glycylsarcosine into human intestinal Caco-2 cells constitutively expressing  PEPT1 and rat renal SKPT cells expressing PEPT2. In a second approach, the  interaction of ACE inhibitors with heterologously expressed human PEPT1 and PEPT2  was determined. In both assay systems, zofenopril and fosinopril were found to  have very high affinity for binding to peptide transporters. Medium to low  affinity for transporter interaction was found for benazepril, quinapril,  trandolapril, spirapril, cilazapril, ramipril, moexipril, quinaprilat, and  perindopril. For enalapril, lisinopril, and captopril, very weak affinity or lack  of interaction was found. Transport currents of PEPT1 and PEPT2 expressed in  Xenopus laevis oocytes were recorded by the two-electrode voltage-clamp  technique. Statistically significant, but very low currents were only observed  for lisinopril, enalapril, quinapril, and benazepril at PEPT1 and for spirapril  at PEPT2. For the other ACE inhibitors, electrogenic transport activity was  extremely low or not measurable at all. The present results suggest that peptide  transporters do not control intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of ACE  inhibitors.","2008-11","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","432-441","","2","327","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18713951","","","","Humans; Female; Animals; Rats; Intestinal Absorption; Biological Transport; Xenopus laevis; Kidney/metabolism; Caco-2 Cells; Peptide Transporter 1; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology; Dipeptides/metabolism; Symporters/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With  particular respect to the choice of ACE inhibitor drug, there are no definitive  direct comparisons in the treatment of renal disease. In terms of blood pressure  reduction, however, there is evidence that spirapril is at least as effective as  the reference ACE inhibitor, enalapril. However, patients with diabetic  nephropathy and/or chronic renal failure are at potential risk from drug  accumulation if the preferred agent relies predominantly on glomerular filtration  for its elimination. In this respect spirapril may have an advantage because it  has been shown that there are no clinically relevant increases in the  spirapril(at) concentrations (24 h post-dose) even in the setting of advanced  renal failure (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min). Thus, there is no requirement to  modify the dose and no concerns about drug accumulation or the potential for  exaggerated therapeutic or adverse effects. In summary, an ACE inhibitor drug is  seen as an integral component of the drug treatment regimen for patients with  nephropathy. Where there is renal failure it may be prudent to administer a drug,  such as spirapril, which also has alternative elimination mechanisms.","1999-08","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","S31-34","","","34 Suppl 1","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10499562","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Diabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy; Enalapril/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The antihypertensive efficacy of  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been questioned in this age group,  in which low-renin hypertension is common. The latter condition might be thought  to favor blood pressure control with diuretics and impair the response to  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, recent studies with  lisinopril, a new long-acting, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitor, indicate that reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in  older hypertensive patients receiving either angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitor or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy were not significantly different.

The  TTS of EM was prepared by solvent evaporation technique using polymers Eudragit  E100 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone K-30 in varying ratios, 5% w/w dibutylphthalate as  plasticizer and 10% w/w PH as penetration enhancer. The TTS was evaluated for  in-vitro drug release using paddle over disc method and ex-vivo skin permeation  using modified Keshary and Chein diffusion cell. The interaction studies were  carried out by comparing the results of assay, UV and TLC analysis for pure drug  and medicated and TTS formulation. Skin irritation potential of TTS was assessed  by visual examination of treated rat skin. Stability studies were conducted  according to ICH guidelines at a temperature of 40+/-0.5 degrees C and 75+/-5%  RH. The optimized formulation was evaluated for preclinical bioavailability and  antihypertensive efficacy using albino rat model. The optimized formulation  provided 87.3% drug release in-vitro and a flux of 380 microg/cm(2)/hr over a  period of 48 hours. No chemical interaction was found between the drug and  excipients and there were no signs of skin irritation on application of patch.  The optimized formulation was stable with a tentative shelf life of two years.  Significant fall in BP (p<0.001) was observed in experimental hypertensive rats  which was maintained for 2 days. There was 3 fold improvement in bioavailability  with TTS vis-à-vis marketed tablet (AUC(0 to t) : 1253.9 ng.h/ml vs. 422.88  ng.h/ml).

Studies were performed on rats given the loop diuretic torasemide acutely (20  min) or chronically (12 days), either alone or in combination with the  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril. In the sodium-absorbing  cells of the distal tubule and cortical collecting duct-that is, in distal  convoluted tubule (DCT), connecting tubule (CNT) and principal cells-an acute  increase in sodium delivery caused a significant rise in intracellular sodium  concentration and rubidium uptake, the latter an index of in vivo Na,K(Rb)-ATPase  activity. The elevated cell sodium concentrations returned to, or close to,  control values during chronic torasemide treatment. Intracellular rubidium  concentrations, measured after a 30-second rubidium exposure, were not different  from controls in DCT and CNT cells but were still higher in principal cells.  Since, however, the distribution space for rubidium was significantly increased  in chronic torasemide animals, rubidium uptake, and hence Na,K-ATPase activity,  must have increased in proportion to cell volume in DCT and CNT cells, but more  than proportionately in principal cells. When ACE was inhibited during chronic  torasemide, the epithelial volume of DCT and cortical collecting duct (CCD) was  increased mainly by lengthening and not, as was the case in rats given torasemide  alone, by thickening of the tubule wall. Adaptation of the proximal tubule  exclusively by lengthening was not affected by inhibition of the ACE. These data  indicate that changes in cell ion composition may participate in initiating cell  processes leading to adaptation of distal nephron segments to chronically  increased salt delivery. Inhibition of the ACE reverses the torasemide-induced  increase in apparent Na pump density in principal cells and seems to shift the  relationship between hypertrophy and hyperplasia noted in DCT and CCD after  chronic torasemide in favor of hyperplasia.","1997-01","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","36-43","","1","51","","Kidney Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8995715","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Body Weight; Rats, Wistar; Hematocrit; Urine; Kidney Function Tests; Anesthesia; Consciousness; Rubidium/pharmacokinetics; Sulfonamides/*pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Enalapril/*pharmacology; Diuresis/drug effects; Water-Electrolyte Balance; Electrolytes/blood/urine; Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism; Torsemide; Diuretics/*pharmacology; Aldosterone/physiology; Angiotensin II/physiology; Kidney Cortex/drug effects/enzymology; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/enzymology; Sodium/metabolism/pharmacology; Vasoconstrictor Agents/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent  studies have shown a positive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on RRF in PD patients.  OBJECTIVE: To compare enalapril and losartan for RRF preservation in automated  peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An open label  randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12 month follow-up period was conducted  to compare the effect of enalapril vs. losartan on RRF preservation in 60 APD  patients. Measurements were done at the start of the study (baseline), 3, 6, 9,  and 12 months. A historical control group (HCG) without treatment was included to  assess the natural history of RRF loss. RESULTS: RRF in the enalapril group  dropped from 3.65 +/- 1.6 (baseline) to 2.36 +/- 0.38 mL/min/1.73 m2 (12 months).  In the losartan group RRF was reduced from 4.1+/- 2.01 (baseline) to 2.54 +/-  0.47 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 (12 months). There were not significant differences between  the two groups regarding RRF at 12 months. In the HCG, RRF declined from 3.68 +/-  0.48 to 1.4 +/- 0.29 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 (12 months). RRF in the HCG was  significantly lower than RRF in the two treated groups at 12 months (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: There was not significant difference on RRF preservation between  enalapril and losartan groups. Comparing these results to those of the HCG  suggests that the treatment with any of the drugs is useful in preserving RRF.","2012-08","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","315-321","","4","64","","Rev Invest Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Mexico PMID: 23227581","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Disease Progression; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Blood Glucose/analysis; Blood Urea Nitrogen; Creatinine/blood/urine; Kidney/*drug effects/physiopathology; Metabolic Clearance Rate/*drug effects; Urea/blood/urine; *Peritoneal Dialysis/methods; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Enalapril/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Kidney Failure, Chronic/drug therapy/*physiopathology/therapy; Losartan/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers on blood pressure was  determined with adult dTG rats treated with enalapril from 3 to 12 weeks of age.  Tissue expression levels of renin and angiotensinogen were determined in dTG rats  and rhesus monkeys by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Upon withdrawal from enalapril,  mean arterial pressure (MAP) rose to 160-180 mmHg, with 95% of the female dTG  rats surviving for 6 to 12 months, In Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and rhesus  monkeys, renin mRNA was absent or weakly expressed in most tissues, except for  the kidneys and adrenals. In dTG rats, human renin expression was high in many  additional tissues. The expression of human angiotensinogen in dTG rats followed  a similar tissue pattern to SD and rhesus monkey angiotensinogen.

Because sufficient data on intravenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  following coronary artery bypass surgery complicated by postoperative left  ventricular dysfunction are unavailable, the efficacy and safety of intravenously  administered enalaprilat were evaluated. DESIGN: A placebo-controlled,  randomized, double-blind protocol. SETTING: Postoperative intensive care unit at  the German Heart Institute Berlin. PATIENTS: Forty patients with a left  ventricular ejection fraction <35% following coronary artery bypass surgery on  the second postoperative day or after weaning from intra-aortic balloon  counterpulsation. INTERVENTIONS: A loading dose of enalaprilat 0.625 mg infused  over 1 hr was followed by 5 mg/24 hrs administered continuously for up to 72 hrs.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic variables,  blood gases, hormonal variables, renal function, and electrolytes were measured  before and repeatedly during therapy. Acute effects were as follows: At 1 hr,  enalaprilat increased the cardiac index (p <.001), stroke volume index (p <.001),  and right ventricular stroke work index (p <.03) compared with placebo, whereas  mean arterial pressure (p <.008) and both systemic (p <.001) and pulmonary (p  <.02) vascular resistance decreased. Continuous effects were as follows: Over 72  hrs, enalaprilat decreased diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (p <.019),  pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (p <.02), and central venous pressure (p  <.02). The cardiac and stroke volume indexes were consistently higher in the  enalaprilat group, whereas systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were  lower. The arterial blood-pressure lowering effect was blunted and heart rate  remained unchanged. Mixed venous oxygenation (p <.02) was higher and arterial  oxygenation was not modified. Finally, enalaprilat increased creatinine clearance  (p <.002) and decreased creatinine (p <.02) and urea (p <.03).

Studies of several  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have demonstrated marked  differences on platelets. Therefore this prospective, randomized, double-blind,  crossover study compared the ex vivo effects of equivalent antihypertensive doses  of captopril, enalapril, and fosinopril on platelet aggregation and thromboxane  B2 (TxB2) formation in subjects with stage I-II essential hypertension. Nineteen  male subjects with a baseline mean seated blood pressure of 141 +/- 3/100 +/- 1  mm Hg were enrolled. The decline in mean arterial pressure after 4 weeks of  stable dosing was 10 +/- 1, 12 +/- 1, and 11 +/- 1 mm Hg for captopril,  enalapril, and fosinopril, respectively (p = NS). There was no significant change  in adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, epinephrine-, or thrombin-stimulated platelet  aggregation from baseline or between ACE inhibitors. Compared with baseline,  fosinopril decreased TxB2 concentrations 27.5-67.6% with all stimuli after 1 and  5 min. Captopril also decreased TxB2 formation, but this effect was stimulus and  time dependent. Enalapril consistently increased TxB2 concentrations, independent  of stimuli or time. We conclude that different ACE inhibitors have distinct  effects on platelet TxB2 formation without significant effects on platelet  aggregation. Fosinopril may be a direct antagonist ofTxA2 synthase, suggesting  benefit in syndromes of platelet activation or vascular occlusion.","1997-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","461-467","","4","30","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9335405","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Area Under Curve; Hypertension/*blood/drug therapy; Platelet Aggregation/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Blood Platelets/*drug effects/physiology; Thromboxane B2/antagonists & inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors improve glomerular size-selectivity, whether this effect is  solely due to ANG II blocking or if other mediators also play a contributory role  is not clear yet. We studied 20 proteinuric patients with IgA nephropathy, who  received either enalapril (20 mg/day) or the ANG II receptor blocker irbesartan  (100 mg/day) for 28 days in a randomized double-blind study. Measurements of  blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and fractional clearance of neutral dextran  of graded sizes were performed before and after 28 days of treatment. Both  enalapril and irbesartan significantly reduced blood pressure over baseline. This  reduction reached the maximum effect 4-6 h after drug administration but did not  last for the entire 24-h period. Despite transient antihypertensive effect,  proteinuria was effectively reduced by both treatments to comparable extents.  Neither enalapril nor irbesartan modified the sieving coefficients of small  dextran molecules, but both effectively reduced transglomerular passage of large  test macromolecules. Theoretical analysis of sieving coefficients showed that  neither drug affected significantly the mean pore radius or the spread of the  pore-size distribution, but both importantly and comparably reduced the  importance of a nonselective shunt pathway. These data suggest that antagonism of  ANG II is the key mechanism by which ACE inhibitors exert their beneficial effect  on glomerular size-selective function and consequently on glomerular filtration  and urinary output of plasma proteins.","1999-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","F457-466","","3","276","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10070170","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Single-Blind Method; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Molecular Weight; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Tetrazoles/*therapeutic use; Kidney/drug effects/physiopathology; *Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Irbesartan; Kidney Glomerulus/*metabolism; Dextrans/chemistry/pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/*therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds/*therapeutic use; Glomerulonephritis, IGA/*drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dogs are commonly used in preclinical evaluation  of regional intestinal absorption and in the development of novel MR dosage  forms. This study determined regional intestinal effective permeability (Peff) in  dogs with the aim to improve regional Peff prediction in humans. Four model  drugs, atenolol, enalaprilat, metoprolol, and ketoprofen, were intravenously and  regionally dosed twice as a solution into the proximal small intestine (P-SI) and  large intestine (LI) of three dogs with intestinal stomas. Based on plasma data  from two separate study occasions for each dog, regional Peff values were  calculated using a validated intestinal deconvolution method. The determined mean  Peff values were 0.62, 0.14, 1.06, and 3.66 × 10(-4) cm/s in the P-SI, and 0.13,  0.02, 1.03, and 2.20 × 10(-4) cm/s in the LI, for atenolol, enalaprilat,  metoprolol, and ketoprofen, respectively. The determined P-SI Peff values in dog  were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.98) to the historically directly determined  human jejunal Peff after a single-pass perfusion. The determined dog P-SI Peff  values were also successfully implemented in GI-Sim to predict the risk for  overestimation of LI absorption of low permeability drugs. We conclude that the  dog intestinal stoma model is a useful preclinical tool for determination of  regional intestinal permeability. Still, further studies are recommended to  evaluate additional APIs, sources of variability, and formulation types, for more  accurate determination of the dog model in the drug development process.","2016-09-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","3022-3033","","9","13","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27500599","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; pharmacokinetics; Intestinal Absorption; Dogs; Permeability; Metoprolol/pharmacokinetics; bioavailability; Intestine, Small/*metabolism; Atenolol/pharmacokinetics; Ketoprofen/pharmacokinetics; Jejunum/metabolism; Enalaprilat/pharmacokinetics; Intestine, Large/*metabolism; dog intestinal permeability; effective permeability; intestinal perfusion; pharmaceutical development; regional intestinal drug absorption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In literature,  ODTMs based on a commercialized co-processed excipient based on mannitol  (Ludiflash®) have been already described. Isomalt is known for its pleasant  sensory properties and therefore appears to be a good candidate for ODMTs. The  feasibility of the direct compression grade of isomalt for the manufacture of  ODMTs was assessed and compared to Ludiflash®. Hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril  maleate were chosen as model drugs and compressed to 2 mm mini-tablets. ODMTs  could be obtained fulfilling the criteria of Ph.Eur. with disintegration times of  180 s or even the FDA limit of 30 s. Dissolution studies and mass variation were  fulfilled for all mini-tablets. Acceptance values (AV) ≤ 15 were achieved for  formulations based on both isomalt and Ludiflash®. Stability data showed the  change of disintegration time and tensile strength as a function of storing time,  condition and excipient.

Previous  experiments in our laboratory have shown that candesartan 1 mg/kg administered  after reperfusion in a model of hypertension after experimental ischemic stroke  reduces neurovascular damage and improves outcome. These results could be either  mediated by BP lowering or a BP-independent cerebrovascular protective effect.  OBJECTIVES: To determine the contribution of BP lowering to the neurovascular  protection previously reported with candesartan after stroke. METHODS: Male  Wistar rats (280-305 g) underwent 3 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).  At reperfusion, either hydralazine 1 mg/kg (n = 8), enalapril 5 mg/kg (n = 7) or  enalapril 10 mg/kg (n = 8) were administered intravenously. BP was measured by  telemetry for 2 days before and 24 h after MCAO. After neurological function was  assessed, brain tissue was processed for infarct size and hemoglobin content  analyses. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 92 to 124 mmHg  immediately upon MCAO and decreased to 112 mmHg after reperfusion, remaining  elevated for 24 h (P < 0.0001) in the saline group. Hydralazine reduced MAP (P =  0.048) and infarct size (53 versus 30%, P = 0.0083), and there was a trend  towards decreased hemoglobin content. Enalapril 5 mg/kg did not significantly  change MAP or other outcomes. Enalapril 10 mg/kg reduced MAP (P < 0.0001) and  infarct size (53 versus 29%, P = 0.003). There was an intermediate effect on both  hemoglobin content and neurological function, neither one was significant. The  time course of BP lowering varied with each treatment. CONCLUSION: Acute BP  lowering after reperfusion in acute ischemic stroke is an effective strategy to  achieve neurovascular protection. The rate, extent and mechanism of BP lowering  may determine the magnitude of protection.","2007-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","855-859","","4","25","","J Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 17351379","","","","Male; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Rats; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Area Under Curve; Disease Models, Animal; Rats, Wistar; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Biomarkers/blood; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacology; Biphenyl Compounds; Reperfusion; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/pharmacology; Tetrazoles/pharmacology; Hydralazine/pharmacology; Benzimidazoles/pharmacology; Circadian Rhythm/drug effects; Telemetry; Brain Ischemia/etiology/*physiopathology/*prevention & control; Cerebrovascular Circulation/drug effects; Enalapril/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Hemoglobins/drug effects; Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery/complications/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The group treated with  reference drug has shown a significant reduction on blood pressure levels when  compared to the control group. Thus, treatments with enalapril maleate of  generic, similar-A and similar-B brands have also shown significant reduction on  animals' blood pressure.

SCH 33844 (0.03-1 mg/kg p.o.) produced dose-related inhibition of  angiotensin I (AI) pressor responses in conscious rats with a duration of 24 h at  the higher dose. SCH 33844 (0.3-30 mg/kg p.o.) reduced blood pressure in a  dose-related manner in conscious SHR with a 24-h duration. Antihypertensive  activity was enhanced in the presence of hydrochlorothiazide. The drug (1-10  mg/kg p.o.) also lowered blood pressure in conscious hydrochlorothiazide-treated  normotensive dogs. In anesthetized dogs, SCH 33844 (1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced blood  pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance and slightly increased cardiac  output and stroke volume. These results suggest that peripheral vasodilation is  the primary mechanism of the antihypertensive action. The metabolic profile of  SCH 33844 was evaluated in dogs and rats. The compound was absorbed in a  dose-proportional manner and excreted primarily as the diacid form. In contrast  to captopril and enalapril, most of the drug (67%) was excreted into the feces  following i.v. dosing. Chronic toxicological evaluation in dogs and rats  demonstrated that the drug was relatively devoid of toxicity at oral doses as  high as 400 and 450 mg/kg/day, respectively. Slight decreases in heart weight  (rats) and increases in granularity of the juxtaglomerular apparatus were  observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1987","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","S105-108","","","10 Suppl 7","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2485040","","","","Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Mice; Dogs; Tissue Distribution; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data were analyzed using a  variable-transit-time, space-distributed model with modifications accounting for  glomerular filtration and the observed 14% protein binding of enalaprilat; the  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from L-glucose clearance was 9.0 +/-  2.9% of total plasma flow. The ratio of renal clearance of unbound enalaprilat to  GFR was 1.56 +/- 0.29, indicating both glomerular filtration and net tubular  secretion of enalaprilat. Unidirectional influx from plasma to tubular cells  exceeded tubular secretion by a factor of 2.2 +/- 0.5. Thus only about one-half  of the enalaprilat taken up by the tubular cells was excreted into urine, with  the remainder refluxing into the capillary blood stream, indicating bidirectional  permeation of enalaprilat across the basolateral tubular membrane.","1992-11","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","F858-869","","5 Pt 2","263","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1332505","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Models, Biological; Algorithms; Indicator Dilution Techniques; Kidney/cytology/*metabolism; Diuresis; Extracellular Space/metabolism; Enalaprilat/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have studied the hemodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and neurohumoral  responses to the first dose of oral captopril 6.25 mg, enalapril 2.5 mg,  perindopril 2.0 mg, intravenous enalaprilat 1.5 mg, and perindoprilat 1.0 mg,  compared with oral or intravenous placebo in 6 parallel groups of 12 elderly  patients each with moderate-to-severe (New York Heart Association classes II-IV)  heart failure. Oral dosing with active drugs led to different temporal responses.  After captopril, there was an early short-lived decrease in BP. Enalapril led to  a later long-lasting decrease, but perindopril was not different from placebo.  Intravenous enalaprilat and intravenous perindoprilat each lowered BP to a  similar extent. The doses of drugs used appeared to be comparable because plasma  ACE inhibition was similar following perindopril or enalapril and also comparing  perindoprilat and enalaprilat. These studies indicate that oral ACE inhibitors  have different profiles of acute BP changes after the first dose. The explanation  is not clear, but could include physicochemical differences in the interaction  between prodrug ester and diacid metabolites leading to differences in tissue  distribution and local enzyme inhibition.","1993-06-24","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","57E-60E","","17","71","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8392282","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Enalapril/therapeutic use; Indoles/therapeutic use; Prodrugs/therapeutic use; Perindopril; Captopril/therapeutic use; Enalaprilat/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dispos. 12, 309-313 (1984)].  The present re-examination of data provided an explanation for these discrepant  observations: enalaprilat, being a polar dicarboxylic acid, encounters more of a  diffusional barrier than its precursor, enalapril, an ethyl ester of enalaprilat.  Programs written in Fortran 77 on mass balance relationships were employed to  simulate data upon varying the diffusional clearances for drug (CLd) and  metabolite [CLd(mi)] from 1 to 5000 ml/min. The metabolic and biliary intrinsic  clearances for drug and metabolite were found by trial and error such that the  combinations of all clearance parameters yielded data similar to enalaprilat, and  3H-enalaprilat. Our finding indicated that the diffusional clearance for  enalaprilat was low (2 ml/min) compared to that of enalapril (75 ml/min). The  presence of a diffusional barrier for enalaprilat retards entry of the preformed  metabolite into hepatocytes but prevents efflux of the intracellularly formed  generated metabolite into sinusoidal blood, thereby enhancing generated  metabolite elimination.","1986-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","513-520","","5","14","","Drug Metab Dispos","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2876855","","","","Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Perfusion; Models, Biological; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Computer Simulation; Liver/*metabolism; Bile/*metabolism; Diffusion; Enalaprilat; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unique and effective therapy for hypertension and congestive heart failure.","Postgraduate medicine","","0032-5481","10.1080/00325481.1985.11699167","","Major developments in the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure have occurred  since the discovery of captopril in June 1975. Early in the past decade, this  oral ACE inhibitor was restricted to refractory and severe cases of hypertension.  By July 1985, the Food and Drug Administration approved its use not only for all  degrees of hypertension but also for the initial treatment of hypertensive  patients with uncomplicated disease. New information has confirmed the  effectiveness of twice-daily administration (which favorably influences  compliance) and the lack of a need to monitor blood or urine levels to assure  safety. The renin-mediated and non-renin-mediated mechanisms of action of  captopril-induced ACE inhibition have been fully delineated, as has its side  effect profile, which does not include various CNS, sympathetic reflex, and  metabolic side effects seen with other antihypertensive agents. As the first  vasodilator to prove its efficacy in the acute and chronic treatment of  congestive heart failure to the FDA, captopril is now widely used throughout the  United States. ACE inhibition reduces symptoms, enhances exercise capacity, and  favorably affects sodium, water, and potassium homeostasis in patients with heart  failure. Also, recent but as yet unconfirmed evidence suggests that ACE  inhibition may prolong survival in these patients. The success of captopril, the  first oral agent of this class, promises to hold true for other ACE inhibitors  (such as enalapril), which have similar activities but differing pharmacokinetic  properties and will soon be available for clinical use. Further information on  these newer agents is anxiously awaited. In the near future, the clinician will  undoubtedly be able to choose from a large selection of ACE inhibitors for the  treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Therefore, it is important to learn  about any meaningful differences among ACE inhibitors and to contrast this class  of agents with older, standard therapies. This learning process is crucial as we  assess whether newer agents offer clinical advantages over the old.","1985-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","229-41, 244, 247-248","","5","78","","Postgrad Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 2864682","","","","Humans; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use; Erythema/chemically induced; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Neutropenia/chemically induced; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects; Captopril/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Enalapril/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Hypotension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Taste/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is no limit to the number of substitutions per prescription.  Doctors have expressed concern that patients may receive a different product each  time their prescription repeats are dispensed, which has the potential to confuse  patients. It is unknown how often multiple substitutions per prescription occur.  OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the number of switches per prescription for a  range of medicines and to determine the number of different brand and generic  products supplied on each prescription. METHODS: Repatriation Pharmaceutical  Benefits Scheme prescription claims between 1 January 2001 and 28 February 2006  were identified for atenolol, citalopram, enalapril, metformin, omeprazole,  ramipril, and simvastatin. Original prescriptions with five repeats and all  supplies dispensed were included. Switches were identified if a different product  was supplied on consecutive repeat dispensings. RESULTS: 533,279 original  prescriptions were included. 488,735 (92%) had no switches on repeats and 37,513  (7%) had only one switch. Only 1% of all prescriptions had more than one switch  identified on repeats, and in most cases only two different products were  supplied. None of the prescriptions had a different product supplied on each  dispensing. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Multiple switches per prescription are  uncommon and multiple different products are rarely supplied on repeats of the  same prescription. The rules of the brand substitution policy appear to be  adequate in allowing brand choice for patients, without leading to multiple  switches per prescription.","2007-08","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","348-352","","4","31","","Aust N Z J Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17725015","","","","Humans; Therapeutic Equivalency; Insurance Claim Review; Drugs, Generic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; South Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 360 patients with AH  of the second degree, steatosis and alcoholic HC of class A according to  Child-Pue participated in the study. The control group consisted of 120 patients  with peptic ulcer in remission and normal function of the liver. The patients'  treatment with enalapril (pharmacologically inactive prodrug), lisinopril  (biologically active substance), atenolol (hydrophilic drug) and metoprolol  (lipophylic drug) was analysed. RESULTS: Lisinopril showed a better hypotensive  effect than enalapril in AH patients with HC. BAB decreased blood pressure in all  hypertensive patients. Atenolol and metoprolol effectively reduced blood pressure  in 88.89% patients with AH and HC. Bradycardia episodes in atenolol treatment  were observed in 14.4% patients while in metoprolol treatment--in 22.2% patients,  this evidencing for pronounced shifts in pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol  exposed to hepatic metabolism. CONCLUSION: Biological activity is an essential  criterion of choice of ACE inhibitor in patients with hepatic pathology.  Enalapril, for example, as a pharmacological inactive prodrug, is metabolized in  the liver to acquire activity, whereas lisinopril has a direct biological  activity and has, therefore, a stronger hypotensive action in AH patients with  HC. BAB should be selected by the ability to effectively control blood pressure  and heart rate without inducing bradycardia the appearance of which necessitates  correction of dose regimen with reduction of day dose.","2011","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","49-55","","12","83","","Ter Arkh","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 22416445","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Treatment Outcome; Liver/metabolism; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Chronic Disease; Fatty Liver/*complications/metabolism; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Liver Cirrhosis/*complications/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Decreased myocardial  accumulation and enhanced washout of 123I-MIBG have been reported in patients  with congestive heart failure (CHF). The purpose of this study was to determine  whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduced 123I-MIBG release  and improved cardiac 123I-MIBG accumulation in patients with CHF. METHODS:  Twenty-nine patients receiving conventional treatment for CHF, New York Heart  Association (NYHA) functional class 2-3, were studied. Nineteen patients received  additional treatment with enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and 10 patients who were  treated with conventional therapy alone were defined as a control group.  Iodine-123-MIBG imaging and echocardiography were performed on all patients  before treatment and repeated after 9.1 +/- 3.0 mo of treatment. Images were  obtained 30 min and 4 hr after injection of 123I-MIBG, and a heart to mediastinum  (H/M) ratio was defined to quantify cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake as a fraction of the  mean counts per pixel in the heart divided by those in the mediastinum. The  washout rate of 123I-MIBG from the heart was calculated as follows: (early counts  - delayed counts)/early counts x 100(%). RESULTS: In patients with enalapril  group, the H/M ratio of 123I-MIBG was increased after treatment (early image:  1.60 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.73 +/- 0.28, p < 0.05, delayed image: 1.63 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.82  +/- 0.33, p < 0.01). The washout rate of 123I-MIBG was reduced from 38% +/- 11%  to 30% +/- 12% after treatment (p < 0.01). However in the conventional therapy  group, the H/M ratios in the early and delayed images (early image: 1.58 +/- 0.31  vs. 1.52 +/- 0.23, delayed image: 1.49 +/- 0.27 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.25) and the  washout rate (34% +/- 8% vs. 33% +/- 7%) remained unchanged after treatment. In  patients with an increased H/M ratio of enalapril group (n = 13), a left  ventricular ejection fraction increased from 48% +/- 12% to 55% +/- 9% (p < 0.01)  after treatment. CONCLUSION: ACE inhibition reduces cardiac 123I-MIBG release and  thus lowers cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. Iodine-123-MIBG may be helpful in  evaluating the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibition on the cardiac sympathetic  nervous system in patients with CHF.","1997-07","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1085-1089","","7","38","","J Nucl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9225795","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Myocardium/*metabolism; Radionuclide Imaging; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Iodine Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics; 3-Iodobenzylguanidine; Enalapril/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Iodobenzenes/*pharmacokinetics; Heart Failure/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Control mice (n = 10) received tap  water ad libitum. Immunocytochemical detection of renin confirmed that  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition resulted in recruitment of  renin-containing cells along the preglomerular vessels. Morphometric analysis of  glomeruli included assessment of glomerular diameter and the percentage of  mesangial area per glomerulus. Glomerular diameter and mesangial area were higher  in control mice (99.7 +/- 0.5 microns, 12.7 +/- 0.3%) than in enalapril-treated  mice (88 +/- 0.8 microns, 8.6 +/- 0.6%) (P < .05). Glomerular diameter and  mesangial area in the nifedipine-treated group (99.1 +/- 0.9 microns, 12.4 +/-  0.9%) were not different from control mice. These results demonstrate that  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition prevents the glomerular enlargement and  mesangial expansion observed during natural aging. In addition, control glomeruli  expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin in a mesangial distribution. This effect was  prevented by enalapril treatment but not by nifedipine. We conclude that  long-term treatment with enalapril from early life prevents the early changes  associated with glomerular injury and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin in  the glomerulus. alpha-Smooth muscle actin may participate in and serve as an  early marker of the glomerular injury during the normal aging process.","1994-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","889-893","","6 Pt 2","23","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8206623","","","","Reference Values; Animals; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Tissue Distribution; Aging/*metabolism; Muscle, Smooth/*metabolism; Enalapril/pharmacology; Nifedipine/pharmacology; Kidney Glomerulus/*metabolism; Actins/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A multicenter, randomised, double-blind  parallel group study was performed in Finland, France, the Netherlands, Spain and  Sweden. Three-hundred-and-ninety-five men and women in the age range 20-80 years  with primary hypertension were randomised to an 8-week double-blind treatment  period with either candesartan cilexetil 8-16 mg or enalapril 10-20 mg once  daily, with forced dose titration after 4 weeks. Non-invasive ambulatory blood  pressure was measured for 36 h at baseline and after 8 weeks. The primary  efficacy variable was the change in mean diastolic and systolic ambulatory blood  pressure 22-24 h post-dose. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the  adjusted mean difference for the change from baseline to week 8 between  candesartan cilexetil and enalapril 22-24 h post-dose by -3.5 mmHg (95%  confidence interval, CI: -6.8 to -0.3 mmHg; p < 0.032) in ambulatory systolic  blood pressure and -3.0 mmHg (95% CI: -5.1 to -0.8 mmHg; p < 0.008) in ambulatory  diastolic blood pressure. There was a significant difference in adjusted mean  daytime ambulatory blood pressure 24-36 h post-dose by -4.2 mmHg (95% CI: -6.8 to  -1.6 mmHg; p < 0.002)/-3.5 mmHg (95% CI: -5.1 to -1.8 mmHg; p < 0.001). Both  drugs were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study  suggest that advantages may be attributed to the use of candesartan cilexetil, as  compared to enalapril in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension.

Tyramine is an indirect  sympathomimetic agent which causes neuronal release of norepinephrine. Enalapril  and tyramine, alone and in combination, had no effect on glomerular filtration,  effective renal plasma flow or sodium excretion. Tyramine caused a significant  increase in urinary flow rate (p < 0.05) but this was not influenced by enalapril  pretreatment. The lack of effect of enalapril on the renal response to tyramine  contrasts with a previous study which examined the effect of enalapril on the  renal response to circulating norepinephrine.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of long-term ACE  inhibitors on endothelial nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and coronary microvascular  function in patients with syndrome X. After a 2-week washout period, 20 patients  with syndrome X were randomized to receive either enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, 5  mg twice daily (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) in a double-blind design for 8 weeks.  Another 6 age- and gender-matched subjects with negative treadmill exercise tests  were also studied as controls. Compared with control subjects, patients with  syndrome X had significantly reduced coronary flow reserve, reduced plasma levels  of nitrate and nitrite (NOx), and a reduced plasma L-arginine to asymmetric  dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio (an index of systemic NO metabolism), as well as  reduced endothelial function. These patients also had increased plasma levels of  ADMA, which is an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase and of von Willebrand  factor, a marker of endothelial injury. Baseline characteristics including  exercise performance and coronary flow reserve were similar between enalapril and  placebo groups. After an 8-week treatment period, exercise duration (p = 0.001)  and coronary flow reserve (p = 0.001) significantly improved with enalapril but  not with placebo. Enalapril treatment, but not placebo, reduced plasma von  Willebrand factor (p = 0.03) and ADMA levels (p = 0.01) and increased NOx levels  (p = 0.01) and the ratio of L-arginine to ADMA (p <0.01). In patients with  syndrome X, the plasma NOx level was positively and ADMA level inversely  correlated with coronary flow reserve before and after the treatment. In  conclusion, long-term ACE inhibitor treatment with enalapril improved coronary  microvascular function as well as myocardial ischemia in patients with syndrome  X. This may be related to the improvement of endothelial NO bioavailability with  the reduction of plasma ADMA levels.","2002-11-01","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","974-982","","9","90","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12398965","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Treatment Outcome; Biological Availability; Statistics as Topic; Exercise Test; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Nitric Oxide/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Time; Enalapril/pharmacokinetics; Arginine/*analogs & derivatives/*blood/*drug effects; Coronary Circulation/*drug effects/*physiology; Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/*metabolism; Microcirculation/*drug effects/*physiology; Microvascular Angina/*blood/*drug therapy; von Willebrand Factor/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the interrelationships of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, tissue injury,  infarct size, cardiac function, and collagen formation in humans. METHODS: Serum  and plasma samples were taken on 93 patients receiving thrombolytic treatment for  their first AMI. Collagen formation was evaluated by measuring concentrations of  serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP).

The  mechanism for this effect, including its relation to changes in baroreflex  activity, blood pressure variability, and suppression of ACE activity, remains  undefined. This study was designed to test the relation of these variables, which  may govern changes in autonomic activity, to the previously described increase in  parasympathetic tone. METHODS: Seven patients with heart failure received a  3-hour infusion of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat. Hemodynamic variables and  parameters of heart rate and blood pressure variability, baroreflex gain derived  from the interaction of heart rate and blood pressure variability, and serum ACE  activity were measured during and after the infusion. Measures of heart rate and  blood pressure variability were also compared against a historic control group.  RESULTS: Serum ACE activity was significantly suppressed throughout and after  enalaprilat infusion. Hemodynamic measures did not change other than a small  decline in right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. Parasympathetic  tone showed an initial significant increase with a peak at 2 hours but then  declined below baseline 8 hours after initiation of enalaprilat infusion.  Sympathetically influenced low-frequency heart rate variability was significantly  increased above baseline in the enalaprilat treatment group 8 hours after  initiation of the infusion. Baroreflex gain showed a significant trend to an  increase with the maximum value coinciding with the peak in parasympathetic tone.  There was no change in blood pressure variability in the enalaprilat group and no  change in baroreflex gain, heart rate variability, or blood pressure variability  in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Parasympathetic tone and baroreflex gain  increased with parenteral administration of an ACE inhibitor but subsequently  decreased below baseline values despite continued suppression of serum ACE  activity. The dissociation between ACE suppression and autonomic response to ACE  inhibition indicates that enzyme systems not reflected by plasma ACE activity or  independent from the classic pathways of angiotensin formation contribute to the  regulation of the autonomic response to ACE inhibition in patients with heart  failure. The absence of significant change in hemodynamic variables or in blood  pressure variability indicates that these autonomic changes are not an indirect  reflex response to ACE inhibitor-induced vasodilation or hemodynamic baroreceptor  stimulation.","2000-07","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","34-42","","1","140","","Am Heart J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10874261","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Analysis of Variance; Reference Values; Aged; Drug Administration Schedule; Infusions, Intravenous; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Heart Rate/*drug effects; Probability; Hemodynamics/physiology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Autonomic Nervous System/drug effects/physiology; Baroreflex/*drug effects/physiology; Enalaprilat/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics; Heart Failure/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because vascular inflammation contributes to adverse outcomes following acute  myocardial infarction (AMI), and angiotensin II influences inflammation at the  vascular level, we hypothesized that high-tissue penetrating ACE inhibitors would  provide more favorable effects on C-reactive protein (CRP) after AMI compared to  low-tissue penetrating ACE inhibitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized  open-label trial, patients received the high-tissue penetrating quinapril (n =  15) or low-tissue penetrating enalapril (n = 15) following AMI. C-reactive  protein was measured at baseline and periodically over 14 days following drug  initiation. All baseline characteristics and blood pressure response to treatment  between groups were equivalent. Prior to initiating study medication, CRP  concentrations (mg/g) were similar between enalapril and quinapril (0.327 +/-  0.571 versus 0.273 +/- 0.380, respectively, p = 0.77). The percent magnitude of  change in CRP concentrations favored quinapril at all time points, starting 12 h  after treatment initiation. When characterizing CRP production during treatments,  the time courses were significantly different and demonstrated lower CRP  concentrations with quinapril (p = 0.0107). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this  investigation into the importance of ACE inhibitor tissue penetration on a common  marker of vascular inflammation, suggests a potential vascular anti-inflammatory  benefit with a more highly tissue penetrating ACE inhibitor following AMI.  Further investigation into the true pharmacological similarities and differences  amongst this class of drugs is warranted.","2004-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","211-217","","4","15","","Coron Artery Dis","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2004 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15187573","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Inflammation; Chi-Square Distribution; C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Quinapril; Enalapril/*pharmacokinetics; Coronary Vessels/*drug effects; Myocardial Infarction/blood/*drug therapy; Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we aimed to optimize the manipulation  with these agents, and examine the possible mechanism of their effects on MAb  distribution.

A dose finding study of enalapril ranging from 3 to 300 microg  showed that 30 microg of enalapril in combination with AT-II infusion produced  the best improvement in tumor uptake of 99Tc-HSA without altering 201Tl  distribution, suggesting that the increase of vascular permeability was caused by  enalapril. AT-II infusion for longer than 1 h affected renal blood flow and  caused subcutaneous edema. Tumor uptake of (111)In-A7, a murine IgG1, was  1.62-fold improved 72 h postinjection (P < 0.001) and intratumoral distribution  became uniform with 2.0 microg/kg/min of AT-II for 1 h and 30 microg of  enalapril. Vessels in manipulated tumors were distended even 48 h after the  cessation of AT-II infusion. In conclusion, it was suggested that persistent  distension of tumor vessels and the increase of diffusive extravasation of MAb  caused by short-period-induced hypertension and inhibition of bradykinin  degradation produced favorable effect for the MAb distribution in tumors.","1998","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","551-559","","11-12","10","","Oncol Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10367936","","","","Female; Animals; Mice; Autoradiography; Tissue Distribution; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Serum Albumin/metabolism; Mice, Nude; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use; Transplantation, Heterologous; Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics; Radioimmunotherapy/*methods; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage; Enalapril/administration & dosage; Angiotensin II/administration & dosage; Colonic Neoplasms/*blood supply/*therapy; Extravasation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Materials; Thallium Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the  activity of apical and basolateral peptide transport, we first performed  pharmacokinetic analysis of transcellular transport of glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar)  in cell monolayers grown on porous membrane filters. Transcellular transport of  Gly-Sar at the medium pH 6 was greater in the apical-to-basolateral direction  than in the opposite direction. Influx clearance of Gly-Sar at the apical  membrane was much greater than basolateral influx and efflux clearance,  indicating that the apical peptide transporter plays an important role in  directional transcellular transport of the dipeptide across Caco-2 cell  monolayers. We then evaluated the effect of various compounds on the uptake of  Gly-Sar and levofloxacin at the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells. The apical  uptake of [3H]Gly-Sar was significantly inhibited by Ala-Ala, Gly-Sar, and also  levofloxacin, whereas that of [14C]levofloxacin was not inhibited by Ala-Ala and  Gly-Sar. On the other hand, the apical uptake of [14C]levofloxacin was inhibited  by nicotine, enalapril, fexofenadine, and L-carnitine. These findings indicated  that the apical uptake transporter of levofloxacin is distinct from the peptide  transporter in Caco-2 cells.","2008","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","373-378","","5","23","","Drug Metab Pharmacokinet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18974615","","","","Humans; Caco-2 Cells; Biological Transport/drug effects; Intestinal Absorption/physiology; Peptide Transporter 1; Symporters/*physiology; *Levofloxacin; Cell Compartmentation; Dipeptides/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Fluoroquinolones/pharmacology; Membrane Transport Proteins/physiology; Ofloxacin/*metabolism/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: We evaluated transcapillary skin NaF  leakage by fluorescence videodensitometry in 10 normoalbuminuric, 10  microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic men (diabetes duration > 10 years) and 10  healthy subjects. The microalbuminuric patients were restudied after 6 weeks  treatment with the ACE-inhibitor enalapril, 10 mg once daily. All measurements  were performed at a blood glucose level of 5 mmol L-1. RESULTS: Transcapillary  NaF leakage was strongly increased in normoalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients  compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.001) and was still further increased in  microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients (P < 0.01 compared to normoalbuminuric  patients). Enalapril reduced NaF leakage (P < 0.05), mean arterial blood pressure  (P < 0.05) and microalbuminuria (P < 0. 05). After treatment, NaF leakage was not  different from that in normoalbuminuric patients. CONCLUSIONS: Capillary  permeability, as determined by NaF leakage, is elevated in normoalbuminuric Type  1 diabetic patients with long-standing disease, and the excess elevation in  microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients is ameliorated by ACE-inhibition. Skin  NaF videodensitometry seems a useful tool to document capillary permeability in  intervention studies.","1999-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1035-1040","","12","29","","Eur J Clin Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10583451","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Microcirculation/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Skin/metabolism; Capillary Permeability/*drug effects; Enalapril/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Albuminuria/drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/drug therapy/*metabolism; Fluorescein/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured 2-deoxyglucose uptake by using L(6) skeletal muscle cells. In  the presence of 1 nmol/L of insulin, 1 micromol/L of enalaprilat enhanced  insulin-induced glucose uptake from 89.2+/-8. 1 to 138.0+/-13.6 pmol/h per mg  protein. The stimulation of glucose uptake with enalaprilat was blocked to  92.7+/-7.8 pmol/h per mg protein by 10 micromol/L HOE 140 (a BK B2 receptor  antagonist). In the presence of 1 nmol/L of insulin, exposure to 10 micromol/L BK  stimulated glucose uptake from 89.2+/-8.1 to 171.6+/-10.1 pmol/h per mg protein.  However, in the absence of insulin, BK could not enhance glucose uptake. One  hundred nanomoles per liter of tyrphostin A-23 and genistein, which are tyrosine  kinase inhibitors, significantly decreased the BK-induced glucose uptake from  142.0+/-8.4 to 87.6+/-6. 4 and 85.2+/-7.3 pmol/h per mg protein, respectively.  BK-induced glucose uptake was inhibited significantly by 10 micromol/L U73122 (a  phospholipase C antagonist) from 142.0+/-8.4 to 95.7+/-9.5 pmol/h per mg protein.

Studies were done repeatedly for up to 2  years during a controlled trial on the effect of enalapril on progression of  renal failure. The pattern of proteinuria was followed over the first 9 months.  At baseline, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 5 to 68 mL/min. Absolute  proximal tubular reabsorption rate of fluid (APR), estimated as the difference  between GFR and C(Li), was 1 to 54 mL/min. Calculated fractional proximal  reabsorption (FPR) was moderately subnormal. During the study, GFR decreased and  sodium clearance was unchanged; fractional excretion of sodium therefore  increased. In the group of patients randomized to treatment with enalapril (n =  34), GFR at 1 month was 83% (P < 0.001) and C(Li) was 88% (P < 0.01) of the  baseline values, APR and FPR had not changed significantly, and potassium  clearance was significantly decreased. Through the rest of the study period, APR  remained nearly unchanged and FPR even increased in the enalapril group. In the  group of patients randomized to treatment with conventional antihypertensive  drugs (n = 35), C(Li) was unchanged until severe reduction in GFR, APR and FPR  decreased gradually, and potassium clearance was almost unchanged. These  differences in tubular function between the two treatment regimens were  significant (P < 0.05). An unchanged or increased APR in either treatment regimen  was associated with a long-term slower progression of renal failure. Over 9  months, the 24-hour fractional clearance of albumin decreased in the ACE  inhibitor group (P < 0.01), whereas the clearances of immunoglobulin G and  retinol-binding protein were unchanged in this group. In the conventional group,  the fractional clearances of these three plasma proteins all increased. It is  concluded that in progressive chronic nephropathy ACE-inhibitor treatment was  associated with different adaptive tubular changes in the handling of sodium,  water, and protein compared with conventional antihypertensive therapy. During  ACE inhibition, the reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubule appeared to be  better preserved, which might be of importance for the beneficial effect of this  treatment in chronic renal disease.","1996-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","822-831","","6","28","","Am J Kidney Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8957033","","","","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Disease Progression; Absorption; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; Kidney Function Tests; Albumins/metabolism; Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma; Sodium/metabolism; Kidney Failure, Chronic/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Lithium/pharmacokinetics; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Immunoglobulin G/metabolism; Potassium/metabolism; Kidney Tubules/*physiopathology; Enalapril/*therapeutic use; Retinol-Binding Proteins/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seven  ACE inhibitors inhibited cardiac ACE to varying degrees due to differences in  uptake during perfusion through nonischemic rat hearts. Zofenopril-sulfhydryl and  fosinoprilic acid were the most effective of the free inhibitors. Among the  prodrugs, zofenopril and S-benzoylcaptopril, hydrolyzed rapidly by cardiac  esterase, were more effective than their component ACE-inhibitors, whereas  fosinopril, ramipril and enalapril were poorly active. For studies in ischemic  rat hearts, vehicle or drug treatment was initiated 10 min before a 25-min period  of global ischemia and during a 30-min reperfusion period. Of five unesterified  ACE inhibitors studied for anti-ischemic activity, only captopril and  zofenopril-sulfhydryl were found to improve postischemic contractile function and  reduce cell death in the isolated rat hearts. Fosinoprilic acid, ramiprilat and  enalaprilat were not cardioprotective at high perfusion concentrations, despite  the fact that nearly complete inhibition of cardiac ACE was achieved with all of  the compounds studied. The S-benzoyl prodrugs of zofenopril-sulfhydryl and  captopril were at least as potent as their component ACE inhibitors in reducing  ischemic-reperfusion damage in the same model. Neither zofenopril nor captopril,  however, had any effect on coronary flow before or after ischemia. Thus, it  appears that the cardioprotective effects of zofenopril and captopril are  independent of cardiac ACE inhibition or, at least, that ACE inhibition alone is  not sufficient. Both captopril and zofenopril are sulfhydryl-containing compounds  whereas the inactive compounds are not; and, thus, this group appears to be  important in mediating their cardioprotective actions.","1991-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","919-929","","3","257","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1646329","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Drug Stability; Coronary Disease/drug therapy; Pyrroles/pharmacology; *Fosinopril/*analogs & derivatives; *Ramipril/*analogs & derivatives; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Captopril/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Enalaprilat/pharmacology; Heart/*drug effects; Myocardium/*enzymology/metabolism; Organophosphorus Compounds/pharmacology; Prodrugs/pharmacology; Proline/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tenapanor is an  inhibitor of the sodium-proton (Na(+)/H(+)) exchanger NHE3, which plays a  prominent role in sodium handling in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney. When  administered orally to rats, tenapanor acted exclusively in the gastrointestinal  tract to inhibit sodium uptake. We showed that the systemic availability of  tenapanor was negligible through plasma pharmacokinetic studies, as well as  autoradiography and mass balance studies performed with (14)C-tenapanor. In  humans, tenapanor reduced urinary sodium excretion by 20 to 50 mmol/day and led  to an increase of similar magnitude in stool sodium. In salt-fed nephrectomized  rats exhibiting hypervolemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arterial stiffening,  tenapanor reduced extracellular fluid volume, left ventricular hypertrophy,  albuminuria, and blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. We observed these  effects whether tenapanor was administered prophylactically or after disease was  established. In addition, the combination of tenapanor and the blood pressure  medication enalapril improved cardiac diastolic dysfunction and arterial pulse  wave velocity relative to enalapril monotherapy in this animal model. Tenapanor  prevented increases in glomerular area and urinary KIM-1, a marker of renal  injury. The results suggest that therapeutic alteration of sodium transport in  the gastrointestinal tract instead of the kidney--the target of current  drugs--could lead to improved sodium management in renal disease.","2014-03-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","227ra36","","227","6","","Sci Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24622516","","","","Humans; Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Disease Models, Animal; Healthy Volunteers; Dogs; Feces; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Nephrectomy; Hypertrophy; Intestines/drug effects; Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism; Sodium/*metabolism; Electrolytes/urine; Enalapril/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Albuminuria/complications/drug therapy/physiopathology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Isoquinolines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Kidney/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology; Myocardium/metabolism/*pathology; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/drug therapy/physiopathology; Sodium Chloride, Dietary/administration & dosage/pharmacology; Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 3; Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Myocardial 123I-beta-methyl-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid  (123I-BMIPP) imaging was performed in 25 patients with CHF and in 10 control  subjects. Myocardial 123I-BMIPP images were obtained 30 min and 4 h after tracer  injection. The heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio of 123I-BMIPP uptake and the  washout rate of 123I-BMIPP from the myocardium were calculated. Patients were  given enalapril for 6 months, and 123I-BMIPP imaging was repeated. H/M ratios on  early and delayed images were lower in CHF patients than in normal controls  (P<0.01). The washout rate of 123I-BMIPP from the myocardium was faster in CHF  patients than in controls (P<0.01). As the severity of the New York Heart  Association (NYHA) functional class increased, the H/M ratio decreased and the  washout rate increased. The washout rate of 123I-BMIPP was inversely correlated  with left ventricular fractional shortening (R=-0.62, P<0.01). ACE inhibition  with enalapril increased the H/M ratio on delayed images (P<0.05) and reduced the  washout rate of 123I-BMIPP (P<0.05) in CHF patients. These data suggest that: (1)  angiotensin II-mediated intracellular signalling activation may be a possible  mechanism for the decreased myocardial uptake and enhanced washout of 123I-BMIPP  in heart failure patients; and (2) the improvement in fatty acid metabolism by  ACE inhibition may represent a new mechanism for the beneficial effect of this  therapy in heart failure.","2003-08","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","901-906","","8","24","","Nucl Med Commun","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12869823","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Myocardium/*metabolism; Radionuclide Imaging; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage; Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics; Enalapril/*administration & dosage; Heart Failure/drug therapy/*metabolism; *Iodobenzenes/pharmacokinetics; Fatty Acids/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Heart/*diagnostic imaging/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonextraction equilibrium assays using antibodies with a high specificity for  spirapril or spiraprilate were used, with charcoal separation of bound and free  tracer. Within-assay reproducibility (CV%) was less than 20% in the concentration  range 0.5-40 micrograms/L for both analytes and the comparable value for  between-assay reproducibility was less than 25%. Results for external quality  control samples were in good agreement with the expected values of 0-250  micrograms/L (spirapril, r = 0.997) and 0-300 micrograms/L (spiraprilate, r =  0.999). Overall, samples circulated to four laboratories gave good agreement for  measured values, including one center using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  analysis for the two compounds.

After a 4-week placebo run-in, they received  temocapril, 20 mg daily (n = 19), or placebo (n = 11) for 6 weeks. Insulin  sensitivity index (SI), determined by the Minimal Model method of Bergman, serum  lipoproteins, plasma renin activity, fibrinogen, and microalbuminuria were  assessed at the end of the placebo run-in phase and the double-blind treatment  phases. Temocapril but not placebo administration produced a significant decrease  in supine BP (152/92+/-5/3 vs. 162/98+/-5/2 mm Hg; p < 0.01) and increase in  plasma renin (p < 0.05).

The inhibitory potency of CS-622 diacid on isolated  rat aorta was 3 times that of enalaprilat. The inhibitory action of enalaprilat  was abolished quickly by washing the aortic strip with drug-free solution,  whereas that of CS-622 diacid was abolished only slowly.

By oral  administration, CS-622 was 3 times more potent than enalapril, and its onset of  action was faster than that of enalapril, suggesting that the conversion of  CS-622 to its active diacid occurs faster than the conversion of enalapril.  Although CS-622 diacid was only slightly more potent than enalaprilat by  intravenous administration, it had a longer duration than enalaprilat.  Elimination of renal excretory function potentiated the action of captopril but  not that of CS-622, suggesting that unlike captopril, only a small portion of  CS-622 is excreted through the kidney.","1988-11","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","349-356","","3","48","","Jpn J Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 2851680","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Rats, Inbred Strains; Prodrugs; Muscle Contraction/drug effects; Lung/enzymology; Enalaprilat; Enalapril/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Aorta/drug effects; Thiazepines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND: Intracoronary angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been  shown to relieve myocardial ischemia in stable patients and to improve epicardial  flow in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Yet, it is  still unclear whether these effects are mediated by a modulation of the coronary  microcirculation. METHODS: We randomly assigned 40 patients to receive either an  intracoronary bolus of enalaprilat (50 μg) or placebo before elective PCI. The  index of microvascular resistance was measured at baseline, 10 minutes after  study drug administration, and after PCI. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T was  measured as a marker of myocardial injury. RESULTS: Infusion of enalaprilat  resulted in a significant reduction in index of microvascular resistance (27 ± 11  at baseline vs. 19 ± 9 after drug vs. 15 ± 8 after PCI), whereas a significant  post-procedural increase in index of microvascular resistance levels was observed  in the placebo group (24 ± 15 at baseline vs. 24 ± 15 after drug vs. 33 ± 19  after PCI). Index of microvascular resistance levels after PCI were significantly  lower in the enalaprilat group (p < 0.001). Patients pre-treated with enalaprilat  also showed lower peak values (mean: 21.7 ng/ml, range: 8.2 to 34.8 ng/ml vs.  mean: 32.3 ng/ml, range: 12.6 to 65.2 ng/ml, p = 0.048) and peri-procedural  increases of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (mean: 9.9 ng/ml, range: 2.7 to  19.0 ng/ml vs. mean: 26.6 ng/ml, range: 6.3 to 60.5 ng/ml, p = 0.025).  CONCLUSIONS: Intracoronary enalaprilat improves coronary microvascular function  and protects myocardium from procedure-related injury in patients with coronary  artery disease undergoing PCI. Larger studies are warranted to investigate  whether these effects of enalaprilat could result into a significant clinical  benefit.","2013-02-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","615-621","","6","61","","J Am Coll Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using  Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) pharmacy claims data.  Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) treatment card holders with at least two  dispensings of atenolol, citalopram, enalapril, metformin, omeprazole or ramipril  between 1 January 2001 and 28 February 2006 were included.

Based on  this, patients were defined as non-switchers, brand substitution or multiple  switchers. RESULTS: Data for 160,145 patients were analysed. Overall more than  80% of patients either had no switches or demonstrated brand substitution. For  all study drugs, patients were more likely to be non-switchers than have a brand  substitution (RR range 2.6-9.4, p < 0.0001) and were more likely to be  non-switchers than multiple switchers (RR range 3.2-35.9, p < 0.0001).

Their absorption values were in the range of 25-60%, while  calculated KOWWIN logP values were from -0.94 to 6.61. Additionally, perindopril  (absorption 70%, KOWWIN logP 2.59) and moexipril (absorption 22%, KOWWIN logP  3.36) were introduced for the theoretical considerations due to their high/low  absorption values which were on the opposite sites in comparison with the  majority of ACE inhibitors (25-60%). In the theoretical considerations it was  shown that the solubility data (logS) must be considered, as independent  variable, simultaneously with KOWWIN logP to obtain reliable correlation  (r(2)=0.7208) between absorption and ACE inhibitors lipophilicity. As the main  topic of this study, the relationships between literature available and  absorption data predicted by multiple linear regression (MLR) using logS values  besides chromatographically obtained hydrophobicity parameters C(0) (r(2)=0.6424)  or φ(0) (r(2)=0.6762) were studied proving that these parameters could be used in  ACE inhibitors absorption evaluation. The UHPLC-MS method provides the direct  application of experimentally obtained φ(0) values that is the advantage of this  method. For better MLR correlation of ACE inhibitors absorption with C(0)  parameters (RP-TLC) and logS, mathematical conversion of C(0) parameters to  logC(0) values was necessary based on requisite for probability value of  regression analysis (P<0.05).

After completion of the  administration period, the degree of renal injury was examined  histopathologically using indices of glomerulosclerosis and lesions of the renal  tubule and interstitium. An immunohistochemical staining for transforming growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta1) was also performed. The suppression of urinary protein  was statistically significant in surviving animals dosed with telmisartan. The  enalapril group's urinary protein was also significantly suppressed for these  same parameters in surviving animals. Histopathologically, telmisartan  significantly decreased the progression of glomerulosclerosis and the  interstitial cell infiltration at all doses tested. As assessed by  immunohistochemical staining the TGF-beta1 reactivity in the glomerular tissue  tended to decrease in the telmisartan group when compared to the vehicle group.  Thus, telmisartan ameliorates the progressive nephropathy in the remaining kidney  after 5/6 Nx by non-haemodynamic as well as antihypertensive actions of the drug.","2007-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","93-100","","2","8","","J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17703436","","","","Animals; Rats; Disease Models, Animal; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Enalapril/therapeutic use; Telmisartan; Kidney/pathology; Benzimidazoles/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; *Nephrectomy; Diabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Benzoates/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As compared to pretreatment values, spirapril significantly decreased mean  arterial (-19%, peak effect), right atrial (-42%), mean pulmonary arterial (-38%)  and pulmonary capillary wedge (-46%) pressures. Spirapril significantly decreased  heart rate (-14%) and increased stroke volume index (+43%) thus resulting in a  slight increase in cardiac index. All these effects were maximal between 2.5 and  4 h. Brachial artery diameter (+12%) and brachial (+41%) and renal (+36%) blood  flows increased significantly whereas brachial (-41%) and renal (-36%) vascular  resistances decreased significantly. All these effects were usually maximal  between 1 and 2.5 h. Hepato-splanchnic hemodynamics were not drug-affected.  Spirapril significantly inhibited plasma converting enzyme activity (-96% at 4  h), increased plasma renin activity (+505% at 4 h), and decreased plasma  aldosterone (-46% at 24 h), norepinephrine (-31% at 24 h) and atrial natriuretic  factor (-33% at 7 h). Thus, in severe CHF, acute administration of spirapril, 6  mg orally, exerts both arterial and venous vasodilating properties and improves  both the systemic and regional hemodynamics and the biological status of the  patients.","1996","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","127-135","","2","10","","Fundam Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8737955","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use; Vasodilation/drug effects; Liver Circulation/drug effects; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Hemodynamics/*drug effects; Pulmonary Wedge Pressure/drug effects; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Enalapril/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Pulmonary Circulation/drug effects; Brachial Artery/drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is unsubstantiated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  Because vascular tissue is a source of the endogenous fibrinolytic markers, and  ACE inhibition in vascular tissue favorably influences the fibrinolytic system,  the authors hypothesized that a high-tissue-penetrating ACE inhibitor would  provide a more favorable reduction in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)  and an increase in tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) after AMI compared to a  low-tissue-penetrating ACE inhibitor. In a randomized open-label trial, patients  received the high-tissue-penetrating quinapril (n = 15) or low-tissue-penetrating  enalapril (n = 15) immediately following an AMI. PAI-1 and t-PA antigen (ng/mL)  were measured at baseline and through 14 days of treatment. There was no  difference in baseline PAI-1 or t-PA antigen between treatments. PAI-1 antigen  trended toward being lower with quinapril versus enalapril on day 1 (24.44 +/-  14.96 vs. 36.94 +/- 19.49, respectively, p = 0.059) and was significantly lower  on day 3 (17.32 +/- 9.57 vs. 27.49 +/- 9.61, respectively, p = 0.009). Analysis  of PAI-1 antigen over time by two-factor ANOVA with replication found  significantly lower concentrations of PAI-1 antigen over the entire treatment  period with quinapril versus enalapril (p < 0.003). This investigation of ACE  inhibitor tissue-penetrating influence on markers of reinfarction risk suggests  there may be a greater early reduction in PAI-1 with a more highly  tissue-penetrating ACE inhibitor.","2004-02","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","150-157","","2","44","","J Clin Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 14747423","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Analysis of Variance; Permeability; Quinapril; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Myocardial Infarction/drug therapy/*metabolism; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*biosynthesis; Tetrahydroisoquinolines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*biosynthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The desolvated lattice can reduce its internal energy  by either resorbing solvent or by relaxation processes which increase the packing  efficiency of the solid by reducing the unit cell volume. In the following paper,  solid-state properties of isomorphic desolvates of cephalexin, cefaclor,  erythromycin A, and spirapril hydrochloride hydrates are investigated.

Rats were either sham operated or were subjected to 1 1/3 nephrectomy (4/6 Nx). Each group was either  untreated or was treated with enalapril (EN) or the drug regimen of hydralazine,  hydrochlorothiazide, and reserpine (HHR). Four weeks after surgery rats were  injected with iodinated aggregated bovine serum albumin (I-aggBSA) and mesangial  localization quantified 2, 4, or 8 h later. Mesangial kinetics in untreated 4/6  Nx rats were characterized by accumulation of I-aggBSA to 4 h after injection  with rapid clearance over the 4-8-h period; i.e. mesangial trafficking was  increased following 4/6 Nx. Mesangial trafficking in 4/6 Nx rats treated with EN  was reduced by virtue of lesser uptake of I-aggBSA at 4 h and retarded clearance  over 4-8 h when compared with untreated 4/6 Nx animals. Treatment of 4/6 Nx rats  with HHR maintained the increased trafficking observed in untreated 4/6 Nx rats.  At 30 weeks untreated 4/6 Nx rats had severe albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis.  Both indices of renal damage were significantly less in 4/6 Nx rats treated with  enalapril. Treatment with HHR did not prevent albuminuria and had only limited  effectiveness in preventing glomerulosclerosis. The different effects of EN and  HHR on mesangial trafficking and glomerulosclerosis provide further evidence for  a relationship between mesangial trafficking following partial renal ablation and  subsequent development of glomerulosclerosis.","1994","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","131-137","","2","9","","Nephrol Dial Transplant","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 8190327","","","","Male; Kinetics; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Tissue Distribution; Biological Transport, Active; Kidney Glomerulus/pathology; Hypertrophy; Albuminuria/etiology/prevention & control; Enalapril/pharmacology; Hydralazine/pharmacology; Reserpine/pharmacology; Hydrochlorothiazide/pharmacology; Antihypertensive Agents/classification/*pharmacology; Glomerular Mesangium/*drug effects/*metabolism; Nephrectomy/adverse effects; Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that gender influences the effect of ACEI on t-PA  release. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured the effect of intra-arterial  enalaprilat (0.33 microg/min per 100 mL forearm volume) on forearm blood flow  (FBF) and net t-PA release before and during BK (25 to 400 ng/min) and  methacholine (3.2 to 12.8 microg/min) in premenopausal women, postmenopausal  women not using hormone replacement, young men, and older men. Baseline net t-PA  release was similar among groups. Enalaprilat increased basal t-PA release in  premenopausal (from 0.9+/-1.0 to 5.1+/-1.7 ng/min per 100 mL, P=0.023) and  postmenopausal women (from -3.9+/-2.2 to 3.9+/-1.1 ng/min per 100 mL, P=0.010)  but not in young or older men (P=0.028 men versus women). Enalaprilat potentiated  the effect of exogenous BK on FBF similarly in all groups. However, during  enalaprilat, BK-stimulated t-PA release was greatest in premenopausal women  (339.9+/-86.4 ng/min per 100 mL at the 100 ng/min dose, P<0.05 versus any other  group), intermediate in postmenopausal women (243.8+/-51.1 ng/min per 100 mL,  P<0.05 versus either male group), and least in young (111.9+/-19.2 ng/min/100 mL)  and older men (103.4+/-27.6 ng/min/100 mL).

We performed electron microscopy immunocytochemistry in kidney  sections of 10-day-old (newborn) and adult Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats using specific  antibodies to renin, ANG I, ANG II, and angiotensinogen (AO). Renin, ANG I, ANG  II, and AO were present in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. Renin was largely confined  to cytoplasmic granules; ANG I and ANG II were colocalized to these granules but  also were present in the cytoplasm; AO was distributed throughout the cytoplasm.  AO also was present in a renal cortical distribution in proximal tubular cells.  Northern blot analysis demonstrated AO mRNA in total kidney and liver but not in  renal microvessels. Using the reverse hemolytic plaque assay, we demonstrated  release of ANG I and renin from individual renocortical cells of adult WKY rats.  Under control conditions, the number of releasing cells was 11 +/- 1 for ANG I  and 10 +/- 1 for renin. Addition of rat renin inhibitor (RI) (1 x 10(-5) M),  which inhibited renin activity in the medium from 37 to 9 pg ANG I.ml-1.h-1, did  not alter ANG I plaque number. Addition of rat AO increased ANG I plaque number  to 17 +/- 2 (P less than 0.05). Incubation with both RI and AO prevented the  increase in ANG I plaque number obtained with AO alone. Enalapril treatment (7  days; n = 5) increased the number of plaque-forming cells to 22 +/- 2 for ANG I  (P less than 0.0005) and to 39 +/- 7 for renin (P less than 0.001). The results  suggest an intracellular location for AO and angiotensin and release of renin and  ANG I by renal cortical cells and suggest that released angiotensin is produced  intracellularly and that secretion of ANG I is augmented by converting enzyme  inhibition.","1992-09","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","F363-373","","3 Pt 2","263","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1415565","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Immunohistochemistry; Tissue Distribution; Microscopy, Electron; Angiotensin II/*metabolism; Rats, Inbred WKY; Enalapril/pharmacology; Angiotensinogen/metabolism; Microscopy, Immunoelectron; Angiotensin I/*metabolism; Hemolytic Plaque Technique; Kidney Cortex/cytology/*metabolism; Renin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I came away with the impression that  although there might be variations with renal function, hypotension and so on,  most of you felt that it was ACE inhibition that was of primary importance, and  that it was therefore permissible to extrapolate from one study to another. The  recently published AIRE study of post-infarct patients used ramipril, with a  change in mortality that gives credence to the idea that it's not just captopril,  not just enalapril, but is likely to be a class effect of ACE inhibitors. I think  that's the feeling I got from you. Do ACE inhibitors prolong life? I think  Professor Weich made a very simple and a very good point, because it allowed us a  general extrapolation. The simple point is: the sicker the patient, certainly  with heart failure, the more the benefit of the ACE inhibitor. It's like the idea  that in elderly hypertensives, or the diabetic hypertensive, the greater the risk  factor the greater the benefit. The more we want to treat prophylactically,  whether it's micro-albuminuria, or transient hypertension, or minimal left  ventricular dysfunction, the longer we will have to treat, and the more patients  we will have to treat to get objective evidence of any differences.

Measurements of CE activity and angiotensin II concentrations  revealed that after oral administration of CE inhibitors, CE was inhibited not  only in lung vascular endothelium and blood, but also in the heart, kidney,  vascular wall, brain and other organs. The functional significance of tissue CE  inhibition is suggested first by the antihypertensive effect of brain CE  inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats, second by the concomitant  persistence of blood pressure decrease and CE inhibition in vascular wall and  kidney after long-term oral CE inhibitor treatment and third by ex vivo  experiments demonstrating marked effects of oral CE inhibitor pretreatment on  cardiac function in isolated rat hearts. Local inhibition of tissue  renin-angiotensin systems may be an important factor involved in the beneficial  effects of CE inhibitors in such cardiovascular diseases as arterial  hypertension, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.","1987-04-24","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","18D-22D","","10","59","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3034027","","","","Animals; Rats; Rabbits; Administration, Oral; Tissue Distribution; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Injections, Intraventricular; Ramipril; Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/pharmacology; Captopril/pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacology; Myocardium/enzymology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*metabolism; Rats, Inbred SHR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acute vs. chronic physiological alterations of  glomerular hemodynamics that result from inhibition of either PG or ANG II, or  both, and their interaction were examined. Four groups of Munich-Wistar rats were  submitted to the following micropuncture studies in euvolemic conditions for  measurements of glomerular hemodynamics and tubular fluid reabsorption: 1) an  untreated control group, 2) 4- to 6-day inhibition of both PG and  angiotensin-converting enzyme activity with meclofenamate and MK-421 (enalapril),  3) 4- to 6-day treatment with enalapril followed by acute PG inhibition in the  second measurement period, 4) 4- to 6-day PG inhibition followed by acute  enalapril treatment in the second period. Dual 4- to 6-day treatment decreased  single-nephron filtration rate (SNGFR, 24 +/- 2 vs. 33 +/- 2 nl/min in control; P  less than 0.05) as a result of decreases in single-nephron plasma flow (SNPF) and  glomerular hydrostatic pressure gradient (delta P). Treatment with enalapril  alone for 4-6 days did not reduce SNGFR and SNPF; however, delta P decreased.  Acute addition of meclofenamate did not alter these factors. SNGFR was decreased  with 4- to 6-day treatment of meclofenamate from 33 +/- 2 in control to 25 +/- 1  nl/min (P less than 0.05). Acute treatment with enalapril in the 4- to 6-day  meclofenamate-treated rats increased SNGFR to values not different from control.  The results demonstrated that glomerular hemodynamic alterations consequent to  inhibition of ANG II and PG systems differ between chronic and acute treatments.  Therefore, interpretation of the role of individual hormonal systems in the  control of glomerular hemodynamics should be approached with caution, since  effects may be altered by duration of treatment and involvement of other  vasoactive systems.","1990-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","F1026-1035","","4 Pt 2","258","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2330970","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Rats, Inbred Strains; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Absorption; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/metabolism; Prostaglandin Antagonists/*pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacology; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Loop of Henle/metabolism; Angiotensin II/*antagonists & inhibitors; Kidney Glomerulus/*blood supply; Kidney Tubules/*blood supply; Meclofenamic Acid/pharmacology; Nephrons/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND:  Bradykinin responses are depressed in hypertension, and endothelial dysfunction  contributes to myocardial ischemia by promoting abnormal coronary vasomotion  during stress. METHODS: Fourteen hypertensive (HT) and 17 normotensive (NT),  mildly symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and ST-segment  depression during exercise were studied before and after seven days of oral  enalapril (EN), which was titrated from 2.5 to 20 mg daily. Patients underwent  two treadmill exercise tests and determination of forearm vasodilator response to  BK. RESULTS: Despite receiving a lower dose of EN (7.8 vs. 14.8 mg, p < 0.001),  NT patients had a significant reduction in blood pressure compared to HT  patients. Compared to pre-EN, the ischemic threshold, defined as the  rate-pressure product at the onset of 1-mm ST depression (p = 0.045), the  duration of exercise to 1-mm ST depression (180 +/- 54 s, p = 0.007) and the  maximum exercise duration (94 +/- 18 s, p < 0.001) were greater after EN in HT  patients, but not in NT subjects (all p > or = 0.3). Patients with a greater drop  in blood pressure experienced no improvement in exercise-induced ischemia.  Forearm blood flow responses to BK were improved with EN in all patients to a  similar extent. Moreover, no correlation was observed between the basal response  to BK or the magnitude of its improvement with EN and with either the dose of EN  or the improvement in exercise ischemic threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-induced  myocardial ischemia is ameliorated in HT patients with CAD by ACE inhibition.","2001-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1116-1122","","4","38","","J Am Coll Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11583891","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Biological Availability; Exercise Test; Hypertension/*physiopathology; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Vasodilation/drug effects; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Enalapril/*pharmacology; Bradykinin/pharmacokinetics; Myocardial Ischemia/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  employed rats with myocardial infarction (MI) to examine effects of an  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, imidapril, on SR Ca(2+) transport,  protein content, and gene expression. Imidapril (1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) was given  for 4 wk starting 3 wk after coronary artery occlusion. Infarcted rats exhibited  a fourfold increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, whereas rates of  pressure development and decay were decreased by 60 and 55%, respectively. SR  Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) pump ATPase, as well as Ca(2+) release and ryanodine  receptor binding activities, were depressed in the failing hearts; protein  content and mRNA levels for Ca(2+) pump ATPase, phospholamban, and ryanodine  receptor were also decreased by approximately 55-65%. Imidapril treatment of  infarcted animals improved cardiac performance and attenuated alterations in SR  Ca(2+) pump and Ca(2+) release activities. Changes in protein content and mRNA  levels for SR Ca(2+) pump ATPase, phospholamban, and ryanodine receptor were also  prevented by imidapril treatment. Beneficial effects of imidapril on cardiac  function and SR Ca(2+) transport were not only seen at different intervals of MI  but were also simulated by another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor,  enalapril, and an ANG II receptor antagonist, losartan. These results suggest  that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the abundance of mRNA  for SR proteins and, thus, may prevent the depression in SR Ca(2+) transport and  improve cardiac function in congestive heart failure due to MI.","2005-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","H1674-1682","","4","288","","Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15576437","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tritium; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacology; Gene Expression/drug effects/physiology; Losartan/pharmacology; Calcium-Transporting ATPases/genetics/metabolism; Calcium/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics; Cardiomegaly/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology; Imidazolidines/*pharmacology; Myocardial Infarction/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/genetics/metabolism; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/*physiology; Ventricular Pressure/drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Establishing, for a range of antihypertensive  agents, that there is a clear relationship between the circulating drug  concentration and blood pressure-lowering effect it is possible to demonstrate  that the pharmacodynamic characteristics of a drug will be well correlated with  its pharmacokinetics.

J-104132 (1 mg/kg i.v.) administered after enalaprilat (0.05 mg/kg i.v.) induced  further decreases in MAP, PCWP and PAP, and further increases in CO, resulting in  further decreases in total peripheral resistance.

We describe our experience in a  series of experiments in rats. Three weeks after MI, infarct size (IS) was  determined by MRI and the rats were divided into two groups with equal IS. Three  weeks later, treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  spirapril (10 mg/kg in food) or placebo was started.

After 3-week treatment, no significant  differences with respect to heart structure and function were detected as  compared with those of untreated animals. Prolonged treatment for 10 weeks with  spirapril resulted in significant reduction of LV dilatation, LV mass, and LV  end-systolic and end-diastolic volume, which was accompanied by improved EF.  Hemodynamic examinations after treatment for 6 months showed, in contrast to  control animals, no increase in right ventricular systolic pressure in animals  receiving spirapril. Furthermore, histologic examination of perfusion-fixed  hearts at the end of the study demonstrated more pronounced LV dilatation in  control animals, thus confirming the in vivo MRI data.

By i.v. infusion of the  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (100 micrograms bolus; 100  micrograms/h) we examined the role of angiotensin II for the compensatory renal  responses occurring during furosemide administration in conscious rats. To  evaluate the significance of hydration for the compensatory renal effects of  angiotensin II, experiments were performed in groups of rats with or without i.v.  replacement of urinary volume losses. Furosemide was administered i.v. (6  mg/kg/h) for 3 1/2 hr. Furosemide infusion produced a short-lasting increase in  urine flow rate, Na, Li and K excretion after which the renal excretion rates  returned toward pretreatment levels, along with significant reductions in  effective renal plasma flow and GFR and increases in effective filtration  fraction and effective renal vascular resistance. Sustained increases in urine  flow and urinary excretion rates of Na, Li and K were observed in absence of  changes in GFR in rats given furosemide with volume replacement. Enalaprilat did  not alter the tubular response to furosemide during either euvolemia or volume  depletion. However, enalaprilat attenuated the furosemide-induced increases in  effective filtration fraction and effective renal vascular resistance. It is  concluded that angiotensin II is not essential for the compensatory response of  decreased GFR and increased tubular Na reabsorption. However, angiotensin II is  an important mediator of renal vasoconstriction during furosemide infusion.","1993-07","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","33-40","","1","266","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8392557","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Time Factors; Drug Interactions; Rats, Wistar; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Heart Rate/drug effects; Absorption; Solutions; Potassium/blood; Consciousness; Angiotensin II/metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Water/metabolism; Enalaprilat/pharmacology; Renal Circulation/drug effects; Furosemide/*pharmacology; Adaptation, Physiological/drug effects; Body Fluids/physiology; Kidney Tubules/drug effects/enzymology/physiology; Kidney/*drug effects/enzymology/*physiology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood/metabolism; Sodium/blood/pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased absorption following  intravenous infusion of angiotensin peptides may be secondary to an increase in  ion transport. To test this hypothesis, the effect of angiotensin peptides on ion  and water absorption from the isolated jejunum was studied. At a dose of 100 pM,  serosal addition of ANG II stimulated jejunal Na and water absorption. In  contrast, mucosal additions of the peptide were ineffective at doses up to 1  microM. ANG II enhanced jejunal absorption in the presence of prazosin. Thus ANG  II does not appear to stimulate absorption from the isolated intestine through  mediation of sympathetic fibers. ANG III and the substituted analogue  [Sar1,Leu8]ANG II stimulated jejunal absorption at a dose of 100 pM. At a dose of  1 nM ANG I also stimulated jejunal absorption. The effect of ANG I on absorption  could be prevented by prior treatment of the animals with the converting enzyme  inhibitor MK 422. Thus ANG I must first be converted to ANG II to stimulate  jejunal absorption.","1986-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","G559-566","","4 Pt 1","251","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3020993","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Nephrectomy; Intestinal Absorption/*drug effects; Jejunum/drug effects/*metabolism; Sodium/metabolism; Adrenalectomy; Water/metabolism; Enalaprilat; Enalapril/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Chlorides/metabolism; Potassium/metabolism; Angiotensin I/pharmacology; Angiotensin II/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Angiotensin III/pharmacology; Angiotensins/*pharmacology; Prazosin/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  study investigated the ability of captopril, enalaprilat, and N-acetylcysteine to  prevent tertbutyl hydroperoxide induced oxidative injury in rat renal  homogenates. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in homogenates from  captopril-treated animals (p < 0.05), and following glutathione depletion this  was further enhanced (p < 0.001). Renal glutathione content was significantly  reduced by captopril treatment (p < 0.01).

Since potassium (K+) depletion also stimulates renin and induces  hypertrophy of the JGA, we examined the ability of this maneuver to stimulate  TGF-beta isoforms and renin in renovascular tissue and the JGA of young rats.  Sprague-Dawley rats (50 +/- 5 g) were fed either a control diet or a  potassium-deficient diet (< 0.05% K+) for 7, 16, or 21 days. As a control for  TGF-beta and renin stimulation, an additional group of animals was fed a normal  diet but was water deprived for three days. Potassium-depleted animals  experienced severe growth retardation but kidney weight increased significantly.  Potassium depletion induced both TGF-beta 2 and renin immunoreactivity in renal  arterioles and the JGA but had no effect on TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 3 isoforms.  To determine the role of circulating angiotensin II in the stimulation of  TGF-beta 2 by potassium depletion, a group of potassium-depleted rats received  enalapril (100 mg/liter) in the drinking water. The addition of converting enzyme  inhibitor increased both the intensity of TGF-beta 2 and renin staining as well  as the number of cells positively stained. Our results demonstrate that K+  depletion induces TGF-beta 2 and renin in renal arterioles and in the JGA.  Furthermore, circulating angiotensin II is not responsible for the increase in  the local expression of TGF-beta 2.

We investigated the transport  mechanism using intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbits and  observed that enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and substrate  of the peptide carrier, noncompetitively inhibited the uptake of cephradine, an  aminocephalosporin and substrate of the peptide carrier, with an inhibition  constant (Ki) of 2.6 mM when it was present on the cis side (outside) of the  vesicles. By contrast, enalaprilat, cefadroxil and GlyPro competitively inhibited  cephradine transport with Ki values of 5.4, 3.8 and 5.1, respectively. These  results suggest the presence of an enalapril-specific inhibitory binding site on  the peptide carrier. In addition, enalapril on the trans side (inside) of the  vesicles inhibited the uptake of cephradine, suggesting an apparent reduction of  carrier availability by a trapping mechanism. On the other hand, cefadroxil  stimulated the uptake of cephradine in the trans experiment, consistent with the  concept of countertransport. These findings reveal the uniqueness of enalapril  regarding its mode of interaction with the peptide carrier(s) which has been of  increasing interest regarding its role in the intestinal absorption of  peptide-type drugs.","1994-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1107-1111","","3","269","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 8014854","","","","Male; Animals; Rabbits; In Vitro Techniques; Drug Interactions; Binding Sites; Biological Transport/drug effects; *Membrane Transport Proteins; Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism; Carrier Proteins/*metabolism; Microvilli/metabolism; Intestines/ultrastructure; Enalapril/*pharmacology; Cephradine/*pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, VE of a donor animal failed to alter jejunal  absorption in a recipient following cross circulation. Thus, a hormonal factor is  not implicated in the jejunal response to VE. Additional experiments demonstrated  that rats ingesting a high-Na diet exhibited levels of jejunal absorption lower  than animals fed a normal-Na diet. High-Na animals were not volume expanded.  Plasma aldosterone concentrations and plasma renin activity were reduced in  high-Na animals. Bilateral adrenalectomy-nephrectomy inhibited jejunal  absorption. However, neither bilateral adrenalectomy nor bilateral nephrectomy  alone inhibited jejunal absorption. Furthermore, inhibition of angiotensin  formation in adrenalectomized animals failed to alter jejunal absorption.  Decreased jejunal absorption in high-Na animals is not due to volume expansion or  to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.","1986-09","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","G413-420","","3 Pt 1","251","","Am J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 3019157","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Diet; Nephrectomy; Intestinal Absorption/*drug effects; Adrenalectomy; Aldosterone/blood; Renin/blood; Captopril/pharmacology; Enalapril/pharmacology; Blood Volume/drug effects; Extracellular Space/drug effects/*physiology; Jejunum/*physiology; Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology; Sodium/administration & dosage/deficiency/*pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: University animal  research laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Thirty Wistar albino adult female rats were  studied; 20 rats were stimulated with gonadotropins (groups 1 and 2), and 10 were  controls (group 3). Ten of the stimulated rats received additional treatment with  enalapril (group 2). INTERVENTION(S): At the end of the treatment period, rat  ovaries were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with anti-VEGF antibodies.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): VEGF staining intensity was graded semiquantitatively,  and the H-score was calculated by light microscopic examination of the groups.  RESULT(S): VEGF expression was found to be significantly higher in the  endothelium and stroma in groups 1 and 2 compared with group 3. Although VEGF  immunoreactivity was lower in the stimulation regimen plus enalapril group  compared with the stimulation regimen-only group, the difference was  insignificant. CONCLUSION(S): Enalapril does not seem to have a significant  effect on VEGF expression in the hyperstimulated rat ovary. Because angiotensin  II exerts its multiple actions via specific receptors, there may be other  factors, such as a receptor blockade, that contribute to the VEGF expression.","2004-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1127-1132","","","82 Suppl 3","","Fertil Steril","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15474085","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Tissue Distribution; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism; Immunohistochemistry/methods; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Enalapril/*pharmacology; Staining and Labeling; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome/*metabolism; Ovary/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inhibitors feature a novel replacement for the P2/P3 dipeptide moiety normally associated with renin  inhibitors. The dipeptide replacement was a (2S,4S)-3-aza(or  oxa)-2,4-dialkylglutaric acid amide. Extensive structure-activity relationship  studies determined that optimum potency was achieved when inhibitors employed a  benzyl and butyl group at the C(4) and C(2) carbon position, respectively. In  addition, maximum in vitro potency was obtained when the N-terminus was  functionalized by incorporating a 4-(1,3-dioxabutyl)piperidine amide. SAR data  suggested that the 1,3-dioxabutyl group (methoxymethyl ether) interacted by  hydrogen bonding to groups in the S4 domain of renin. This hypothesis was  strengthened when a 4-butylpiperidine amide was substituted and inhibitor potency  decreased dramatically. Inhibitors employing this novel dipeptide mimic were  prepared by coupling the glutaric acid amides with either the transition-state  mimic (2S,3R,4S)-2-amino-1-cyclohexyl-3,4-dihydroxy-6- methylheptane (18) or the  hydroxyethylene dipeptide isostere. The glutaric acid amides were prepared by two  general procedures. The first procedure involved the reductive amination of  alpha-amino acid esters with alpha-keto esters. The second procedure involved the  displacement reaction of alpha-bromo esters or acids with alpha-amino acid  amides.","1992-05-15","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1722-1734","","10","35","","J Med Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1588554","","","","Male; Animals; Biological Availability; Structure-Activity Relationship; Molecular Sequence Data; Amino Acid Sequence; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Macaca fascicularis; Enalapril/pharmacology; Renin-Angiotensin System; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Dipeptides/pharmacology; Amides/*chemistry; Glutarates/*chemistry/pharmacology; Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this in vivo microperfusion study is to examine  whether the renal nerves modulate the effect of intraluminal angiotensin II on  proximal tubule transport. The decrement in volume reabsorption after addition of  10(-4) M luminal enalaprilat is a measure of the role of luminal angiotensin II  on transport. Acute denervation decreased volume reabsorption (2.97 +/- 0.14 vs.  1.30 +/- 0.21 nl. mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.001). Although luminal 10(-4) M  enalaprilat decreased volume reabsorption in controls (2.97 +/- 0.14 vs. 1.61 +/-  0.26 nl. mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.001), it did not after acute denervation (1.30  +/- 0.21 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.19 nl. mm(-1). min(-1)). After chronic denervation,  volume reabsorption was unchanged from sham controls (2.26 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.70 +/-  0.19 nl. mm(-1). min(-1)).

Addition of 10(-8) M angiotensin II to the lumen does  not affect transport due to the presence of luminal angiotensin II. However,  addition of 10(-8) M angiotensin II to the tubular lumen increased the volume  reabsorption after both acute (1.30 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.67 +/- 0.18 nl. mm(-1).  min(-1), P < 0.05) and chronic denervation (2.26 +/- 0.28 vs. 3.57 +/- 0.44 nl.  mm(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01). These data indicate that renal denervation abolished  the luminal enalaprilat-sensitive component of proximal tubule transport, which  is consistent with the renal nerves playing a role in the modulation of the  intraluminal angiotensin II mediated component of proximal tubule transport.","2001-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","F524-529","","3","280","","Am J Physiol Renal Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11181415","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Biological Transport/physiology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Sympathetic Nervous System/*physiology; Enalaprilat/pharmacology; Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism; Absorption/drug effects/physiology; Denervation; Angiotensin II/pharmacology/*physiology; Kidney/*innervation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LCZ696 (valsartan/sacubitril, Entresto), the first of the new ARNI  (dual-acting angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitor) drug class, contains  equimolar amounts of valsartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, and sacubitril,  a prodrug for the neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657. LCZ696 reduced blood pressure more  than valsartan alone in patients with hypertension. In the PARADIGM-HF study,  LCZ696 was superior to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril for  the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and LCZ696 was  approved by the FDA for this purpose in 2015. This approval was the first for  chronic neprilysin inhibition. The many peptides metabolized by neprilysin  suggest many potential consequences of chronic neprilysin inhibitor therapy, both  beneficial and adverse. Moreover, LBQ657 might inhibit enzymes other than  neprilysin. Chronic neprilysin inhibition might have an effect on angio-oedema,  bronchial reactivity, inflammation, and cancer, and might predispose to  polyneuropathy. Additionally, inhibition of neprilysin metabolism of amyloid-β  peptides might have an effect on Alzheimer disease, age-related macular  degeneration, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Much of the evidence for possible  adverse consequences of chronic neprilysin inhibition comes from studies in  animal models, and the relevance of this evidence to humans is unknown.

We  investigated the metabolism of exogenous BK added to the sera of 13 patients  dialyzed on an AN69 membrane with a history of HSR (HSR+ patients) and 10 others  who did not present such a reaction (HSR- patients) while dialyzed under the same  conditions. No significant difference in the t1/2 of BK was found between the  patient groups. However, the t1/2 of generated des-Arg9-BK was significantly  increased (2.2-fold) in HSR+ patients compared to HSR-subjects. Preincubation of  the sera with an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) significantly increased the t1/2 of  both BK and des-Arg9-BK in both groups. There was no significant difference  between the groups with respect to the t1/2 of BK, but there was a significantly  greater increase (3.8-fold) in the t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK in HSR+ patients compared  to HSR-subjects. The level of serum aminopeptidase P (APP) activity showed a  significant decrease in the HSR+ sera when compared to HSR-samples. In HSR- and  HSR+ patients, a significant inverse relation (r2 = 0.6271; P < 0.00005) could be  calculated between APP activity and des-Arg9-BK t1/2. In conclusion, HSR in  hemodialyzed patients who are concomitantly treated with a negatively charged  membrane and an ACE inhibitor can be considered as a multifactorial disease in  that a decreased APP activity resulting in reduced degradation of des-Arg9-BK may  lead to the accumulation of this B1 agonist that could be responsible, at least  in part, for the signs and symptoms of HSR.","1999","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","421-430","","4","20","","Peptides","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10458510","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Renal Dialysis/*adverse effects; Membranes, Artificial; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*blood; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects; Acrylic Resins; Acrylonitrile/analogs & derivatives; Aminopeptidases/*blood; Bradykinin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology; Enalaprilat/*adverse effects; Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/*metabolism; Lysine Carboxypeptidase/metabolism; Receptor, Bradykinin B1; Receptors, Bradykinin/agonists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trandolaprilat  inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and displays similar  pharmacodynamic properties to other ACE inhibitors, improving haemodynamic and  cardiac parameters in patients with essential hypertension. Trandolapril 2 to 4mg  once daily effectively controls blood pressure for at least 24 hours in patients  with mild to moderate hypertension. In a small number of double-blind comparative  trials, trandolapril had similar antihypertensive efficacy to that of atenolol,  enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and sustained release nifedipine, but  was more effective than captopril. Combined therapy with trandolapril and  hydrochlorothiazide or sustained release nifedipine had a significantly greater  antihypertensive effect than either drug treatment alone. Further comparative  trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings. The tolerability  profile of trandolapril is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors, most adverse  events being generally mild and transient in nature, and trandolapril lacks  adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, trandolapril, with  its favourable pharmacological profile and antihypertensive activity similar to  that of agents currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate  hypertension, is likely to provide a well tolerated option for the treatment of  this disease. The results of ongoing and future clinical trials will determine  its potential as a cardioprotective agent in patients following myocardial  infarction.","1994-07","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","71-90","","1","48","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7525196","","","","Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Drug Tolerance; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Indoles/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of the  English-language literature was used to identify pertinent human and animal  studies, reviews, and case reports. STUDY SELECTION: All available sources were  reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Background information was obtained from comprehensive  reviews. Individual case reports were assimilated, and pertinent data were  extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Because hypertension is common in patients with  psychiatric illness and antihypertensive agents are used for a multiplicity of  indications, significant numbers of patients receive concurrent therapy with  antihypertensives and antipsychotics. Many antipsychotics may block the  antihypertensive efficacy of guanethidine and related drugs. The interaction  between clonidine and antipsychotics is defined less clearly. Limited data  suggest possible additive hypotensive effects when chlorpromazine and methyldopa  are given in combination. Increased plasma concentrations of thioridazine with a  resultant increase in adverse effects have been reported when propranolol or  pindolol are added to the regimen. A similar increase in chlorpromazine  concentrations has been reported when propranolol was added. Although there are  no reports documenting an interaction between a calcium-channel antagonist and an  antipsychotic, the possible inhibition of oxidative metabolism of antipsychotics,  additive calcium-blocking activity, and additive pharmacodynamic effects are  theorized. Hypotension and postural syncope were reported in a patient given  therapeutic dosages of chlorpromazine and captopril, and in 2 patients when  clozapine was added to enalapril therapy. CONCLUSIONS: No  antipsychotic-antihypertensive combination is absolutely contraindicated, but no  combination should be considered to be completely without risk. Antihypertensives  with no centrally acting activity, such as diuretics, may be the least likely to  result in adverse reactions. The combination of the beta-antagonists propranolol  or pindolol with thioridazine or chlorpromazine should be avoided if possible.  Scrupulous patient monitoring for attenuated or enhanced activity of either agent  is essential whenever antipsychotics and antihypertensives are given  concurrently.","1995-06","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","603-609","","6","29","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 7663034","","","","Humans; Animals; Drug Interactions; Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/pharmacology; Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology; Sympatholytics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The responses to the  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (CAS 75847-73-3) have  been studied in essential hypertension and normotensive controls. The kinetics  and dynamics of enalapril have been characterised in an integrated  concentration-effect model to identify factors underlying responsiveness to the  ACE inhibitor. In addition models to predict the response to long-term treatment  from changes after the first dose have been developed. Enalapril response could  be described by a non linear (Emax) model defined by two parameters - the maximum  response (Emax) and the drug concentration required to cause 50% of the maximum  response (C50). Acute dosing accurately predicted the Emax after 6 weeks  treatment. In addition to individual pharmacokinetics, pretreatment blood  pressure was the most important determinant of response to enalapril. In  caucasian salt-replete essential hypertension neither age nor plasma renin  activity were major factors. However, in states of sodium restriction and/or  diuretic treatment, the response to enalapril was greatly increased. The  angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan has been reported to be without  effect on blood pressure in salt-replete normals. Salt restriction together with  furosemide for 3 days led to dose-related falls in blood pressure in normal  subjects after losartan 25-100 mg. Concentration-effect analysis can be used to  describe blood pressure responses, to predict the responses to long-term  treatment and also to identify quantitatively important factors determining the  response in individual patients.","1993-02","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","263-264","","2A","43","","Arzneimittelforschung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 8498975","","","","Humans; Animals; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects; Angiotensin II/antagonists & inhibitors; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The beneficial effects on cardiac and systemic haemodynamic parameters  seen in short term studies have been maintained in predominantly noncomparative  trials for up to 1 year, and improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA)  functional class and clinical symptoms have been observed in patients with  congestive heart failure of varying severity. In double-blind studies conducted  in small numbers of patients, the efficacy of ibopamine was comparable to that of  digoxin, captopril, enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Ibopamine can successfully  replace treatment with intravenous dopamine in patients with severe heart  failure, and is effective and well tolerated when administered in combination  with digoxin, diuretics and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.  Ibopamine has shown no detrimental effects on renal function, few adverse effects  on neurohormonal parameters and has demonstrated no significant proarrhythmic  properties at therapeutic doses in patients with congestive heart failure. No  adverse metabolic effects were observed during ibopamine therapy in patients with  diabetes mellitus, nor did ibopamine have detrimental effects in patients with  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Inhibitors were presented to the livers at  a dose of 100 micrograms. The hepatic clearance of lisinopril was very low (0.072  ml/min) and was hardly excreted into the bile. The clearances of enalapril,  perindopril and ramipril were higher at 0.63, 0.87 and 9.9 ml/min, respectively,  and were excreted into bile. The amounts of ester prodrugs excreted in bile were  4.0, 6.1 and 14%, respectively, whereas the diacid forms were excreted to the  extent of 46, 27 and 71% of the administered dose, respectively, over 4 hr.  Glucuronide metabolites were only detected in bile in significant concentrations  for perindopril and ramipril. Base hydrolysis of the perfusate samples showed  that lisinopril was not significantly metabolized to conjugates and that little  metabolism of enalapril occurred other than rapid conversion to the diacid form.  However, both perindopril and ramipril were extensively metabolized beyond the  diacid form. These differences in hepatic handling can in part be explained by  their octanol-buffer partition coefficients but may also be related to the  introduction of a bicyclic ring in perindopril and ramipril which increases their  ability to be metabolized and excreted into bile. These differences in hepatic  handling of angiotensin-converting enzyme are likely to influence their clinical  usefulness, particularly in renal and hepatic disease.","1990-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1202-1206","","3","252","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2319468","","","","Female; Animals; Rats; Liver/*metabolism; Chromatography; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/analysis/*pharmacokinetics; Bile/analysis/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicated that, compared to AP uptake in the presence of  an imposed proton gradient, AP uptake in the absence of an imposed proton  gradient had higher K(m) values and lower Jmax values. Furthermore, when  inhibition studies were performed in the absence of a proton gradient, only  natural peptides were effective, whereas the peptide analogs (e.g., enalapril)  were not. In addition to the effects of concentration and competitive inhibitors,  the results also indicated that (1) the AP uptake of both drugs was decreased  more than 60% by FCCP, regardless of whether the proton gradient was present or  absent; (2) effects of protein kinase C promoter were dependent upon the presence  of a proton gradient; and (3) AP uptake in the presence of an imposed proton  gradient was not affected by feeding restriction, whereas AP uptake in the  absence of an imposed proton gradient was. These results showed for the first  time that two substrates with similar AP uptake characteristics in the presence  of an imposed proton gradient may not share those characteristics in the absence  of an imposed proton gradient. Taken together, these results suggest that the AP  uptake component that functions in the absence of an imposed proton gradient is  distinctly different from the one that functions in the presence of an imposed  proton gradient. Data generated from the present study and those in the  literature lend support to the hypothesis that this distinctive component  represents the second binding site on the AP peptide transporter.

Circadian rhythms are endogenous in  nature, driven by oscillators or clocks, and persist under free-running (e.g.  constant darkness) conditions. The genes expressing the biological clock have  been identified in various species. The important feature of endogeneous  biological rhythms is their anticipatory character. Rhythmicity inherent to all  living systems, allows them to adapt more easily and to better survive under  changing environmental conditions during the 24 hours of a day as well as during  changing seasons. Having this in mind it is easy to conceive that not only must  the right amount of the right substance be at the right place, but also this must  occur at the right time. Also in man nearly all functions of the body including  those influencing pharmacokinetic parameters such as drug absorption and  distribution, drug metabolism and renal elimination display significant daily  variations. Also the onset and symptoms of diseases such as coronary infarction,  angina pectoris, stroke, ventricular tachycardia are circadian phase dependent.  Myocardial infarction and angina attacks as well as silent ischemias (ST-segment  depression) in stable angina pectoris have an early morning peak between 8-12 h.  In contrast, ECG abnormalities and angina attacks in variant angina mainly occur  at night. Blood pressure and heart rate in normotensives and essential (primary)  hypertensive patients display highest values during daytime followed by a nightly  drop and an early morning rise. In about 70% of forms of secondary hypertension  (e.g. renal disease, hyperthyroidisms, hormonal diseases, gestational  hypertension), however, this rhythmic pattern is abolished or even reversed  exhibiting nightly peaks in blood pressure. This form of hypertension is  accompanied by increased end organ damages. Thus, different subtypes of a disease  (angina pectoris, hypertension) can display different circadian patterns in  symptoms. These observations are a challenge for basic and clinical research to  get a better understanding on the underlying mechanisms of regulation. Moreover,  they call for a circadian time-specified drug treatment. From above it is evident  that pharmacokinetics may also not be constant within a day.  Chronopharmacokinetics have been shown for several cardiovascular active drugs  (propranolol, nifedipine, verapamil, enalapril, isosorbide-5-mononitrate,  digoxin, etc.). Far more drugs were shown to display significant daily variations  in their effects (chronopharmacodynamics, chronotoxicology) even after chronic  application or constant infusion. In conclusion, there is clear evidence that the  dose/concentration-response relationship of drugs can be significantly dependent  on the time of day. Thus, circadian time has to be taken into account as an  important variable influencing a drug's pharmacokinetics and/or its effects or  side effects.","1999","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","71-80","","3","24","","Acta Physiol Pharmacol Bulg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Bulgaria PMID: 10736610","","","","Humans; Animals; Circadian Rhythm/*physiology; *Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; *Chronobiology Phenomena; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/*drug therapy/*physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE  searches (January 1966-January 1999) and manufacturer prescribing literature were  used to identify articles on candesartan cilexetil. Bibliographies were also  reviewed for germane articles. STUDY SELECTION: Study and review articles  describing the chemistry, human pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics,  placebo-controlled trials, comparative trials, and clinical application of  candesartan cilexetil based on the published literature and premarketing clinical  trials were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: All literature on the use of candesartan  cilexetil for treating hypertension and congestive heart failure were included.  DATA SYNTHESIS: ARBs are a new class of drugs with increasing use in treating  hypertension. Studies are ongoing to determine the role of these agents in  preventing remodeling after myocardial infarction and in patients with congestive  heart failure. Candesartan cilexetil is among the newest drugs in the class that  includes losartan, irbesartan, and valsartan. Candesartan cilexetil has more than  1000 times more affinity for the angiotensin II, type AT1 receptor ARBs, and the  binding affinity and competitive angiotensin II receptor antagonism is stronger  than that of losartan. Clinical studies in patients with hypertension have  demonstrated that candesartan cilexetil, in doses of 4-16 mg, is more effective  in reducing sitting diastolic blood pressure than are placebo and losartan 50 mg.  Candesartan cilexetil has demonstrated reductions in blood pressure comparable to  those of enalapril, with the rate of adverse events greater in the enalapril  group. Dosage adjustments are not necessary in elderly patients or in patients  with mild hepatic or renal dysfunction. In diabetic patients, blood glucose,  hemoglobinA1c, and serum lipids are not affected. The clinical studies  demonstrated that the adverse effect profile of candesartan cilexetil was similar  to that of placebo and there were no dose-dependent adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS:  Candesartan cilexetil provides an alternative antihypertensive therapy that is  well tolerated and effective in reducing blood pressure in a wide range of  patients. Due to its greater binding affinity to the angiotensin II receptor,  candesartan cilexetil appears to have a longer antihypertensive effect than  losartan. This may be advantageous in decreasing morbidity and mortality  associated with hypertension, although further studies are required to validate  this potential advantage.","1999-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1287-1298","","12","33","","Ann Pharmacother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10630830","","","","Humans; Animals; Angiotensin II/*metabolism; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; *Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; *Tetrazoles; Benzimidazoles/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I.","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and moderate hypertension.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199040030-00002","","Recently there has been extensive development of orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in addition to those already marketed, for  example, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril. It was initially thought  that ACE inhibitors were likely to be most useful as antihypertensive agents in  conditions in which circulating renin and angiotensin II were elevated. However,  it is now clear that they can also lower arterial pressure when plasma renin is  not high. In addition, they have beneficial effects in cardiac failure. Thus,  captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril can be used in the treatment of  mild to moderate hypertension either alone or in conjunction with diuretics or  calcium antagonists. Broadly speaking, efficacy appears to be similar to that of  beta-blockers or diuretics. Unfortunately, however, there are no long term  studies comparing one ACE inhibitor with another or with other classes of  antihypertensive agents. Furthermore, there are no prognostic studies which show  that use of ACE inhibitors reduces morbidity or mortality in hypertension. Many  new ACE inhibitors are undergoing clinical assessment, including alacepril,  cilazapril, fosenopril, perindopril, quinapril and ramipril. The drugs vary, in  that some exist in the active form whereas others are prodrugs which are  converted to the active agent following absorption. In addition they each possess  one of several ligands, for example, carboxyl, phosphinyl or sulfhydryl groups,  and so vary in their affinity for ACE. Although many of these agents are renally  excreted, a small number are metabolised via the liver (e.g. quinapril and  spirapril) and this may prove advantageous in the presence of renal impairment.  In common with captopril and enalapril, the new ACE inhibitors inhibit the  renin-angiotensin system and initial results suggest that they are effective in  lowering blood pressure in essential hypertension. Furthermore, they reduce  systemic vascular resistance in the absence of a reflex tachycardia. There are a  number of adverse effects which are attributable to the pharmacological mechanism  of the ACE inhibitors as a group; these include hypotension, particularly in  patients with high renin levels, prior diuretic use, renal impairment or in the  elderly. Additional adverse effects may relate to chemical structure. The high  incidence of adverse effects noted in early studies related to excess dosage and  to the presence of a sulfhydryl group, which the more recently developed ACE  inhibitors lack. The adverse effects most commonly reported with established and  new ACE inhibitors include headache and fatigue, cough, skin rashes, hypotension  and diarrhoea. As a group, ACE inhibitors have an acceptable but not negligible  adverse effect burden.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1990-09","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","326-345","","3","40","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 2226219","","","","Humans; Quality of Life; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Renin-Angiotensin System/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The regulation by angiotensin II (Ang II) formed locally on nerve-stimulated purinergic and adrenergic components of double-peaked vasoconstrictions in the  canine splenic artery and Ang II receptor subtypes involved were investigated. 2.  The perfusion of the precursor angiotensin I (Ang I, 0.1-1 nm) did not affect the  vasoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline (NA, 0.03-1 nmol) and adenosine  5'-triphosphate (ATP, 0.03-1 micromol). The second component vasoconstrictor  response to nerve stimulation was dose dependently potentiated by Ang I (0.1-1  nm). The first peaked constriction was slightly, but insignificantly increased.  The potentiating effects of Ang I were abolished by KRH-594 (10 nm), a selective  AT(1) receptor antagonist, but not by PD 123319 (1-10 nm), an AT(2) receptor  antagonist. KRH-594 (10 nm) or PD 123319 (10 nm) never affected the  vasoconstrictions to either NA or ATP. 3. The treatment with KRH-594 (1-10 nm)  produced a greater inhibition on the second peaked response than the first one,  although both of them were dose dependently inhibited. PD 123319 (1-10 nm) did  not affect the vasoconstrictor responses induced by nerve stimulation. 4.  Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with 10 nm enalaprilat reduced the  second peaked response, having no significant inhibition on the first peaked  response. A higher dose of enalaprilat (100 nm) produced a greater inhibition of  the second peak than the first one. It reduced the second peak by approximately  65%, while the first peak was decreased approximately 35%. After treatment with  enalaprilat, Ang I (1 nm) failed to enhance the neuronal vascular response.  Enalaprilat at doses used did not affect the vasoconstrictions to either NA or  ATP. 5.

Depending  on the kinetics of elimination, the trough:peak ratio of short- and long-acting  ACE inhibitors has to be evaluated according to a dose regimen of twice or once a  day, respectively, and must take account of the dose used, since long-acting ACE  inhibitors appear to have a dose-dependent trough:peak effect.

Recent research has identified the regulatory  role of the imidazoline (I1) receptor in sympathetic outflow and blood pressure  regulation and this has led to the development of moxonidine, a highly selective  centrally acting antihypertensive agent. At a practical level, moxonidine is  suitable for single daily dosing in hypertension. Furthermore, in comparative  studies moxonidine has a low incidence of symptomatic adverse effects comparable,  for example, to that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, captopril and enalapril. The  antihypertensive efficacy of moxonidine has now been established in a series of  comparative clinical trials against all other first-line antihypertensive drug  classes but, in line with current concepts, it may be necessary to look beyond  blood pressure reduction. For example, centrally acting agents are known to be  effective for promoting the regression of LV hypertrophy and studies in  hypertensive patients have shown that antihypertensive treatment with moxonidine  successfully leads to significant reductions in LV mass indices. Furthermore,  there is now evidence that moxonidine has a beneficial effect on insulin  sensitivity such that there are likely to be improvements in the overall  metabolic profile. Thus, the clinical characteristics of moxonidine indicate that  it is well suited for consideration among the first-line antihypertensive  treatment choices.","1998","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","23-27","","","3","","Blood Press Suppl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Sweden PMID: 10321451","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Hypertension/*drug therapy; Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Imidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CASE SUMMARY: Girl 5 years old, diagnosed of tricodistrofia included within the  Tay-Sachs syndrome. As a consequence of a cardiac arrest suffered in the context  of a respiratory distress syndrome associated with infection by influenza A, she  developed hypertension initially treated with nifedipine and captopril. After  several months of treatment and a poor control of the hypertension, a change of  treatment was decided, substituting nifedipine by amlodipine (2.5 mg/24 hours  orally) and captopril by enalapril (2.5 mg/24 hours orally). Pharmacy service is  request to get a amlodipine syrup that allows a dose adjustment to the needs of  the patient. After the change of treatment the patient begins to maintain  diastolic blood pressure levels within the normal range, suspending the  administration of enalapril, maintaining good control of blood pressure with  amlodipine 2 mg/24 hours. DISCUSSION: Most of antihypertensive drugs used in  adults do not have clinical trials to evaluate its effects in the pediatric  population.

It crosses the placenta extensively. No teratogenic effect is known in animals or in clinical practice but the question  of a possible long-term behavioral teratogenicity has recently been pointed out.  Clonidine does not seem to be deleterious for fetal growth, mortality and  morbidity. Nothing is known about the consequences on fetal hemodynamics. The  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) captopril and enalapril  act by inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I. They cross  the placenta. No teratogenic effect has been proved for either drug. A high rate  of fetal mortality has been reported in several animal species for captopril but  the available clinical data are not sufficient to assess the role of the ACE  inhibitors in perinatal mortality, intrauterine growth retardation, and fetal  distress in humans. The fetal hemodynamic parameters may be affected by captopril  administration to the mother: blood pressure falls, plasma renin activity  increases, ACE activity decreases. As for most antihypertensive drugs, available  information on the consequences of clonidine and ACE inhibitors in the neonate  and the infant now seem sufficient to appreciate the risk in maternal therapy. In  contrast, they are still insufficient considering their known effects on fetal  hemodynamics, cardiovascular adaptation, and brain tolerance, with or without  hypoxia, as well as for their possible long-term adverse effects.","1989","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","199-204","","2-4","13","","Dev Pharmacol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 2693003","","","","Adult; Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Hypertension/drug therapy; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/drug therapy; Clonidine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Fetus/*drug effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is some  experimental evidence that vasoconstriction and nitric oxide (NO) deficiency in  the vasculature play a role in aggravating the symptoms of heart failure,  especially in patients of African-American origin. Treatment with high doses of  isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) has been shown to increase symptom-free walking time,  but tolerance to the hemodynamic effects of ISDN develops rapidly. Experimental  data suggests that hydralazine, given concomitantly, attenuates the development  of hemodynamic tolerance to ISDN and may increase bioavailability of NO in the  vasculature. In a racially mixed population, treatment with a combination of ISDN  and hydralazine reduced mortality compared to placebo to a nearly statistically  significant extent in the first Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I) but  was inferior to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor  enalapril in the V-HeFT II study. Subgroup retrospective analysis of published  data, however, suggested that ISDN/hydralazine had a substantial effect in black  patients and was apparently as effective as treatment with the ACE inhibitor,  enalapril, in the same population, but had a much smaller, if any, effect in  white patients. A recent placebocontrolled study showed that in self-identified  black patients with heart failure, ISDN/hydralazine, given in addition to current  state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy for heart failure, reduces mortality and first  hospitalizations due to heart failure and improves quality of life. The  usefulness of ISDN/hydralazine in ethnic groups other than self-identified blacks  is unknown at present and is considered off-label use. This review focuses on  ISDN/hydralazine for the management of patients with heart failure due to left  ventricular dysfunction and the adverse effects which may be encountered with  therapy.","2008-12","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","925-937","","12","44","","Drugs Today (Barc)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2008 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews  the clinical pharmacology of nebivolol and its efficacy and safety profile in  clinical studies of hypertension (the US Food and Drug Administration-approved  indication) and heart failure (off-label use). METHODS: Pertinent articles were  identified through searches of MEDLINE and Current Contents from 1966 through  December 15, 2008, using the terms nebivolol, drug interaction, pharmacokinetics,  and pharmacology. The reference lists of the identified publications were  reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at meetings of the  American Heart Association and the American Society of Hypertension from 2006  through 2008 were also reviewed. All human clinical trials were included,  regardless of design. RESULTS: Twelve published clinical trials were identified  that evaluated the use of nebivolol in the management of hypertension; 1 was  placebo controlled, 1 was placebo and active controlled, and 10 involved direct  comparisons with other antihypertensive agents. Nebivolol was reported to be as  effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) as other beta-blockers (atenolol and  bisoprolol), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril and enalapril),  the angiotensin-receptor blocker telmisartan, and calcium channel blockers  (nifedipine and amlodipine). No published studies were identified that evaluated  the effect of nebivolol on long-term cardiovascular outcomes. In data from a  study in heart failure, nebivolol was associated with a 14% reduction in  all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization at 12 months (P < 0.05).  In comparative clinical studies, nebivolol appeared to be well tolerated relative  to the other antihypertensive agents studied. The most commonly reported adverse  events with nebivolol were fatigue (4%-79%), headache (2%-24%), paresthesia  (7%-13%), bradycardia (6%-11%), rhinitis (1%-7%), and dizziness (2%-5%). Because  of differences in its pharmacologic properties, nebivolol may have potential  advantages in patients who are unable to tolerate traditional beta-blockers (eg,  patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or men who  experience erectile dysfunction while taking antihypertensive therapy).  CONCLUSIONS: Nebivolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker that has been reported  to be efficacious and well tolerated for achieving BP control in patients with  hypertension. Preliminary evidence suggests a potential for reduced mortality in  patients with heart failure.","2009-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","447-462","","3","31","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19393838","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Treatment Outcome; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Cost-Benefit Analysis; *Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists; Drug Costs; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Nebivolol; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Benzopyrans/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Ethanolamines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In  common with enalapril, it is also a prodrug. After absorption, perindopril is  hydrolysed to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, and with once daily  administration adequate 24-hour inhibition of ACE is obtained. Perindopril 4 to  8mg once daily is usually effective for blood pressure control in patients with  mild to moderate essential hypertension. Those patients who do not respond  adequately to monotherapy with perindopril usually respond with the addition of a  second agent, such as a thiazide diuretic. General practice trials indicate that  perindopril is at least as effective and as well tolerated as usual therapeutic  dosages of captopril, atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride in mild to  moderate essential hypertension. Preliminary results indicate that perindopril  may also be effective in patients with severe hypertension or congestive heart  failure. Perindopril is generally well tolerated and has an adverse effect  profile similar to that of other ACE inhibitors.

Imidapril  is a long-acting ACE inhibitor that is rapidly converted in the liver to its  active metabolite, imidaprilat. Maximum plasma concentrations of imidapril and  imidaprilat are achieved after 2 and 5-6 hours, respectively, with corresponding  elimination half-lives of 1.1-2.5 and 10-19 hours. Imidapril is used in the  treatment of hypertension, chronic heart failure, acute MI and diabetic  nephropathy. In patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, imidapril  10 mg once-daily increased exercise time and physical working capacity, decreased  plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide levels and  reduced blood pressure. It also improved left ventricular ejection fraction,  being significantly more effective than bisoprolol, in patients with acute MI.  Imidapril is well tolerated and preliminary studies suggest it has an advantage  over captopril and enalapril in terms of a lower incidence of cough. In  conclusion, imidapril is a well-investigated versatile ACE inhibitor for the  treatment of a range of cardiovascular diseases.","2006-09","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","146-154","","3","7","","J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17094051","","","","Humans; Polymorphism, Genetic; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Drug Resistance/genetics; Cardiac Output, Low/*drug therapy; Imidazolidines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was found to be an effective, non-toxic  antihypertensive agent as well as an afterload-reducing agent for patients with  congestive heart failure (CHF). The primary activity of teprotide resulted from  blockade of the angiotensin I converting enzyme--the pivotal step in the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and consequent reductions in  angiotensin II levels. There was limited clinical testing for teprotide because  of: its scarcity; the need for parenteral administration; and the subsequent  discovery and synthesis of captopril, the first orally active angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitor. Captopril is the prototype oral angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitor and has been extensively studied since the initiation  of formal studies in 1976. Perhaps one of the most closely researched drugs in  modern times, the experience with captopril now includes more than 12,000  patients studied in formalized trials and over 4,000,000 patients treated  world-wide by physicians for hypertension and congestive heart failure. Enalapril  (MK421) is the first of what appears to be a growing number of analogues which  are structurally and pharmacodynamically different from captopril; yet, they  possess the same capacity for inhibiting the activity of angiotensin converting  enzyme. The side effect profile of enalapril (and presumably future) angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors appears to be similar to captopril, though clearly  more experience is needed with newer agents. The initial use of captopril was  troubled by a relatively high incidence of side effects which will form the focus  of this discussion. Partially the result of incomplete pharmacokinetic  information, captopril was administered in early studies at dosages now  recognised to be far in excess of those necessary for drug action. In addition,  dosages were given without regard for deficiencies of renal function, now known  to be the main excretory route of captopril. The population of those patients  studied frequently had chronic, treatment-resistant hypertension, often  associated with concomitant end-organ disease (especially renal disease); and  many additional factors further complicating the clinical setting, e.g. a  relatively high incidence of collagen vascular disease and immunosuppressive  treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1986-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","122-141","","2","1","","Med Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 3023783","","","","Humans; Female; Drug Interactions; Child; Pregnancy; Kidney Diseases/chemically induced; Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced; *Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Drug Eruptions/etiology; Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced; Neutropenia/chemically induced; Hypotension/chemically induced; Captopril/*adverse effects; Respiratory Tract Diseases/chemically induced","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less drug  in the circulation reaches the enterocytes due to the lower flow (f(Q) Q(I) ) in  comparison with drug administered into the gut lumen, fostering the idea of  route-dependent intestinal removal. The SFM has been found superior to the  traditional model (TM), which views the serosa and enterocytes totally as a  well-mixed tissue perfused by 100% of the intestinal flow, Q(I) . The SFM model  is able to explain the lower extents of intestinal metabolism of enalapril,  morphine and midazolam with i.v. vs. p.o. dosing. For morphine, the urine/bile  ratio of the metabolite, morphine glucuronide MGurineMGbile for p.o. was 2.6×  that of i.v. This was due to the higher proportion of intestinally formed  morphine glucuronide, appearing more in urine than in bile due to its low  permeability and greater extent of intestinal formation with p.o. administration.  By contrast, the TM predicted the same MGurineMGbile for p.o. vs. i.v. The TM  predicted that the contributions of the intestine:liver to first-pass removal  were 46%:54% for both p.o. and i.v. The SFM predicted same 46%:54%  (intestine:liver) for p.o., but 9%:91% for i.v. By contrast, the kinetics of  codeine, the precursor of morphine, was described equally well by the SFM- and  TM-PBPK models, a trend suggesting that intestinal metabolism of codeine is  negligible. Fits to these PBPK models further provide insightful information  towards metabolite formation: available fractions and the fractions of hepatic  and total clearances that form the metabolite in question. The SFM-PBPK model is  useful to identify not only the presence of intestinal metabolism but the  contributions of the intestine and liver for metabolite formation.

Part 2.","Australian family physician","","0300-8495","","","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now widely used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. They are of particular value in  treating hypertensive patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and in  diabetics where they have been shown to delay the progression of diabetic  nephropathy. Differences in the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and  pharmacodynamics between the various ACE inhibitors generally do not translate  into significant clinical differences in the majority of patients. However,  fosinopril may be the preferred ACE inhibitor in patients with significant renal  dysfunction because of a reduced requirement for dosage reduction. The duration  of action of ACE inhibitors is determined by two properties, the plasma half-life  and the affinity of binding to tissue ACE. All of the ACE inhibitors (with the  possible exception of captopril) can provide satisfactory 24-hour blood pressure  control in the majority of patients with mild to moderate hypertension when given  once daily. Lisinopril provides consistently better 24-hour control of blood  pressure than either captopril or enalapril. Evidence for superior 24-hour blood  pressure control over enalapril has not been as well established for the other  ACE inhibitors. Captopril may be preferred for initiating therapy in patients  with severe heart failure who are at risk of first dose hypertension because of  its rapid onset of action and relatively short duration of action. There is  evidence, however, that perindopril may have a low risk of first dose  hypertension in heart failure because of its gradual onset of action. Long-acting  ACE inhibitors may be preferable for chronic therapy of heart failure. All of the  ACE inhibitors have a low incidence of adverse effects in both young and elderly  patients, and there is no convincing evidence of differences in tolerability  between the drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1995-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","639, 641-643","","4","24","","Aust Fam Physician","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 7771972","","","","Humans; Drug Tolerance; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats (10 in each group) were treated for 3 weeks with drugs or control diluents  administered daily by gavage. The agents, in general, had similar hemodynamic  effects, although these effects on cardiac mass were variable; some agents  reduced left ventricular mass and some produced no change. These effects occurred  in hypertrophied as well as nonhypertrophied chambers. Furthermore, changes in  left ventricular pumping ability were not necessarily related to the ability of  these agents to change left ventricular mass; this dissociation in performance  was neither related to change in structure nor to changes in aortic  distensibility. Thus, even within a same class of antihypertensive agents (i.e.,  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), similarly induced hemodynamic  alterations were associated with inconsistent changes in left ventricular pumping  ability or aortic distensibility regardless of whether the structure was  hypertrophied before therapy. These dissociated responses in cardiovascular  structure and function may be related to pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic  differences; alternatively, they also may be related to these differences in  action on local myocytic renin-angiotensin systems or in intramyocytic biological  responses.","1991-10","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","II2-7","","4 Suppl","18","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 1916997","","","","Male; Animals; Rats; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Rats, Inbred WKY; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology; Rats, Inbred SHR; Aorta/*drug effects/physiology; Heart/*drug effects/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ISDN is an organic nitrate that is  biotransformed into nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. Hydralazine is believed  to have both vasodilatory properties specific to the arteries and antioxidant  properties, which address both the biochemical alterations in the failing  cardiovascular system as well as the issue of nitrate tolerance. A drug regimen  combining an NO stimulator (ISDN) with an antioxidant (hydralazine) favorably  influences the nitroso-redox balance. Retrospective analyses of previous heart  failure (HF) clinical trials comparing the combination of ISDN and hydralazine  with placebo and enalapril, respectively, demonstrated a benefit in the black  population, setting the precedent for a race-based therapeutic study, the  African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT). A-HeFT examined the use of BiDil  added to standard HF therapy in blacks with New York Heart Association functional  class III and IV HF. BiDil demonstrated a 43% reduction in mortality when  compared with placebo. As a result, current evidence-based treatment guidelines  recommend that the addition of ISDN and hydralazine in black patients with  moderate to severe HF optimized on standard therapy be considered. BiDil is  currently indicated for the treatment of HF as an adjunct to standard therapy in  black patients. The use of BiDil for black patients with mild disease or in  nonblack patients with HF has not been studied. Future clinical trials involving  an ethnically and clinically diverse population of patients would further define  the role of combined ISDN and hydralazine in the treatment of HF.","2007-02","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","46-53","","1","15","","Cardiol Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17172884","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Oxidation-Reduction; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Retrospective Studies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Heart Failure/*drug therapy/physiopathology; *Black People; Hydralazine/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use; Isosorbide Dinitrate/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biliary clearance of temocaprilat  after i.v. administration of [14C]temocapril x HCl (1.0 mg/kg) in EHBR was  significantly lower than that in Sprague-Dawley rats (5.00 ml/min/kg for  Sprague-Dawley rats vs. 0.25 ml/min/kg for EHBR). The uptake of temocaprilat into  canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats was  stimulated in the presence of ATP, whereas little stimulation was observed in  CMVs from EHBR. The initial uptake rate of ATP-dependent transport of  temocaprilat showed saturation kinetics; we obtained an apparent V(max) value of  1.14 nmol/min/mg protein and a K(m) value 92.5 microM. ATP-dependent transport of  temocaprilat was competitively inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, a  typical substrate for cMOAT with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 25.8 microM.  The K(m) value for the uptake of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione into CMVs (K(m)  = 29.6 microM) was consistent with this K(i) value. In addition, the  ATP-dependent uptake of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione was inhibited by  temocaprilat in a concentration-dependent manner. Active forms of some ACE  inhibitors (benazepril, cilazapril, delapril, enalapril and imidapril) did not  affect the transport of temocaprilat into CMVs even at concentrations as high as  200 microM. These data suggest that temocaprilat is effectively excreted in bile  via cMOAT that is deficient in EHBR and that many of other ACE inhibitors have  low affinity for cMOAT.","1997-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","1304-1311","","3","280","","J Pharmacol Exp Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9067317","","","","Animals; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Species Specificity; Anion Transport Proteins; Bile/*metabolism; Carrier Proteins/*metabolism; Rats, Mutant Strains; Bile Canaliculi/metabolism; Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics; Thiazepines/*pharmacokinetics; Hyperbilirubinemia, Hereditary/*metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, ACE inhibitors are used for the cardiovascular disorders. ACE  inhibitors are primary agents for the management of hypertension, so these cannot  be avoided for further use. The present Review focuses on the implications of  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in neurodegenerative disorders such as  dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease,  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy. ACE inhibitors  such as ramipril, captopril, perindopril, quinapril, lisinopril, enalapril, and  trandolapril have been documented to ameliorate the above neurodegenerative  disorders. Neurodegeneration occurs not only by angiotensin II, but also by other  endogenous factors, such as the formation of free radicals, amyloid beta, immune  reactions, and activation of calcium dependent enzymes. ACE inhibitors interact  with the above cellular mechanisms. Thus, these may act as a promising factor for  future medicine for neurological disorders beyond the cardiovascular actions.  Central acting ACE inhibitors can be useful in the future for the management of  neuropathic pain due to following actions: (i) ACE-2 converts angiotensinogen to  angiotensin(1-7) (hepatapeptide) which produces neuroprotective action; (ii) ACE  inhibitors downregulate kinin B1 receptors in the peripheral nervous system which  is responsible for neuropathic pain. However, more extensive research is required  in the field of neuropathic pain for the utilization of ACE inhibitors in human.","2015-04-15","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","508-521","","4","6","","ACS Chem Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25680080","","","","Humans; Animals; hypertension; Alzheimer’s disease; Angiotensin converting enzyme; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; neurodegeneration; Neurodegenerative Diseases/*drug therapy/enzymology; neuropathic pain; Neuroprotective Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/metabolism; ramipril","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More  recently considerable experience has been gained with an extended release (ER)  formulation which has the convenience of once daily administration. Felodipine ER  has been well studied in patients with essential hypertension. As monotherapy in  mild to moderate essential hypertension, felodipine ER is at least as effective  in reducing blood pressure as other calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretics  and ACE inhibitors, with some results favouring felodipine ER at a statistically  significant level at the dosages used. It is also effective combined with  controlled release metoprolol or enalapril in patients with mild to moderate  essential hypertension. In patients with more severe forms of essential  hypertension uncontrolled by beta-blocker and/or diuretic therapy, felodipine ER  was effective as an 'add-on' therapy in placebo-controlled trials, and, at the  dosages used, more effective than either sustained release nifedipine or  nitrendipine. Felodipine produces effective control of blood pressure without  negative effects on cardiac performance. In addition to its antihypertensive  action, results suggest that felodipine therapy is associated with significant  regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Furthermore, it appears suitable for  use in patients with concomitant diabetes, renal dysfunction or asthma, and is  also being investigated for use in patients with congestive heart failure or  angina pectoris. Felodipine ER is an effective drug for the treatment of all  grades of essential hypertension, and can be used both as monotherapy and in  combination with other antihypertensive agents. Further clinical experience  should fully establish the long term tolerability of felodipine ER and  consequently its place in therapy relative to other accepted antihypertensive  drugs. However, with the convenience of once daily administration, felodipine ER  is a worthwhile innovation in the treatment of hypertension.","1992-08","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","251-277","","2","44","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 1382018","","","","Humans; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Delayed-Action Preparations; Angina Pectoris/*drug therapy; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Cardiomegaly/complications/drug therapy; Felodipine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of TCV-116 on blood pressure in nonpregnant or  male rabbits and rats and on blood chemistry, renal circulation, and plasma renin  activity in nonpregnant or male rabbits were examined to characterize the  toxicity in rabbits. In a 2-week repeated dose study, most nonpregnant female  rabbits receiving 3 or 100 mg/kg/day died or were sacrificed in a moribund state,  indicating that toxicity could be caused independently of pregnancy. When these  rabbits became moribund, marked hypotension, accompanied by increases in plasma  concentrations of urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium, was observed,  suggesting uremia. In a single-dose study, blood pressure in rabbits was  decreased after administration of 10 or 100 mg/kg of TCV-116, and the hypotension  was more marked and sustained than that in rats, as was the case with 30 mg/kg of  enalapril. The sustained pharmacological effect in rabbits was also confirmed  with regard to decreases in effective renal plasma flow and the glomerular  filtration rate and increased plasma renin activity. Species differences in the  hypotensive effect and mortality could not be explained by toxicokinetic data for  the active metabolite of TCV-116 in various species, which supported a  possibility that the differences in toxicity may be related to the species  difference in sensitivity to the pharmacological effect of TCV-116. We conclude  that the specific maternal toxicity of TCV-116 in rabbits may be mainly due to  the higher sensitivity of rabbits to the pharmacological effects and is caused by  marked and sustained hypotension resulting in the decrease in glomerular  filtration rate, uremia, and death.","1997-01","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","49-54","","1","35","","Fundam Appl Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9024672","","","","Male; Female; Animals; Rats; Rabbits; Administration, Oral; Species Specificity; Rats, Wistar; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Body Weight/drug effects; Eating/drug effects; *Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Renal Circulation/*drug effects; Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects; Renin/blood/drug effects; *Tetrazoles; Benzimidazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity; Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of several classes of tightly binding competitive inhibitors of  ACE has led to increased understanding of the structure and function of this  enzyme while also yielding important new drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of  hypertensive disease. Peptides from snake venom provided the first proof of the  therapeutic utility of ACE inhibitors, and a tripeptide sequence, Phe-Ala-Pro,  was used as a model for sidechain interactions with ACE in the rational design of  simpler nonpeptidic inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril. These and more  recently developed ACE inhibitors can be classified according to their structural  analogy to dipeptides or tripeptides and according to the nature of their  zinc-binding ligands, such as sulfhydryl, ketone, carboxylate, or  hydroxyphosphinyl, that contribute greatly to their binding to ACE. Several newer  ACE inhibitors have increased potency and/or improved pharmacokinetic properties  due to modifications such as substitution of the proline ring or replacement of  the methyl side chain analogous to Ala by an aminobutyl residue analogous to Lys.  The availability of structurally diverse ACE inhibitors with great potency and  specificity provides a powerful biochemical tool for purification, localization,  and characterization of ACE in different tissues, and for distinguishing related  zinc metallopeptidases with similar properties.","1987","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","S17-30","","","10 Suppl 7","","J Cardiovasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 2485059","","","","Humans; Animals; Drug Design; Peptides/pharmacology; Dipeptides/pharmacology; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/isolation & purification; Proline/chemistry; Snake Venoms/pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enalapril, a drug  whose basolateral influx and canalicular efflux are mediated by rat organic  anion-transporting polypeptide 1 (Oatp1) and rat multidrug resistance-associated  protein 2 (Mrp2), respectively, and metabolism by the carboxylesterases, was  enlisted as the example to illustrate how the transport and intrinsic clearances  are inter-related in the estimation of the hepatic and metabolic, and excretion  clearances. Moreover, simulations were performed to explore the effects of  inhibitors or inducers of transporters/enzymes to unravel the compensatory  changes of alternate pathways. Generally speaking, inhibition of one pathway led  to an apparent increase in the alternate (competing) pathway and total hepatic  clearance was decreased; induction would lead to an apparent decrease in the  alternate pathway and an increase in total hepatic clearance. A reduction in  influx clearance brought about parallel decreases in the biliary and metabolic  clearances, whereas a reduction in efflux basolateral clearance evoked similar  increases in biliary and metabolic clearances. However, the steady-state tissue  concentration (C(L,ss)) or area under the tissue concentration-time curve  (AUC(L)) was reliant only on the unbound fraction in liver, and the secretory and  metabolic intrinsic clearances and not the influx and efflux clearances.  Variations in the influx and efflux intrinsic clearances evoked temporal changes  in the tissue concentration-time profile but not the AUC(L) or C(L,ss). The  pharmacokinetic theory developed offers data interpretation from literature  reports on P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 substrates with mdr1a/1b knockout  versus wild-type mice, and rat liver perfusion studies, with and without the use  of inhibitors.

The saphenous vein grafts evaluated  histopathologically displayed a loss in their endothelium up to a ratio of 30%  and set forth indications of functional deterioration. The pharmacological  evaluations proved that the relaxation responses induced by fluvastatin and  pravastatin were significantly inhibited by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor,  N(G)-nitro-l-arginine, and cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, while these  responses were significantly increased by angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632. The  results of immunochemical studies are in accordance with the results of the  pharmacological studies that the related statins increased the levels of nitric  oxide, phospholipase A(2) and they decreased the levels of angiotensin II and  active rho kinase. On the other hand mevalonolactone, a substrate of lipid  metabolism, failed to change the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin in the  related tissue. The experimental results indicate that activation of nitric oxide  synthase and phospholipase A(2)-cyclooxygenase pathway and inhibition of  angiotensin converting enzyme and rho kinase may have a role on the effects of  fluvastatin and pravastatin in the human saphenous vein grafts.

The advent of aliskiren, the first in a novel class of orally  active, nonpeptide, highly specific, human renin inhibitors, provides a new  modality in the armamentarium of renin-angiotensin system antagonists. Studies in  marmosets and rats demonstrated that aliskiren reduced blood pressure in a  dose-dependent manner and is highly efficacious in blocking plasma renin activity  with parallel reductions in the levels of the other downstream constituents of  the renin-angiotensin system. Clinical trials in hypertensive patients have  confirmed these benefits with aliskiren whose blood pressure-lowering efficacy is  similar to or better than those of standard therapeutic doses of enalapril,  losartan, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is well tolerated, with  few reported adverse effects even at the highest doses tested.

METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through a MEDLINE/PubMed search of the  English-language literature published between January 1983 and August 2002 and a  review of the bibliographies of identified articles. RESULTS: Trandolapril has a  sufficient duration of inhibition of plasma ACE activity to allow once-daily  dosing. It is converted by esterases to the active trandolaprilat metabolite,  with mean terminal disposition half-lives of < 1 and approximately 75 hours for  the prodrug and metabolite, respectively. In comparative trials in the management  of hypertension, trandolapril 1 to 4 mg/d was statistically indistinguishable  from or superior to captopril 100 mg/d, enalapril 10 or 20 mg/d,  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg/d, nifedipine ER 30 or 40 mg/d, nitrendipine 20  mg/d, perindopril 4 mg/d, and verapamil ER 120 to 240 mg/d. In the Trandolapril  Cardiac Evaluation, trandolapril also significantly reduced all-cause mortality,  cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and progression to severe chronic heart  failure in patients with evidence of LV systolic dysfunction after AMI. In  comparative trials in the management of hypertension, the combination of  trandolapril 1 or 2 mg/d and verapamil ER 180 mg/d was statistically  indistinguishable from or superior to the combinations of atenolol 50 or 100 mg/d  plus chlorthalidone 12.5 or 25 mg/d, captopril 50 mg/d plus HCTZ 25 mg/d,  lisinopril 20 mg/d plus HCTZ 12.5 mg/d, and metoprolol 100 mg/d plus HCTZ 12.5  mg/d. The most common adverse effects of trandolapril monotherapy in clinical  trials of < or = 1 year's duration included cough, dizziness, and diarrhea  (frequency < or = 1.9%). The most common adverse effects of  trandolapril/verapamil ER therapy in clinical trials of < or = 1 year's duration  included first-degree atrioventricular block, bradycardia, constipation, cough,  diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, and dyspnea (frequency < or = 4.6%). Based on the  literature search, there are no published pharmacoeconomic evaluations of  trandolapril alone or combined with verapamil ER in the US health care setting.  CONCLUSIONS: Based on the literature, trandolapril is a well-tolerated and  effective antihypertensive agent, whether used alone or in combination with  verapamil ER. These products may be valuable in patients with LV systolic  dysfunction after AMI, although the combination product is approved for the  management of hypertension only.","2003-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","713-775","","3","25","","Clin Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12852701","","","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Drug Combinations; Acute Disease; Hypertension/drug therapy; Heart Failure/drug therapy; Myocardial Infarction/drug therapy; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Indoles/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Vasodilator Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Verapamil/administration & dosage/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systolic Hypertension in Europe (SYST-EUR) Trial Investigators.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","","0194-911X","10.1161/01.hyp.29.2.659","","We explored how in parallel-group trials interindividual variability, correction for placebo effects, and smoothing of blood pressure profiles can be handled in  measuring the trough-to-peak ratio in 244 individuals with isolated systolic  hypertension (> or = 60 years) enrolled in the placebo-controlled Systolic  Hypertension in europe Trial. Net treatment effects were computed by subtracting  the mean changes from baseline during placebo (n = 133) from those during active  treatment (n = 111). At entry, systolic/diastolic pressures averaged 176/86 mm Hg  in the clinic and 149/80 mm Hg on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. With corrections  applied for baseline and placebo, nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg/d), with the possible  addition of enalapril (5 to 20 mg/d) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25  mg/d), reduced (P < .001) these blood pressure values by 16.6/7.3 and 9.8/4.7 mm  Hg, respectively. The net trough-to-peak ratios were first determined from blood  pressure profiles (12 hours) with 1-hour precision, synchronized by the morning  and evening doses of the double-blind medication. According to the usual  approach, disregarding interindividual variability, the systolic/diastolic net  trough-to-peak ratios were 0.46/0.40 in the morning and 0.77/0.99 in the evening.  In individual subjects, the baseline-adjusted trough-to-peak ratios were  nonnormally distributed. We therefore used a nonparametric technique to calculate  the net trough-to-peak ratios from the results in individual subjects. In the  morning, these ratios averaged 0.25 systolic (95% confidence interval, 0.09 to  0.41) and 0.15 diastolic (95% confidence interval, 0.00 to 0.31) and in the  evening, 0.19 and 0.36 (95% confidence intervals, 0.00 to 0.38 and 0.14 to 0.56),  respectively. When the blood pressure profiles were smoothed by substituting the  1-hour averages by moving or fixed 2-hour averages or by Fourier modeling, the  trough-to-peak ratios remained unchanged after the morning dose (0.20/0.13,  0.20/0.14, and 0.16/0.21, respectively) but tended to increase in the evening  (0.32/0.38, 0.28/0.40, and 0.48/0.49). In conclusion, the parallel-group analysis  proposed makes it possible for one to correct the trough-to-peak ratio for  baseline as well as placebo, to account for interindividual variability, and to  calculate a confidence interval for the net trough-to-peak ratio. Accounting for  interindividual variability reduces the trough-to-peak ratio. Smoothing affects  the individualized net trough-to-peak ratios in an unpredictable way and should  therefore be avoided.","1997-02","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","659-667","","2","29","","Hypertension","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 9040453","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Follow-Up Studies; Blood Pressure/*drug effects; Hypertension/drug therapy; Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the first of a new class of drugs to be introduced for clinical  use in hypertension. This novel agent binds competitively and selectively to the  AII subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor, thereby blocking AII-induced physiological  effects. An active metabolite, E3174, contributes substantially to its  antihypertensive effect, which persists throughout 24 hours after once-daily  administration. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, losartan  potassium 50 to 100mg once daily as monotherapy lowers blood pressure to a  similar degree to enalapril, atenolol and felodipine extended release (ER).  Losartan potassium combined with hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure  further than either drug given separately. About one-third of patients with  severe hypertension have responded to the combination product. Losartan potassium  appears to be effective in elderly patients. Losartan potassium is very well  tolerated. In clinical trials, dizziness was the only drug-related event reported  more frequently with losartan potassium monotherapy than with placebo. First-dose  hypotension is uncommon. An aspect of the drug's tolerability profile which may  prove to be particularly advantageous is that it is associated with a similar  incidence of cough to placebo in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-related  cough. Additionally, clinically relevant adverse metabolic effects or laboratory  abnormalities have not been documented during losartan potassium therapy and  renal function is preserved in patients with or without renal insufficiency. The  adverse effect profile of the losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide combination  resembles those for losartan potassium monotherapy and placebo. Long term  tolerability data are limited (<2 years) but support the very good tolerability  profile in shorter studies. Elements of the drug's profile yet to be assessed or  reported fully in the literature include long term efficacy; potential to  favourably influence cardiovascular and renovascular systems (and ultimately  mortality) in patients with hypertension and, lastly, cost effectiveness and  influence on quality of life. In summary, losartan potassium is the first AT(1)+  receptor antagonist to become available for the management of hypertension and,  as such, it is an important new antihypertensive agent. Pending long term data as  outlined above, it is likely to find initial use in patients with mild to severe  hypertension who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of their current therapy.  However, with its novel mechanism of action, good efficacy and favourable  tolerability profile, losartan potassium is well placed to claim a prominent  position in the management of patients with essential hypertension in the future.","1996-05","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","820-845","","5","51","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 8861549","","","","Humans; Losartan; Hypertension/*drug therapy/physiopathology; Tetrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Biphenyl Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Imidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An updated review of its therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure.","Drugs","","0012-6667","10.2165/00003495-199549030-00008","","Ramipril is a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Like enalapril, it is a prodrug and is hydrolysed in vivo to release the active  metabolite, ramiprilat, which has a long elimination half-life, permitting  once-daily administration. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril has been  confirmed in large-scale noncomparative studies conducted in general practice as  well as in more rigorously controlled clinical trials. In the former,  approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension have  responded successfully to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg/day, while  comparative trials indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug is  equivalent to that of other established ACE inhibitors and the beta-adrenoceptor  antagonist atenolol. As expected, the response rate to ramipril monotherapy is  lower in patients with severe hypertension (around 40%), although the blood  pressure lowering effect can be enhanced with the addition of a diuretic such as  hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide. The antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril is  maintained in patients with diabetes mellitus and preliminary data indicate that  the drug has the beneficial effect of decreasing urinary albumin excretion in  diabetic patients with nephropathy. Ramipril is superior to atenolol in causing  regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, although the clinical significance of  this effect per se remains to be established. The large-scale Acute Infarction  Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) study demonstrated that ramipril 5 or 10 mg/day  significantly decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 27% in patients with  clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction, even if  transient. The beneficial effect of ramipril was apparent by 30 days of treatment  and appeared to be greatest in patients with more severe ventricular damage after  infarction. Ramipril is well tolerated in general practice, with 5% or fewer  patients discontinuing therapy because of drug intolerance. The data available  suggest that ramipril shares a similar tolerability profile to that of other  established ACE inhibitors. Thus, clinical data confirm ramipril as a useful  alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate  hypertension, and indicate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with  clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. It is also  reasonable to assume that ramipril will be of value in the treatment of patients  with more established heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.","1995-03","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","440-466","","3","49","","Drugs","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 7774515","","","","Humans; Male; Female; Diabetes Complications; Aging/metabolism; Hemodynamics/drug effects; Kidney/drug effects; Vascular Resistance/drug effects; Heart Failure/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/complications/drug therapy; Kallikrein-Kinin System/drug effects; Myocardial Infarction/complications/drug therapy; Ramipril/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inhibition of the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) provides beneficial effects in  hypertensives. The association of low-dosed diuretics in combination with RAAS  blocking agents allows maximum benefit from potassium depletion and control of  compensatory increase in renin secretion, so increasing the efficacy and safety  of RAAS blockers. Irbesartan is a potent and selective angiotensin II subtype 1  receptor antagonist indicated for use in patients with hypertension, including  those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. Once-daily irbesartan  administration provides 24h control of BP. In patients with mild-to-moderate  hypertension, irbesartan was as effective as enalapril, atenolol and amlodipine,  and more effective than losartan and valsartan in terms of absolute reduction in  BP and response rate. Irbesartan also induced regression of left ventricular  hypertrophy. Moreover, irbesartan 300 mg/day exerts a significant renoprotective  effect in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. The relative risk of doubling of  serum creatinine was significantly lower with irbesartan than amlodipine or  placebo. Irbesartan was also effective in non-diabetic nephropatic patients.  Moreover, irbesartan has peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonistic  effects in in vitro studies, and it also demonstrated beneficial effects on  inflammatory markers of atherosclerosis and endothelial function. The overall  incidence of adverse events is similar to that of placebo. A fixed dose of  hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and irbesartan shows additive antihypertensive effect  in a dose dependent manner up to HCTZ 25 mg and irbesartan 300 mg with high  tolerability in diverse patient groups. Combination effects on end organ  protection must be evaluated by broad spectrum studies. Ongoing trials about  irbesartan and its combination with diuretics may provide necessary data to  interpret the value of this association among others.","2009-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","120-136","","2","7","","Curr Vasc Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 19355995","","","","Humans; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Hypertension/drug therapy/physiopathology; Irbesartan; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Antihypertensive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Tetrazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics; Hydrochlorothiazide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This investigation intended to detect  the most critical drug-drug interactions in hospitalized elderly patients,  weighting clinical risk. We conducted a cross-sectional study between January and  April 2014; all patients 70 years or older, hospitalized for >24 hr and  prescribed at least one medication were included in the study. Drug-drug  interactions were estimated by combining Stockley's, Hansten and Tatro drug  interactions. Drug-drug interactions were weighted using a risk-analysis method  based on failure modes, effects and criticality analysis. We calculated a  criticality index for each drug involved in the drug-drug interactions based on  the severity of the interaction mechanism, the frequency the drug was involved in  drug-drug interactions and the risk of drug-drug interactions in patients with  impaired renal function. The average number of drugs consumed in the hospital was  6 ± 2.69, involving 160 active ingredients. The most frequent were as follows:  Furosemide, followed by Enalapril. Of drug-drug interactions, 2% were classified  as contraindicated, 14% advised against and 83% advised caution during the  hospital stay. Thirty-four drug-drug interactions were assessed, of which 23 were  pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions and 12 were pharmacokinetic drug-drug  interactions (1 was both). The clinical risk calculated for each drug-drug  interaction included heparins + non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or  Digoxin + Calcium Gluconate, cases which are pharmacodynamic drug-drug  interactions with agonist effect and clinical risk of bleeding, one of the most  common clinical risks in the hospital. An index of clinical risk for drug-drug  interactions can be calculated based on severity by the interaction mechanism,  the frequency that the drug is involved in drug-drug interactions and the risk of  drug-drug interactions in an elderly patient with impaired renal function.","2016-04","2023-10-27 11:23:37","2023-10-27 11:23:37","","298-305","","4","118","","Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26432499","","","","Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; *Drug Interactions; Mexico; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism; Models, Theoretical; *Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors/adverse effects; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/adverse effects; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/enzymology/epidemiology/*etiology; Hospital Bed Capacity, 300 to 499/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
